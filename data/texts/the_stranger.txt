mother died today or maybe yesterday i can’t be sure th e telegram from the home say s your mother passed away f uneral tomorrow deep sympathy which leaves th e matter doubtful it could have been yesterday the home for aged persons is at maren go som e fifty m iles from algiers with the two o’clock bus i shoul d get there well before night fall th en i can spend the night there keeping the usual vigil besi de the body and be back here by tom orrow evening i have fixed up with m y employe r for two days’ leave obviously under t he circum stances he couldn’t refuse still i had an idea he looked annoyed and i said without thi nking “sorry sir but it’s not my fault you know” afterward s it struck me i need n’t have sa id that i had no reason to excuse m yself it was up to him to express his sym pathy and so forth probably he will do so the da y after tom orrow when he sees me in black for the present it’s alm ost as if mother weren’t really dead the funeral will bring it home to m e put an official seal on it so to speak i took the twoo’clock bus it was a blazing hot afternoon i’d lunched as usual at céleste’s restaurant everyone was m ost kind and céleste said to me “there’s no one like a mother” when i left they came with me to the door it was something of a rush getting away as at the last mo ment i had to call in at emmanuel’s place to borrow his black tie and m ourning band he lost his uncle a few m onths ago i had to run to catch the bus i suppose it was my hurrying like that wh at with the glare off the road and from the sky the reek of gasoline and the jolts that m ade me feel so drowsy anyhow i slept m ost of th e way when i woke i was leaning against a soldier he grinned and asked me if i’d come from a long way off and i just nodded to cut things short i wasn’t in a m ood for talking the ho me is a little over a m ile from the v illage i went there on foot i asked to be allowed to see mother at once but the doorkeeper told m e i must see the warden first he wasn’t free and i had to wait a bit the doorkeeper chatted with me while i waited th en he led me to the office th e warden was a ver y small man with g ray hair and a legion of honor ro sette in his butt onhole he gave me a long look wit h his watery blue eyes then we shook hands and he held m ine so long t hat i began to feel embar rassed aft er that he consulted a register on his tabl e and said “madame meursault entered the ho me thr ee years ago she ha d no pri vate m eans and depended entirely on you” i had a feeling he was blam ing m e for some thing and started to explain but he cut m e short “there’s no need t o excuse yourself my boy i’ve looke d up t he record and obviously you weren’t in a position to s ee that she was properly cared for she needed someone to be with her all the time and young m en in jobs like yours don’t get too m uch pay in any case sh e was mu ch happier in the ho me” i said “yes sir i’m sure of that” then he added “she had good friends here you know old folks li ke herself and one gets on better with people of one’s ow n generation you’re much too young you couldn’t have been m uch of a co mpanion to her” that was so when we lived t ogether mother was always watching me but we hardly ever talked during her first few we eks at the ho me she used to cry a go od deal but that was only because she hadn’t settled down after a month or two she’d have cried if she’d been told to leave the hom e because this too would have been a wrench that was why during the last year i seldom went to see her also it w ould have m eant losing m y sunday—not t o mention the troubl e of goi ng to the bus getting m y ticket and spending tw o hours on the journey each way the warden went on talking but i didn’t pay m uch attention finally he said “now i suppose you’d like to see your mother” i rose without repl ying and he led the way to the door as we were going down the stairs he explained “i’ve had the body m oved to our little m ortuary—so as not to upset the other old people you understand every time there’s a death here they ’re in a nervous state for two or three days which m eans of cour se extra work and worry for our staff” we crossed a courtyard where there were a num ber of old men talking am ongst them selves in little groups they fell silent as we came up with them then behind our backs the chattering began again th eir voices rem inded me of parakeets in a cage only the sound wasn’t quite so shril l the warden stopped outside t he entrance of a sm all low building “so here i leave you monsieur meursa ult if you want me for anything you’ll find me in m y office we propose to have the fune ral tom orrow m orning that will enable you to spend the night beside your m other’s coffin as no doubt you would wish to do just one m ore thing i gat hered from your mother’s fri ends that she wished to be buried with the rites of the church i’ve made arra ngements for thi s but i thought i should let you know ” i thanked him so far as i knew m y mother though not a professed atheist had never given a thought to religion in her life i entered t he mortuary it was a bright spotlessly clean room with whit ewashed walls and a big skyli ght the furnit ure consis ted of som e chairs and trestles two of the latter stood open in the center of the r oom and the coffin rested on them the lid was in place but the screws had been give n only a few turns and their ni ckeled heads stuck out above the wood which was stained dark walnut an arab woman—a nurse i supposed— was sitting beside the bier she was wearing a blue sm ock and had a rather gaudy sca rf wound round her hair just then t he keeper came up behind me he’d evidently been running as he was a little out of breath “we put t he lid on but i was t old to unsc rew it when you came so that you coul d see her ” while he was going up to the coffin i t old him not to trouble “eh what’s that” he exclaimed “you don’t want me to ” “no” i said he put back the screwdriver in his pocket a nd stared at me i r ealized then that i shoul dn’t have said “no” an d it m ade me rather em barra ssed after eying m e for some m oments he asked “why not ” but he didn’t sound repro achful he simply wanted to know “well real ly i couldn’t say” i answered he began twiddling his white mustache th en without looki ng at m e said gently “i underst and” he was a pleasantlooki ng m an with bl ue eyes and ruddy c heeks he drew up a chair for me n ear the coffin and seated himself just behind the nurse got up and moved toward the door as she was going by the keeper whispered in my ear “it’s a tumor she has poor thi ng” i looked at her m ore carefully and i noti ced that she had a bandage round her head just below her eyes it lay quite flat across the bri dge of her nose and one saw hardly anything of her face except that strip of whiteness as soon as she had gone the keeper rose “now i’ll leave you to yourself” i don’t know whether i made some gesture but instead of going he halted behind my chair the sensation of som eone poste d at my back made me unco mfortable the sun was getting low and the whole room was flooded with a pleasant mellow light two hornets were buzzing overhead against the skylight i was so sleepy i could hardly keep m y eyes open without looki ng round i asked the keeper how long he’d been at the hom e “five year s” the answer came so pat that one could have thought he’d been expecting m y question that started him off and he became quite chatty if anyone had told him ten years ago that he’d end hi s days as doorkeeper at a home at marengo he’d never have believed it he was si xtyfour he said a nd hailed from paris when he said that i broke in “ah you don’t com e from here” i remem bered then that before taking m e to the warden he’d told m e something about mother he had said she’d have to be buried m ighty quickly because of the heat in these parts especially down in t he plain “at paris they keep the body for three days som etimes four” after that he ha d mentioned that he’d spent the best part of his life in paris a nd could never m anage to forget it “here” he had said “t hings have to go with a rush like you’ve hard ly time to get used to the idea that someone’s dead before you’re hauled off to the funeral” “that’s enough” his w ife had put in “you didn’t ought t o say such things to the poor young gentl eman” the old fellow had blushed and begun to apologize i told him it was quite all right as a matter of fact i found it rather interesti ng what he’d been telling me i hadn’t thought of that before now he went on to say that he’d entered the ho me as an ordi nary inm ate but h e was still quite hale and hearty and when the keeper’s job fell vacant h e offered to take it on i pointed out that ev en so he was r eally an inm ate like the others but he wouldn’t hear of it he was “ an official like” i’d been struck before by his habit of saying “they” or less ofte n “them old folks ” when referring to inm ates no ol der t han himself still i could see his point of vie w as doorkeeper he had a certain standing and some authorit y over the rest of them just then the nurse returned night had fallen very quickl y all of a sudden it seemed the sky went black above the sky light the keeper switched on the lamps and i was alm ost blinded by the blaze of light he suggested i shoul d go to the refectory for dinner but i wasn’t hungry then he proposed bringing me a mug of café au lait as i am very partial to café au lait i said “thanks” and a few m inutes later he came back with a tray i drank the coffee and then i wanted a cigarette but i wasn’t sure if i should sm oke under the circu mstances—in mother’s presence i t hought it over re ally it di dn’t seem to matter so i offered the keeper a cigarette and we both sm oked after a wh ile he started talking again “you know your mother’s fri ends will be com ing soon to keep vigil with you beside the body we always have a ‘vigil’ here when anyone di es i’d better go and get some chairs and a pot of black coffee” the glare off the white walls was making m y eyes smart and i asked him if he couldn’t turn off one of the lam ps “not hing doing” he said they’d arranged the lights like that either one had them all on or none at all after that i di dn’t pay m uch more attention t o him he we nt out brought som e chairs and set them out round the coffin on one he placed a coffeepot a nd ten or a dozen cups then he sat down facing me on the far side of mother the nurse was at the other end of t he room with her back to me i couldn’t see what she was doing but by the way her arms moved i guessed that she was knitting i was feeling very comfortable the coffee had warmed me up and through the open door came scents of flowers and breaths of cool night air i think i dozed off for a while i was wakened by an odd rust ling in m y ears after having had m y eyes closed i had a feeling t hat the light had grown even stronger than before there wasn’t a tra ce of shadow anywhere and every object each curve or angle seemed to score its outline on one’s eyes the old people moth er’s friends were com ing in i counted ten in all gliding alm ost soundlessly t hrough the bleak white glare none of the chairs creaked when they sat down never in my life had i seen anyone so clearly as i saw these people not a detail of their cl othes or features escaped me and yet i couldn’t hear them and it was hard to believe they really existed nearly all the women wore aprons and the strings drawn tight round t heir waists made their big stomachs bulge still m ore i’d never yet notic ed what big paunches old wom en usually have most of the m en how ever were as thin as rakes and they all carried sticks what struck me m ost about their faces was that one c ouldn’t see their eyes only a dull glow in a sort of nest of wrinkl es on sitting down they looked at m e and wagged their heads awkwardly their lips sucked in between their toot hless gum s i c ouldn’t decide if they were greeting me and trying to say something or if it was due to some infirm ity of age i inclined to think that they were greeting me after their fashion but it had a queer effect s eeing all those old fellows grouped round t he keep er solem nly eying me and dandling t heir heads from side to side for a m oment i had an abs urd impression that they had co me to sit in judgm ent on me a few minutes later one of the wom en star ted weeping she was in the second row and i coul dn’t see her face because of anot her woman in front at regular intervals she em itted a little choking sob one had a f eeling she would never stop the others didn’t seem to notice they sat in silence slumped in their chairs staring at the coffin or a t their walking st icks or any obj ect just in front of them and never took their eyes off it and still the woman sobbed i was rather surprised as i didn’t know who she was i wanted her t o stop cryi ng but da red not speak to her after a while the keeper bent toward her and whispered in her ear but she me rely shook her head mumbled something i couldn’t catch and went on sobbi ng as steadily as before the keeper got up a nd m oved his chair beside mine at first he kept silent then without looking at me he explained “she was devoted to your m other she says your m other was her onl y friend i n the world and now she’s all alone” i had nothing t o say and the si lence la sted quite a while presently the wo man’s sighs and sobs became less frequent and after blowing her nose and snuffling for some m inutes she too fell silent i’d ceased feeling sleepy but i was very tir ed and my legs were aching badly and now i realized that the silence of these people was telling on m y nerves the only sound was a rather queer one it came only now and then and at first i was puzzled by it however after listening attentively i guessed what it was the old m en were sucking at the insides of their cheeks a nd this caused the odd wheezing noi ses that had m ystified me they were so m uch abso rbed in their t houghts t hat they di dn’t know what they were up to i even had an im pression t hat the dead body in their midst meant nothing at all to them but now i suspect that i was m istaken about thi s we all drank the coffee which the ke eper handed round after that i can’t remember m uch somehow the night went by i can recall only one moment i had opened my eyes and i saw the old men sl eeping hunched up on their chairs with one exception resting his chin on his hands clas ped round hi s stick he was staring hard at me as if he had been waiting for m e to wake then i fell asleep again i woke up after a bit because the ache in my l egs had developed into a sort of cramp there was a glimmer of dawn above the s kylight a m inute or two later one of the old m en woke up and coughed repeatedly he spat into a big check handkerchief and each time he spat it sounded as if he were retching this woke the ot hers and t he keeper told them it was ti me to mak e a m ove they all got up at once their faces were ashen gray aft er the long uneasy vig il to m y surprise each of them shook hands wit h me as though this night togeth er in which we hadn’t exchanged a word had created a kind of intimacy between us i was quit e done in the keeper took m e to his room and i tidied m yself up a bit he gave me some m ore “wh ite” coffee and it seemed to do me good when i went out the sun was up a nd the sky m ottled red above the hills betw een marengo and the sea a mo rning breeze was blowing and it ha d a pleasant s alty tang there was t he prom ise of a very fine day i hadn’t been in the country for ages and i caught m yself thinking what an agreeable walk i could ha ve had if it hadn’t been for mother as it was i waited in the courtyard under a plane tree i sniffed the sm ells of t he cool earth and found i wasn’t sleepy any m ore then i thought of t he other fellows in the office at this hour they’d be getting up preparing to go to work for me this was always the worst hour of the day i went on thinki ng like this for ten m inutes or so then the sound of a bell insi de the buildin g attracted m y atte ntion i could see movements behind the windows then all wa s calm again the sun had risen a little higher and was beginning to warm my feet the keeper came across the yard and said the warden wis hed to see m e i went to his office and he got me to sign some document i noticed that he was in black w ith pinstripe trousers he picked up the telephone receiver and looked at me “the undertaker’s men arrive d some moments ago and th ey will be going to the mortuary to screw down the coffin shall i te ll them to wait for you to have a last glimpse of your m other” “no” i said he spoke into the receiver lo wering his voice “that’s all right figeac tell the men to go there now” he then inform ed me that he was going to attend the funeral and i thanked him sitting down behind his desk he crossed hi s short legs and leaned back besides the nurse on duty he tol d me he and i would be the only m ourners at the funeral it was a rule of the hom e that inmates shoul dn’t attend funerals though t here was no objection t o letting some of them sit up beside the coffin the night before “it’s for t heir own sakes” he explained “to spare their feelings but in this particular instance i’ve given perm ission to an old friend of your m other to come with us his nam e is thomas pérez” the wa rden sm iled “it’s a rather touching little story in its way he and you r mother had become al most inseparable the other old people used to tease pérez about having a fiancée ‘when are you goi ng to m arry her’ they’d ask he’d t urn it with a laugh it was a standi ng joke in fact so as you can guess he feels very ba dly about your m other’s death i thought i couldn’t decently refuse him permission to attend the funeral but o n our medical officer’s advice i forbade him to sit up beside the body last night” for som e time we sat there without speaki ng then the warden got up and went to the window presently he said “ah there’s the padre from marengo he’s a bit ahead of time” he warned m e that it would t ake us a good three quarters of an hour walking to the church which was in the villa ge then we went downstairs the priest was waiting just outside the mortuary door w ith him were t wo acolytes one of whom had a censer the pr iest was stooping ove r him adjusting th e length of t he silver chain on which it hung when he saw us he straight ened up and said a few words to me addressing m e as “my son” then he led the way into the mortuary i noticed at once that four men in black were standing behind the coffi n and the screws in the lid had now been driven home at the same m oment i heard the warden remark that the hearse had arrived a nd the priest starting his prayers then everybody made a move holdi ng a strip of bl ack cl oth the four m en approached the coffin while the priest the boys and myself filed out a lady i hadn’t seen before was standing by the door “thi s is monsi eur meursault” the warden said to her i didn’t catch her name but i gathered she wa s a nursing sister attach ed to the home when i was introduced she bowed without the trace of a sm ile on her long gaunt face we stood aside from the doorway to let the coffin by then following the bearers down a corridor we came to the fr ont entrance wh ere a hearse was waiting oblong gl ossy varni shed black all over i t vaguely rem inded me of the pen trays i n the office beside the hearse stood a quaintly dressed little m an whose duty it was i understood to supervise the funeral as a sort of master of ceremonies near him looki ng constrained alm ost bashful was ol d m pérez my moth er’s special friend he wore a soft felt hat with a puddin gbasin crown and a very wide brim —he whisked it off the m oment the coffin emerged from the doorway—trousers that concertina’d on his shoes a black tie much too small fo r his hi gh white double collar under a bulbous pi mply nose his lips were trembling but what caught m y attention most was his ears pendulous scarlet ears that showed up like blobs of sealing wax on the pallor of his cheeks and were fra med in wisps of silky white hair the undertaker’s factotum shepherded us to our pl aces with the priest in front of the hearse and the four men in black on each side of it the warden and mys elf cam e next and bringing up the r ear old pérez and the nurse the sky was already a blaze of light and the air stoking up rapidl y i felt the first waves of heat lapping m y back and my da rk sui t made things worse i couldn’t imagine why we waited so l ong for getti ng under way old pérez who had put on his hat took i t off again i had turned sligh tly in his di rection and was looking at him when the warden started tellin g me m ore about him i remem ber his saying that old pérez and m y mother used oft en to have a longish stroll t ogether in the cool of the evening sometim es they we nt as far as the village accompanied by a nurse of course i looked at the countryside at the long lines of cypresses sl oping up t oward the skyline and the hills the hot re d soil dapp led with vivid green and here and there a lonely house sharply outli ned against the light—and i could understa nd mother’s feelings evenings in these parts must be a sort of mournful sol ace now in the full glare of the m orning sun with everythi ng shimmering in the heat haze there was something inhum an discouragi ng about this landscape at last we mad e a move on ly then i noticed that pére z had a slight limp the old chap steadily lost ground as the hearse gain ed speed one of the men beside it too fell back and drew level with me i was surprised to see how quickl y the sun was climbing up the sky and just then it st ruck me that for quite a while the air had be en throbbing with the hum of insects and th e rustle of grass wa rming up sweat was runni ng down m y face as i had no hat i trie d to fan m yself with m y handkerchief the undertaker’s man turned t o me and said something t hat i didn’t catch at that same time he wiped the crown of his head w ith a handkerchief that he held in his left hand while with his right he tilted up his hat i asked him what he’d said he pointed upward “sun’s pre tty bad today ain’t it” “yes” i said after a while he asked “is it your m other we’re burying” “yes” i said again “what was her age” “well she was getting on” as a m atter of fact i didn’t know exactly how old she was after that he kept silent looking back i saw pérez lim ping al ong som e fifty yards behind he was swinging his big felt hat at arm ’s length trying to make the pace i also had a look at the warden he was wa lking with carefully m easured steps econom izing every gesture beads of perspi ration glistened on his forehead but he didn’t wipe them off i had an im pression that our lit tle processi on was moving slightly faster wherever i looked i saw the same sundrenched country side and the sky was so dazzling that i dared not raise my eyes presently we st ruck a patch of freshly tarred road a shimmer of heat played over it and one’s feet squelched at each step leaving bright black gashes in front the coachman’s gl ossy black hat looked like a lum p of the same sticky substa nce poised above t he hearse it gave one a que er dream like impression that bl uewhite glare overhead and all this blackness round one the sl eek black of the hearse t he dull black of the me n’s clothes and the silveryblack gashes in the road and then there were the sm ells smells of hot leather and horse dung from the hearse veined with whiffs of incense s moke wh at with these and th e hangover from a poor night ’s sleep i found m y eyes and thoughts growing blurred i looked back again pérez seemed very far away now alm ost hidden by the heat haze then abruptly he di sappeared altogether after puzzling over it for a b it i guessed that he had turned off t he road into the fields then i n oticed that there was a bend of the road a little way ah ead obviously pérez who knew the district well had taken a short cut so as to catch up with us he rejoined us soon after we were round the bend then began to lose ground agai n he took another s hort cut and met us again farther on in fact this happened se veral times during the next halfhour but soon i l ost interest in his m ovements m y temples were throbbing and i could hardly drag m yself along after that everything went with a rush and also with such pre cision and matterof factness that i remember har dly any de tails ex cept that when we were on th e outskirts of the village the nurse said something to m e her voice took me by surprise it didn’t m atch her face at all it was m usical and slightly trem ulous what she said was “if you go too sl owly there’s the risk of a h eatstroke but if you go t oo fast you perspire and the cold air in th e church gives you a chill” i saw her point either way one was in for it some other memories of the funeral have stuck in my mind the old boy’s face for instance when he caught up with us for the last time just outside the village his eyes were streaming with tears of exha ustion or distress or bot h together but because of the wrinkles they co uldn’t flow down they spread out crisscrossed and formed a s mooth gloss on the old worn face and i can remem ber the look of the chur ch the villagers in the street the red geranium s on the graves pérez’s fainting fit—he crum pled up like a rag doll—the tawnyred earth pattering on mother’s coffin the bits of white roots m ixed up with it then m ore people voices the wait outside a caf é for the bus the rumbl e of the engine and m y little thrill of pleasure wh en we entered the first brightly lit streets of algiers and i pictured m yself going st raight t o bed and sleeping twelve hours at a stretch ii on waking i understood why m y employer ha d looked rather cross when i asked for m y two days off it’s a saturday today i hadn’t thought of this at the time it only struck me when i was getting out of bed obviousl y he had seen that it would mean my getting four days’ holiday straight off and one couldn’t expect him t o like that still for one thing it wasn’t my fault if mother was buried yest erday and not today and then again i’d have had m y saturday and sunday off i n any case but naturally this didn’t prevent me from seeing m y employer’s point getting up was an effort as i’d been r eally exhausted by the previous day’s experiences while shaving i wondered how to spend the morning and decided that a swim would do m e good so i caught the streetcar that goes down to the harbor it was qui te like old tim es a lot of young people were in t he swimming pool amongst them marie cardona who used to be a typist at the office i was rather keen on her i n those days and i fancy she liked me too but she was with us so short a time that n othing came of it while i was helping her to clim b on to a raft i let m y hand st ray over her breasts then she lay flat on the raft while i tr od water after a moment she turned and looked at me her hair was over her eyes and she was la ughing i clam bered up on to the raft b eside her the air was pleas antly warm and half joki ngly i let m y head sink back upon her l ap she didn’t seem to m ind so i let it stay there i had the sky full i n my eyes all blue and gol d and i c ould feel marie’s stomach rising and falli ng gently under m y head we m ust have stay ed a good halfhour on the raft both of us half asleep when the sun got t oo hot she dived off and i foll owed i caught up wit h her put my arm round her wa ist and we swam side by side she was still laughing while we were drying oursel ves on t he edge of t he swimm ing pool she said “i’m browner t han you” i asked he r if she’d com e to the movies with me that evening she laughed again and said “yes” if i’d take her to the comedy everybody was talking about the one with fernandel in it when we had dressed she star ed at my b lack tie an d asked if i was in mourni ng i explained that m y mother had died “when ” she asked and i said “yesterday” she made no rem ark though i thought she shrank away a little i was just going to explain to her that it wasn’t m y fault but i checked mys elf as i remem bered having said the same thing to m y employer and realizing then it sounded rather fool ish still foolish or not somehow one can’t help feeling a bit guilty i suppose anyhow by evening marie had forgotten all about it the fil m was funny i n parts but som e of it was downright stupid she pr essed her leg against mine while we were in the picture house and i was fondl ing he r breast toward the end of the show i kissed her but rather clu msily afterwar d she came back with me to my place when i woke up marie had gone she’d told me h er aunt ex pected her first thing in the m orning i re mem bered it was a sunday and that put me o ff i’ve never cared for sunda ys so i turned m y head and lazily sniffed the sm ell of brine that marie’s head had left on the pillow i slept until ten after that i stayed in bed until noon smoking cigarettes i decided not to lunch at céleste’s restaurant as i usually did they’d be sure to pester m e with questions and i di slike being questioned so i fried some eggs and ate them off the pan i did without bread as there wasn’t any left and i couldn’t be bothered going down to buy it after lunch i felt at loose ends and roamed about the little flat it suited us well enough w hen mother was with m e but now th at i was by m yself it was too large and i’d m oved the dini ng table into m y bedroom that was now the only room i used it had all the furniture i needed a brass beds tead a dressing table so me cane ch airs whose seats had m ore or less caved in a wardrobe with a tarnished m irror the rest of the flat was nev er used so i didn’t trouble to look after it a bit later for want of anyt hing better t o do i pic ked up an old newspaper that was lying on the floor and read it there wa s an ad vertisement of kruschen salts and i cut it out and pasted in into an album wh ere i keep things th at amu se me in t he papers then i washed m y hands and as a last resource went out on to the balcony my bedroom overlooks the main street of our district though it was a fine afternoon the paving blocks were black and glisteni ng what few people were about seemed in an absurd hurry first of all there came a fam ily going for t heir sunda y afternoon walk two small boys in sailor suit s with shor t trousers hardly down to their knees and looking rather uneasy in their sunday best then a little girl with a big pink bow and black patentleather s hoes behind them was their mother an enorm ously fat wo man in a brown silk dr ess and their father a dapper little man whom i knew by sight he had a straw hat a walking stic k and a butterfly tie seeing him beside his wife i understood why peopl e said he came of a good fam ily and had married beneath him next came a group of young fellows the local “bloods” with sleek oiled hair red ties coats cut very tight at the waist braided pockets and s quaret oed shoes i guessed they were going to on e of the big theaters in the center of the town that was why they had started out so early and were hurrying to th e streetcar stop laughing and talking at the top of their voices after they had passed the street gradually emptied by this time all the matinees must have begun only a few shopkeep ers and cats rem ained about above the sycam ores bordering the road the sky was cloudless but the light was soft the tobacconist on the ot her side of the street brought a chair out on to the pavem ent in front of hi s door and sat astride it resting his arm s on the back the streetcars which a few m inutes before had been crowded we re now alm ost em pty in the little café chez pierrot beside the tobacconist’s th e waiter was sweeping up the sawdust in the empty restaurant a typical sunday afternoon i turned my chair round and seat ed myse lf like the tobacconist as it was more comfortable that way after sm oking a couple of cigarettes i went back to the room got a tablet of chocolate and returned t o the window to eat it soon after the sky clouded over and i thought a summer stor m was com ing however the clouds gradually lifted all the same they had left in the street a sort of threat of rain which made it darker i stayed watching the sky for quite a while at five there was a loud clanging of streetcars they were com ing from the stadium in our suburb where there had been a football match even the back platform s were crowded and people were standing on the steps then another streetcar b rought back the teams i knew th ey were the players by the little suitcase each m an carried they were bawling out their te am song “keep the ball rolli ng boys” one of them looked up at me an d shouted “we licked them ” i waved my hand and called back “good work” from now on there was a steady stream of private car s the sky had changed again a reddish glow was spreading up beyond the housetops as dusk set in the street grew more crowded people were returning from their walks and i noticed the dapper little man with the fat wife amongst the passers by children were whim pering and trail ing w earily after their parents after some minutes the local picture houses disgorge d their audiences i noticed that the young fellows com ing from them were taking longe r stri des and gesturing m ore vigorously than at ordinary times doubt less the picture they’d been seeing was of the wildwest variety those who had been t o the pictur e houses i n the m iddle of t he town came a little later and looked m ore sedate though a few were still laughing on the whole however they seemed languid and exhausted some of th em rem ained loitering in the street under m y window a group of girls came by walking arm in arm the young m en under m y window swerved so as to brush against them and shouted humorous rem arks which m ade the girls tu rn thei r heads and giggle i recognized them as gi rls from my part of the t own and two or t hree of them whom i knew looked up and waved to m e just then the street l amps came on all to gether an d they made the star s that wer e beginning to glimmer in the night sky pa ler still i felt m y eyes getting tired what with the lights and all the m ovement i’d b een watching in the street there were little pools of brightness under the lamps and now and t hen a streetcar passed lighting up a girl’s hair or a sm ile or a silver bangle soon after this as the str eetcars became fewer and the sky showed velvety black above the trees and lam ps the street grew emptier alm ost imperceptibly until a time came when there was nobody t o be seen and a cat the first of th e evening crossed unhurryi ng the deserted street it struck me that i’d better see about so me dinner i had been leaning so long on the back of m y chair looking down that my neck hurt when i straight ened m yself up i went down bought som e bread and sp aghetti did m y cooking and ate m y meal standing i’d intended to sm oke another ci garette at m y window but the night had turned rather chilly a nd i decided against it as i was com ing back after shutting the window i glanced at the mirror and saw reflect ed in it a corner of my table with my spirit lam p and som e bits of bread beside it it occurred to me that som ehow i’d got through another sunday that mother now was buried and tom orrow i’d be going back to work as usual really nothi ng in m y life had changed iii i had a busy m orning in the office my employer was in a good hum or he even inqui red if i wasn’t t oo tired and followe d it up by asking what mother’s age was i thought a bit then answered “round about sixt y” as i didn’t want to make a blunder at which he looke d relieved—why i can’t imag ine—and seemed to thi nk that closed the matter there was a pile of bills of la ding waiti ng on m y desk and i had to go through them all before leaving for lunch i washed my hands i always enjoyed doing this at midday in the evening it was less pleasant as the roller towel after being used by so many people was soppi ng wet i once brought this to m y employer’s notice it w as regrettable he agreed—but to his m ind a mere d etail i left the office building a little later than usual at h alfpast tw elve with emmanuel who works in th e forwarding department our building overl ooks the sea and we paused for a moment on the steps to look at the shippi ng in the harbor the sun was scorching hot just t hen a big truck came up with a din of chains and backfires from the engine and emmanuel suggested we should try to jump it i started to run the truck was well away and we had to chase it for qui te a distance w hat with the heat an d the noise from the engine i felt half dazed all i was conscious of was our mad rush along the water front am ongst cranes and winc hes with dark hulls of ships alongsi de and m asts swaying in the offing i was the first to catch up with the truck i took a flying jum p landed safely and helped emma nuel to scram ble in beside me we were both of us out of breath and the bum ps of the truck on the roughly laid cobbles made things worse emmanuel chuckled and pa nted in my ear “we’ ve made it ” by the time we reach ed célest e’s restaurant we were drippi ng with sweat céleste was at his usual place beside the entrance with his apron bulging on his paunch his white m ustache well to the fo re when h e saw me he wa s sym pathetic and “hoped i wasn’t feeling t oo badly” i said “no” but i was extrem ely hungry i ate very quickly and had some coffee to finish up then i went to my place and took a short nap as i’d drunk a gl ass of wine too m any when i woke i sm oked a cigarette before getting off m y bed i was a bit late and had to run for the street car th e office was s tifling and i was kept hard at it all the afternoon so it came as a relief when we closed down and i was stroll ing sl owly along the wharves in the cool ness the sky was green and it was pleasant to be out ofdoors a fter the stuffy office however i went straight hom e as i had to put som e potatoes on to boil the hall was dark and when i was starting up t he stairs i almost bum ped into old salamano who lived on the same floor as i as usual he had his dog with him for eight years the two had been inseparable salamano’s spaniel is an ugly brute afflicted with some skin disease—mange i suspect anyhow it has lost all its hair and its body is covered with brown scabs perhaps through li ving in one small room cooped up with his dog salama no has com e to resem ble it his towy hair has gone very thin and he has reddish blotches on his face and the dog has developed something of its m aster’s queer hunchedup gait it always has its m uzzle stretched far forward and its nose to the ground bu t oddly enough though so m uch alike they detest each other twice a day at elev en and six the ol d fellow takes his dog for a walk and for eight years that walk has never varied you can see them in the rue de lyon the dog pulling his master along as hard as he can till finally the old chap m isses a step and nearly falls then he beats his dog and calls it names the dog cow ers and lags behind and it’s his master’s turn to dra g him along presently the dog forgets st arts tuggi ng at the leash again gets another hi ding and m ore abuse th en they halt on the pavem ent the pair of them and glare at each other the dog with terror and the man with hatred in his eyes every time they’re out thi s happens when the dog wants to stop at a l amppost the old boy won’t le t him and drags hi m on and the wretched spaniel leaves behind him a trail of little drops but if he does it in the room it means another hiding it’s been going on li ke this for eight year s and céleste always says it’s a “crying sham e” and som ething should be done about it but really one can’t be sure when i met him in the hall salamano was bawling at his dog calling him a bastard a lousy mongrel and so fort h and the dog was whin ing i said “good evening” but the old fellow took no notic e and went on cursing so i thought i’d ask him what the dog had done again he didn’t answer but went on shouti ng “you bloody cur” and the rest of it i couldn’t see very clearly but he se emed to be fixing something on the dog’s collar i raised m y voice a little without lo oking round he m umbled in a sort of suppressed fury “he’s always in the way blast him ” then he started up the stai rs but the dog tried to resist and flattened itsel f out on the floor so he had to haul it up on the leas h step by step just t hen another m an who li ves on m y floor came in from the street the general idea hereabouts i s that he’s a pim p but if you ask him what his job i s he says he’s a warehouseman one thing’s sure he isn’t popu lar in our street still he often has a word for me and drops i n sometimes for a short talk in m y room because i listen to him as a m atter of fact i find what he says quite interesting so really i’ve no reason for freezing him off his name is sintès ray mond sintès he’s short and thickset has a nose like a boxer’s and alwa ys dresses very sprucely he too once said to m e referring to salamano that it was “a damn ed shame” and asked me if i wasn’t disgusted by the way the old m an served his dog i answered “no” we went up the stairs together sintès and i and when i was turning i n at m y door he said “look here how about havi ng som e grub wit h me i’ve a black puddi ng and some wine” it struck me that this would sa ve m y having to cook m y dinner so i said “thanks very mu ch” he too has only one room and a little kitchen without a window i saw a pink andwhite plaster angel above his bed and som e photos of sporti ng cham pions and naked girl s pinned t o the opposite wall th e bed hadn’t been m ade and the room was dirty he began by lighting a paraffin lam p then fum bled in his pocket and produced a rather grim y bandage which he wrapped round hi s right hand i asked him what the trouble was he told m e he’d been having a roughhouse w ith a fellow who’d annoyed him “i’m not one who looks for trouble” he e xplained “onl y i’m a bit shorttem pered that fellow said to me challenginglike ‘c ome d own off that streetcar if you’re a man’ i says ‘you keep quiet i ain’t done nothi ng to you’ then he said i hadn’t any guts well that settled it i got down off the streetcar and i said to him ‘you better keep your m outh shut or i’ll shut it for you’ ‘i’d l ike to see you try’ says he then i gave him one across the face and laid him out good and pr oper after a bit i started to help hi m get up but all he did was to ki ck at me from wh ere he lay so i gave him one with m y knee and a couple m ore swip es he was bleeding like a pig when i’d done with him i asked him if he’d had enough and he said ‘yes’ ” sintès was busy fixing his bandage while he talked and i wa s sitting on the bed “so you see” he said “it wasn’t m y fault he was asking for it wasn’t he” i nodded and he added “as a matter of fact i rather want to ask your advice about som ething it ’s connected with this business you’ve knoc ked about the world a bit and i daresay you can help m e and then i’l l be your pal for life i never forg et anyone who does me a good turn” when i made no comment he asked me if i’d like us to be pals i replie d that i had no objection and that appeared to satisfy him he got out t he black pudding cooked it in a frying pan then laid the table putting out two bottles of wine while he was doing this he didn’t speak we started dinner and then he began telling me the whole story hesitating a bit at first “there’s a girl behi nd it—as usual we slept together pretty regular i was keeping her as a matter of fact and she cost me a tidy sum that fellow i knocked down is her brothe r” noticing that i said nothi ng he added th at he knew what the neighbors said about him but it was a filthy lie he had his pr inciples like everybody else and a job in a warehouse “well” he said “to go on with m y story i found out one day that she was letting me down” he gave her enough m oney to keep her goi ng without extravagance though he paid the rent of her room and twenty francs a day for food “three hundred francs for rent and six hundred for he r grub with a little present thrown in now and t hen a pair of stocki ngs or wh atnot say a thousand francs a m onth but that wasn’t enough for m y fine lady she was always grum bling that she couldn’t make both ends meet with what i gave her so one day i says t o her ‘look here why not get a job for a few hours a day that’d make things easier for m e too i bought you a new dress this m onth i pay your rent and gi ve you twenty francs a day but you go and waste your m oney at the café with a pack of girl s you give them coffee and sugar and of course the m oney comes out of m y pocket i treat you on t he square and that’s how you pay me back’ bu t she wouldn’t hear of working though she kept on saying she couldn’t make do with what i gave her and then one day i found out she was doing m e dirt” he went on to explain that he’d found a lottery t icket in her bag and when he asked where the m oney’d com e from to buy it she wouldn’t t ell him then another time h e’d found a pawn ticket f or two bracel ets that he’d never set ey es on “so i kne w there was dirty w ork going on and i told her i’d ha ve nothing m ore to do with her but first i gave her a good hiding and i t old her som e home truths i said that there was only one thing interest ed her and that was getting into bed with men whenever she’d the ch ance and i warned her straight ‘you’ll be sorry one day my girl and wish you’d got me back all th e girls in the street they ’re jealous of your luck i n having me to keep you’ ” he’d beaten her till the blood came before th at he’d never beaten her “well not hard anyhow onl y affectionatelylike sh e’d howl a bit and i had to shut t he window then of course it ended as per us ual but this time i’m done with her only to my m ind i ain’t punish ed her enough s ee what i mean” he explained that it was a bout this he wanted m y advice the lam p was sm oking and he stopped pacing up and down the room to lower the wick i just listened without speaking i’d had a whole bottle of wine to myself and my head was buzzing as i’d used up m y cigarettes i was sm oking raym ond’s some late streetcars passed and the last noi ses of the st reet died of f with them raym ond went on ta lking w hat bored him was that he had “a sort of lech on her” as he called it but he was quite deter mined to teach her a l esson his first i dea he said had been to take her to a hotel and then call in the special police he’d persuade them to put her on the register as a “co mmon prostitute” and that would make her wild then he’d looked up som e friends of his in the underworl d fellows who kept tarts for what they could m ake out of them but they had practically nothing to sugges t still as he pointed out that sort of thing should have been right up t heir street what’s t he good of being i n that line if you don’t know how to treat a girl who’s let you down when he told them that they suggested he shoul d “brand” her but that wasn’t what he wanted either it would need a lot of thinking out but first he’d like to ask me somet hing before he asked it though he’d like to have m y opinion of the stor y he’d been telling in a general way i said i hadn’t any but i’d found it interesting did i think she really had done him dirt i had to adm it it looked like that then he asked me if i didn’t t hink she shoul d be punished and what i’d do if i were in his s hoes i told him one could never be quite sure how to act in su ch cases b ut i quite understood his wanting her to suffer for it i drank some m ore wine while ray mond lit another ciga rette and began explaining what he proposed t o do he want ed to write her a lette r “a real stinker that’ll get her on the raw” and at the same time make her repent of what she’d done then when she came back he’d go to bed w ith her and just when she was “properly primed up” he’d spit in he r face and throw her out of th e room i agreed it wasn’t a bad plan it would punish her all right but raym ond told me he didn’t feel up to writ ing the ki nd of lette r that was needed and that was where i could help wh en i di dn’t say a nythi ng he asked me if i’d m ind doing it ri ght away and i said “no” i’d have a shot at it he drank off a glass of wine and st ood up then he pushed aside the plates and the bit of cold pudding t hat was left to m ake room on the table after carefully wipi ng the oilcloth he got a sheet of squared pa per from the drawer of his bedside table after that an envelope a small red woode n penholder and a square inkpot wit h purple ink in it the m oment he mentione d the girl’s nam e i knew she was a moor i wrote the letter i didn’t take m uch tr ouble over it but i wanted to satisfy raym ond as i’d no reason not to satisfy hi m then i read out what i’d written puffing at his cigarette he listened nodding now and then “read it agai n please” he said he seemed delighted “that’s the stuff” he chuc kled “i could t ell you was a brainy sort old boy and you know what’s what” at first i hardly not iced that “ol d boy” it came back to me wh en he slapped me on the shoulder and said “so now we’re pals ai n’t we” i kept silence and he said it again i didn’t care one way or the other but as he seemed so set on it i nodded and said “yes” he put the letter into the envelope and we finished off the wine then both of us smoked for som e minutes without speaking the street was quite quiet except when now and again a car passed finally i remarked that it was getting late an d raym ond agreed “time’s gone m ighty fast th is evening” he added and in a way that was true i wanted to be in bed only it was such an effort making a m ove i must have looked tired for raym ond said to me “you m ustn’t let things get you down” at first i didn’t catch his m eaning then he explained that he had heard of my mother’s death anyhow he said that wa s something bound to happen one day or another i appreciated that and told him so when i rose raym ond shook hands very warm ly remarking t hat men always understood each other after closing th e door behind m e i lingered for some moments on the landing the whole buil ding wa s as quiet as the grave a dank dark smell risi ng from the well hole of t he stai rs i could hear not hing but t he blood throbbing in m y ears and for a while i st ood still listening to it then the dog began to m oan in old salamano’s room and through the sleepbound house the little plaintive sound rose slowly like a fl ower growing out of the si lence and the darkness iv i had a busy tim e in the office throughout the week ray mond dropped in once to tell m e he’d sent off the le tter i went to the pictures twice with emmanuel who doesn’t al ways understand what ’s happening on the screen a nd asks me to explain it yesterday was satu rday and marie came as we’d arranged she had a very pretty dress with red and white stri pes and leather sandals and i couldn’t take m y eyes off her one could see the outline of her fi rm little breasts and her suntanned face was like a velvety brow n flower we took the bus and went to a beach i know some miles out of algiers it’s j ust a strip of sand between two rocky spurs with a line of rushes at the back along the tide line at four o’cloc k the sun wasn’t too hot but t he water was pleasantly tepid and small languid ri pples were creeping up t he sand marie taught m e a new game the idea was while one swam to suck in the spray off the waves and when one’s m outh was full of foam to lie on one’s back and spout it out against the sky it made a sort of fro thy haze that melted into the air or fell back in a war m shower on one’s cheeks but ve ry soon m y mouth was smarting with all the salt i’d drawn in then marie came up and hugged m e in the water and pressed her m outh to m ine her tongue cooled m y lips and we let the wa ves roll us about for a minute or two before swi mming back to the beach when we had finished dressing mari e looked hard at me her eyes were sparkling i kissed her after that neither of us spoke for quite a while i pressed her to my side as we scram bled up th e foreshore both of us were in a hurry to catch th e bus get back to m y place and tum ble on t o the bed i’d left m y window open and it was pleasant to feel the cool night air flowing over our sunburned bodies marie said she was free next m orning so i proposed she should have luncheon with me she agreed and i went down to buy som e meat on m y way back i heard a wom an’s voice in raym ond’s room a little la ter old salamano started grum bling at his dog and presently there was a sound of boot s and paws on the wooden stairs then “fil thy brute get on yo u cur” and the two of them went out into the street i told marie about the old m an’s habits and it made her laugh she was wearing one of my pajama suits and had t he sleeves ro lled up when she laughed i wanted her again a m oment later she asked m e if i love d her i said that so rt of question had no meaning really but i supposed i didn’t sh e looked sad for a bit but when we were getting our lunch ready she bri ghtened up and start ed laughing and when she laughs i always want to kiss her it was just th en that the row started i n raymond’s room first we heard a woman saying som ething in a highpitched voi ce then ray mond bawling at her “you let me down you bitch i’ll learn you to let me down” there came some thuds then a piercing scream —it made one’s bl ood run col d—and in a moment there was a crowd of people on the la nding marie and i went out to see the wom an was still scream ing and raymond s till knocking her about marie said wasn’t it horri ble i didn’t answer anything then she asked me to go and fetch a policem an but i told her i didn’t like police men however one tu rned up presently the lodger on the second floor a plum ber came up with him when he banged on the door t he noise st opped insi de the room he knocked again and after a m oment the wom an started crying and raym ond opened the door he had a cigarette dangling from his underlip and a rather sickly sm ile “your na me” raym ond gave his name “tak e that cigarette out of your m outh when you’re talking to me” the policeman said gruffly raym ond hesitated glanced at me and kept the cigare tte in his m outh the policeman prom ptly swung his arm and gave him a good hard smack on the left cheek the cigarette shot from his lips and dropped a yard away ray mond m ade a wr y face but said nothing for a m oment then in a hum ble tone he asked if he m ightn’t pick up his cigarette the officer said “y es” and added “but don’t you forget next time that we don’t stand for any nonsense not from guys like you” meanwhile the girl went on sobbing and re peating “he hit me the coward he’s a pimp” “excuse me officer” raym ond put in “but is that in order calling a man a pimp in the presence of wi tnesses” the policeman told him to shut his trap raym ond then turne d to the girl “don’t you worry m y pet we’ll m eet again” “that’s enough” the policeman said and told the girl to go away raym ond was to stay in his room till summ oned to the po lice station “you ought to be ashamed of yourself” the policeman added “getting so tight you can’t stand steady why you’re shaking all over” “i’m not tight” raym ond explained “only when i see you standing t here and looki ng at me i can’t help trembling that’s onl y natural” then he closed his door and we all went away marie and i finished getting our lunch ready but she hadn’t any appetite and i ate n early all she left at on e and then i had a nap toward three there was a knock at m y door and raym ond came in he sat down on the edge of m y bed and for a m inute or two said nothi ng i asked him how it had gone off he said it had all gone quite sm oothly at fi rst as per progra m only then she’d slapped his face and he’d seen red and started thrashing her as for what happened after that he needn’ t tell me as i was there “well” i said “you t aught her a lesson a ll right and that’s what you wanted isn’t it” he agreed and pointed out that whatever the police did that wouldn’t change th e fact she’d had her punishm ent as for the police he knew exactly how to handle them but he’d like to know if i’d expected him to return the blow when the policem an hit him i told him i hadn’t e xpected anythi ng w hatsoever and anyhow i had no use for the police raym ond seemed pleased and asked if i’d li ke to com e out for a strol l with him i got up from the bed and start ed brushing m y hair then raym ond said that what he really wanted was for me to act as his witness i told him i had no objection only i di dn’t know what he expected me to say “it’s quite sim ple” he rep lied “you’ve only got t o tell them that the girl had let me down” so i agreed to be his witness we went out together a nd raym ond stood me a brandy in a café then we had a game of billiards it was a close game an d i lost by only a few points after that he proposed going to a brot hel but i refused i didn’t feel like it as we were walk ing slowly back he tol d me how pleased he was at having paid out his m istress so satisfactorily he made him self extremely amiable to m e and i quite enjoyed our walk when we were nearly hom e i saw old sal amano on the doorst ep he seemed very excited i noticed that his dog wasn’t w ith him he was turning like a teetotum looki ng in all directions and sometimes peer ing into the darkness of the hall with his little bloodshot eyes then he’d m utter something to him self and start gazing up and down the street ag ain raym ond asked him what was wrong but he didn’t answer at once then i heard him grunt “the bastard the filthy cur” when i a sked him where his dog was he scowled at me and snapped out “gone” a m oment late r all of a sudden he launched out into it “i’d taken him to the parade ground as us ual there was a fair on and you coul d hardly m ove for the crowd i stopped at one of t he booths t o look at t he handcuff king when i turned to go the dog was gone i’d been meaning to get a sm aller collar but i never thought the brute coul d slip it and get away like that” raym ond assured hi m the dog would find its way hom e and told him stories of dogs that had traveled m iles and m iles to ge t back to their m asters but this seemed to make th e old fellow ev en more worried than before “don’t you understa nd they’ll do away with him the police i mean it’s not likely anyone will take him in and look after him with all those scabs he puts everybody off” i told him that there was a pound at t he poli ce station where stray dogs are taken his dog was certain to be t here and he could get it back on paym ent of a small charge he asked me how m uch the char ge was but there i couldn’t he lp him then he flew int o a rage ag ain “is it likely i’d give m oney for a m utt lik e that no dam ned fear they can kill him for all i care” and he went on calling his dog the usual nam es raym ond gave a laugh and turned into t he hall i followed him upstairs and we parted on the landing a m inute or two later i heard salam ano’s footsteps and a knock on m y door when i opened it he halted fo r a m oment in the doorway “excuse me i hope i’m not disturbing you” i asked him in but he shook his head he was staring at his toe caps and the gnarled ol d hands were trem bling withou t meeting m y eyes he started talking “they won’t really t ake hi m from me will they monsieur meursault surely the y wouldn’t do a thing like that if they do— i don’t know what wi ll becom e of me” i told him that so far as i knew they kept stray dogs in the pound for three days waiting for their owners to call for them afte r that they disposed of the dogs as they thought fit he stared at me in si lence for a m oment then said “good eve ning” aft er that i heard him pacing up and down his room for quite a while then his bed creaked through the wall there came to me a little wh eezing sound and i gue ssed that he was weeping for som e reason i don’t know wh at i began thi nking of mot her but i had to get up early next day so as i wasn’t feeling hungry i did without supper and went straight to bed v raym ond rang me up at the office he said that a friend of his—t o whom he’d spoken about m e—invited m e to spend ne xt sunday at his little seaside bungalow just outside algiers i told him i’d have been delighted only i had prom ised to spend sunday wi th a girl raym ond prom ptly replied that she could com e too in fact his friend’s wi fe would be very pleased not to be the only wom an in a party of m en i’d have li ked to hang up at once as m y employer doesn’t approve of m y using t he office phone for private calls but raymond asked me to hold on he had something else to tell m e and that was why he’d rung me up though he could have waited till the evening to pass on the invit ation “it’s like this” he said “i’ve been sh adowed all the m orning by som e arabs on e of them ’s the brother of that girl i had the row with if you see him hanging round the house when you come back pass me the word” i prom ised to do so just then m y employer sent for m e for a mo ment i felt uneasy as i expected h e was going to tell me to stick to m y work and not waste tim e chattering with friends over the phone however it was nothing of the kind he wanted to discuss a project he had in view though so far he’d com e to no decision it was to open a branch at paris so as to be able to deal with the big com panies on the spot wit hout posta l delays and he wanted to know if i’d like a post there “you’re a young m an” he said “and i’m pretty sure you’ d enjoy li ving in paris and of course you could travel about france for some months in the year” i told him i was quit e prepared to go but really i di dn’t care m uch one way or the other he then asked if a “change of life” as he called it didn’t appeal to m e and i answered that one ne ver changed hi s way of life one life was as good as another and my present one suited me quite well at this he looked rather hurt and told me that i always shillyshallied and that i lacked ambition—a grave defect to hi s mind when one was in business i returned to m y work i’d have preferre d not to vex him but i saw no reason for “changing m y life” by and large it wasn’t an unpl easant one as a student i’d had plenty of am bition of the ki nd he meant bu t when i had t o drop m y studies i ve ry soon realized all that was pretty futile marie came that evening and asked me if i’d marry her i said i didn’t mind if she was keen on it we’d get married then she asked m e again if i loved her i replied much as before that her question meant nothing or next to not hing—but i supposed i didn’t “if that’s how you feel” she said “why marry me” i explained that i t had no im portance really but i f it would give her pl easure we could get married right away i poi nted out that anyhow the suggesti on cam e from her as for me i’d m erely said “yes” then she r emarked that marriage was a serious matter to which i answered “no” she kept silent after that staring at me in a curious way then she asked “suppose another gi rl had asked you to ma rry her—i m ean a girl you liked in the same way as you like m e—would you ha ve said ‘yes’ to her too” “naturally” then she said she wondered if she really loved m e or not i of course couldn’t enlighten her as to that and after anot her silence she m urmured something about my being “a queer fellow” “and i daresay that’s why i love you” she added “but maybe that’s why one day i’ll come to hate you” to which i had nothi ng to say so i said nothing she thought for a bi t then started sm iling and taking m y arm repeated that she was in earnest she really wanted to m arry me “all right” i answered “we’ll get m arried whenever you like ” i then mentioned the proposal made by m y employer and marie said she’d love to go to paris when i told her i’d lived in paris for a while she asked me wh at it was lik e “a dingy sort of town to m y mind ma sses of pigeons and dark court yards and the people have washedout white faces” then we went for a walk all the way ac ross the town by the main streets the wom en were goodl ookers and i asked marie if she too noticed this she said “yes” and that she saw what i meant af ter that we said not hing for some m inutes however as i di dn’t want her to leave me i suggested we should dine together at céleste’s she’d have loved to dine w ith me she said only she was booked up for the evening we wer e near my place and i said “ au revoir then” she looked me in the eyes “don’t you want to know what i’m doing this evening” i did want to know but i hadn’t though t of asking her and i guessed she was making a grievance of it i must have looked em barrassed for suddenl y she started laughing a nd bent toward me pouti ng her lips for a kiss i went by m yself to céleste’s when i ha d just start ed my dinner an oddlooking little woman came in and asked if she m ight s it at my table of course she m ight she had a chubby face lik e a ripe appl e bright eyes and m oved in a curiously jerky way as if she were on wires after taking o ff her closefitting jacket she sat down an d started studying the bill of fare with a sort of rapt attention then she called céleste and gave her order very fast but quite distinctly one didn’t lose a word while waiting for the hors d’oeuvre she opened her bag took out a slip of paper and a pencil and added up the bill in advance diving into her bag again she produced a purse and took from it the exact sum plus a small tip and pla ced it on t he cloth in front of her just then the waiter brought the hors d’oe uvre which she proceeded to wolf down voraciousl y while waiting for the next cour se she produced another pencil this time a blue one from her ba g and the radio mag azine for the co ming week an d started making ticks against alm ost all the items of the daily program s there were a dozen pages in the magazine and she c ontinued studyi ng them closely throughout the meal when i’d finished m ine she wa s still ticking off item s with the same meticulous attention then she rose put on her jacket again with the same abrupt robot like gestures and walked briskl y out of the restaurant having nothing better to do i followed her for a short distance keeping on the curb of the pavement she walked straig ht ahead never swerving or l ooking ba ck and it was extraordinary how fast she cove red the ground considering her sm allness in fact the pace was too m uch for m e and i soon lost sight of her and turned back homeward for a m oment the “little robot” as i thought of he r had m uch im pressed me but i soon forgot about her as i was turning in at m y door i ran into old salamano i asked him into m y room and he inform ed me that his dog was defi nitely lost he’d been to the pound to inqui re but it wasn’t there and the sta ff told hi m it had probabl y been run over when he asked them whether it was any use inquiring about it at the police station they said the police had m ore im portant thin gs to attend to than keeping records of stray dogs run over in t he streets i su ggested he shoul d ge t another dog but reasonably enough he pointed out t hat he ’d becom e used t o this one and it woul dn’t be the same thing i was seated on m y bed with m y legs up and salamano on a chair beside the table facing m e his hands spread on his knees he had kept on his battered felt hat and was mum bling away behind his draggled yellowish m ustache i found him rather boring but i had not hing to do and didn’t feel sleepy so to keep the conversation going i asked som e questions about his dog— how long he had had it and so fort h he told me he had g ot it soon after his wife’s death he’d m arried rather late in life when a young m an he wanted to go on th e stage during his m ilitary service he’d often played in the regim ental theatricals and acted rather well so everybody sai d however finally he had taken a job in the railway and he didn’t regret it as now he had a sm all pension he and his wife had never hi t it off very well but they’d got used to each other and when she died he felt lonely one of his mates on the railway whose bit ch had just had pups had offe red him one and he had taken it as a companion he’d had to feed it from the bottle at first but as a dog’s life is shorter than a man’s they’d grown old together so to speak “he was a cantankerous brut e” salama no said “now and then we had some proper settos he and i but he was a good m utt all the same” i said he looked well bred and that evidently pleased the old man “ah but you should have seen him before his illness” he said “he had a wonderful coat in fact that was his best point really i tried hard to cure him every mortal night after he got that skin dise ase i rubbed an oint ment in but his real trouble was old age and there’s no curing that” just t hen i yawned and the ol d man said he’d bet ter make a m ove i told him he could stay and that i was sorry about what had happened to his dog he thanked m e and mentioned that m y mother had been very fond of hi s dog he referred to her as “your poor m other” and was afraid i m ust be feeling her death terribl y when i said nothing he added hastily and with a rather em barrassed ai r that some of the people in the street said nasty things about me becau se i’d sent m y mother to the ho me but he of course knew better he knew how devoted to m y mother i had always been i answered—why i still don’t know—that it surprised me to l earn i’d produced such a bad im pression as i couldn’t afford to keep her here it seemed the obvi ous thing to do to send her to a home “in any case” i added “for years she’d never had a word to say to m e and i could see sh e was m oping with no one to talk to” “yes” he said “and at a hom e one m akes friends anyhow” he got up saying it was high time for him to be in bed and added that life was going to be a bit of a problem for him under the new conditions for the first time since i’d known hi m he held out his ha nd to m e—rather shyl y i thought—and i could feel the scales on his ski n just as he was goi ng out of t he door he turned a nd smiling a little said “let’s hope the dogs won’t bark again toni ght i always think it’ s mine i hear ” vi it was an effort waking up t hat sunday mo rning m arie had to jog m y shoulders and shout my nam e as we wanted to get i nto the water early we didn’t trouble about breakfast my head was aching slightly and m y first cigarette had a bitter taste marie told me i l ooked l ike a m ourner at a funera l and i certainly did feel very lim p she was wearing a white dress and had he r hair loose i told her she looked qui te ravishing like that and she laughed happily on our way out we banged on raym ond’s door and he shout ed that he’d be with us in a jiffy we went down to the street and because of my being rather under the weather and our having kept the blind down in m y room the gl are of the mor ning sun hit m e in the eyes like a clenched fist marie however was alm ost dancing with delight and kept repeating “what a heavenly day” after a few minutes i was feeling better and notic ed that i was hungry i mentioned this to m arie but sh e paid no attention she was carrying an oilcloth ba g in which she had stowed our ba thing ki t and a towel presently we heard raym ond shutti ng his door he was wearing blue trousers a shortsle eved white shirt and a straw hat i noticed that his fo rearm s were rather hairy but the skin was very white beneath the straw hat made mari e giggle personally i was rather put off by his getup he seemed in high spirits a nd was whistling as he came down the stairs he greeted m e with “hello old boy” a nd addressed marie as “madem oiselle” on the previous evening we had visited th e police station wher e i gav e evidence for raym ond—about the girl’s having been fals e to him so they let him off with a warning they didn’t check m y statement after some talk on the doorste p we decide d to take the bus th e beach was within easy walking distanc e but the sooner we got th ere the better just as we were starting for the bus stop raym ond plucked m y sleeve and told me to look across the street i saw some arabs lounging against the tobacc onist’s window they were staring at us silently in the special way these people have —as if we were blocks of stone or dead trees raym ond whispered that the second arab from the le ft was “his m an” and i thought he looked ra ther worri ed however he assured me that all that was ancient history marie who hadn’t fol lowed his remarks asked “what is it” i explained that those arabs across th e way had a grudge against raym ond she insisted on our going at once then raym ond laughed and squared his shoulde rs the young lady was quite right he said there was no poi nt in hanging about here halfway to the bus stop he glanced b ack over his shoul der and said the arabs weren’t following i too looked back they wer e exactly as before gazing in the same vague way at the spot where we had been when we were in the bus raym ond who now seemed quite at ease kept making jokes to am use marie i could see he was a ttracted by her but she had hardly a word for him now and again she wo uld catch my eye an d smile we alighted just outside algiers the b each is not far from the bus stop one has only to cross a patch of highl and a sort of plateau which ove rlooks the sea and shelves down steeply to the sands the ground here was cove red with yellowi sh pebbles and wild lil ies that showed snoww hite against the blue of t he sky which had alread y the hard m etallic glint it gets on very hot days marie amused herself swishing her bag a gainst t he flowers a nd sendi ng the petals show ering i n all directions then we walked between two ro ws of lit tle houses w ith wooden balconies and green or white palings some of them we re half hidden i n clum ps of tamarisks others rose naked from the stony plateau befo re we came to the end of it the sea was in full view it lay sm ooth as a m irror and in the distance a big headland jutt ed out over its black reflection through the still air came the faint buzz of a m otor engine and we saw a fishi ng boat very far out gl iding alm ost im perceptibly across the dazzling sm oothness marie picked some rock iris es going down the steep path leading to the sea we saw some bathers already on the sands raym ond’s friend owned a sm all wooden bungalow at the near end of the beach its back rested against the cliffside while the front stood on piles which the water was already lapping raym ond in troduced us to his friend whose nam e was masson he was tall broads houldered and thick set his wife was a plum p cheerful little woman who spoke with a pari s accent masson prom ptly told us to make ourselves at home he had gone out fishing he said first thing in the m orning and th ere would be fried fish for lunch i congratulated him on his little bungalow and he said he always spent his week ends and holi days here “with the m issus needless to say” he ad ded i glanced at her and noticed that she and marie seemed to be getting on well together laughing and chattering away for the first time perhaps i seriously co nsidered the possibility of my marrying her masson wanted to have a swim at once but his wife and raym ond were disincline d to m ove so only the three of us marie masson and m yself went down to the beach marie prom ptly plunged in but masson and i waited for a bit he was rather slow of speech and ha d i notic ed a habit of saying “and what’s m ore” between hi s phrases—even when the second ad ded not hing re ally to the first talki ng of marie he said “she’s an awfully pretty girl and what’s mo re ch arming” but i soon ceas ed paying attention to this trick of his i was baski ng in the sunli ght which i noticed was m aking me feel much better the sand was beginning to stoke up underfoot and though i was eager for a dip i post poned i t for a m inute or two m ore at last i said to masson “shall we go in now ” and plunged masson walked in gingerly and only began to swi m when he was out of hi s dept h he swam hand over hand and made slow headway so i left him behind and caught up wit h marie the water was cold and i felt all the better for it we swam a long way out marie and i side by side and it was pleasant feeling how our m ovements matched hers and m ine and how we were both in the same m ood enjoying every m oment once we were out in the open we lay o n our backs and as i gazed up at the sky i could feel the sun drawing up t he film of salt water on m y lips and cheeks we saw masson swi m back to the beach and slum p down on the sand under the sun in the distance he looked enorm ous like a strande d whale then marie proposed that we shoul d swim tandem she we nt ahead and i put m y arms round her waist from behind and while she drew me forward with her arm stroke s i kicked out behi nd to help us on that sound of little splashes had been in m y ears for so long that i began to feel i’d had enough of it so i let go of marie and swam back at an easy pace taking long deep breaths when i made the beach i stretched m yself be lly dow nward beside masson resting m y face on the sand i told him “it was fine” here and he agreed presently marie came back i raised m y head to watch her approach she was glistening with brine and holdi ng her hair back then she lay down beside m e and what with the co mbined war mth of our bodi es and the sun i felt myself dropping off to sleep after a while marie tugged my ar m and said masson had gone to his place it must be nearly luncht ime i rose at once as i was feeling hungry but marie told m e i hadn’t kissed her once since the early m orning that was so—though i’d wanted to several times “let’s go into the wat er agai n” she said and we ran into the sea and lay flat am ongst the ripples for a m oment then we swam a few strokes and when we were alm ost out of our depth she flung her arm s round m e and hugged me i felt her legs twining round m ine and m y senses tingled when we got back masson was on the st eps of hi s bungalow shouting to us to come i told him i was raven ously hungry and he prom ptly turned t o his wife and said he’d t aken quite a fancy to m e the bread was excellent and i had my full share of the fish then came som e steak and potat o chips none of us spoke while eating masson drank a lot of wine and kept refill ing m y glass the m oment it was em pty by the tim e coffee was handed round i was feeli ng slightly m uzzy and i started sm oking one cigarette after another masson raymond and i discu ssed a plan of spending t he whole of august on the beach together sharing expenses suddenl y marie exclaim ed “i say do you know the tim e it’s onl y halfpast eleven” we were all surprised at that and mass on remark ed that we’d had a very early lunch but really lunch was a movable feast you had it when you felt like it this set marie laughing i don’t know why i suspect she’d drunk a bit too m uch then m asson asked if i’d like to co me with him for a stroll on the beach “my wife always has a nap after lunch” he said “personally i find i t doesn’t agree with m e what i need is a short walk i’ m always telling her it’ s much better for the health bu t of course she’ s entitled to her own opinion” marie proposed to stay and help with the washing up mme masson sm iled and said that in that case the first thing was to get the men out of the way so we went out together the three of us the light was alm ost vertical and the gl are from the water s eared one’s eyes th e beach was quite deserted now one could h ear a fai nt tinkle of knives and forks and crockery in the shacks and bungalows lining the foreshore heat was wel ling up from the rocks and one could hardly breathe at first raym ond and masson talked of things and peopl e i didn’t know i gathered that they’d been acqu ainted for some time and ha d even lived together for a while we went down to the water’s edge and walked along it now and then a longer wave wet our canvas shoes i wasn’t thinking of anyt hing as al l that sunli ght beating down on m y bare head made me f eel h alf asleep just t hen raym ond said som ething to m asson that i didn’t quite catch but at the same moment i noticed two arabs in bl ue dungarees a long way down the beach coming in our direction i gave raym ond a look and he nodded saying “that’s him” we walked st eadily on masson wonde red how they’d m anaged to track us here my im pression was that they had seen us taking the bus and noticed marie’s oilcloth ba thing bag but i didn’t say anything though t he arabs walked quit e slowly they were m uch nearer already we didn’t change our pace but raym ond said “listen if there’s a roughhouse you ma sson take on the second one i’ll tackle the fellow who’s after me a nd you meursault stand by to help i f another one comes up and lay him out” i said “right” and masson put his hands in his pockets the sand was as hot as fire and i coul d have sworn it was glowing red the distance between us and the arabs was st eadily decreasing when we were only a few steps away the arabs halted masson and i slowed down while raym ond went straight up to hi s man i couldn’t hear wh at he said but i saw the native lowering hi s head as if to but t him in the chest ray mond lashed out prom ptly and shouted t o masson to come masson went up to the ma n he had been marking and struck hi m twice with all his m ight the fellow fell flat into the water and stayed there so me seconds with bubble s com ing up to the surface round his head mean while ray mond had been sloggi ng the other man whose face was stream ing with blood he glanced at me over his shoul der and shouted “just you watch i ain’t fini shed with him yet” “look out ” i cried “he’s got a knife” i spoke too late the m an had gashed raym ond’s arm and his m outh as well masson sprang forward the other arab got up from the water and placed him self behind the fellow with the kni fe we didn’t dare to m ove the two natives backed away slowly keeping us at bay with the knife and never taking their eyes off us when they were at a safe distance they swung round and took t o thei r heels we stood stoc kstil l with the sunl ight b eating down on us bl ood was dripping from raymond’s wounded ar m which he wa s squeezing hard above the elbow masson remarked th at there was a doctor who always spent his sundays here and raym ond said “good let’s go to him at on ce” he could hardly get the words out as the blood from his other wound made bubbles in his m outh we each gave hi m an ar m and helped him back to the bungalow on ce we were there he told us the wounds weren’t so ve ry deep and he could walk to where the doctor was marie had gone qui te pa le and mme masson was in tears masson and raym ond went off to the docto r’s while i was le ft behind at the bungalow to explain m atters to the women i didn’t m uch relish the task and soon dried up and started sm oking staring at the sea raym ond came back at about halfpast on e accompanied by masson he had his arm bandaged and a strip of sti cking plaste r on the corner of his m outh the doctor had assured him it was nothing serious but he was looki ng ve ry glum masson tri ed to make hi m laugh b ut without success presently raym ond said he was going for a stroll on th e beach i asked him where he proposed to go and he m umbled som ething about “wanting to take the air” we— masson and i—then said we’d go with him but he flew into a rage and told us to mind our own business masson said we m ustn’t insist seeing the state he was in however when he went out i followed him it was like a furnace outside with the sunlight splintering into fl akes of fire on the sand and sea we walked for quite a wh ile and i had an idea that raym ond had a definite idea where he was going but probably i was m istaken about this at the end of the beach we came to a s mall stream that had cut a ch annel in the sand after com ing out from behind a biggis h rock there we found our two arabs again lying on the sand in t heir blue dun garees they looked ha rmless enough as if they di dn’t bear any malice and neit her made any m ove when we approached the man who had slashed raym ond stared at hi m without speaki ng the other man was blowing down a little reed and extracting fro m it three notes of the scale which h e played over and over again while he wa tched us from the corner of an ey e for a while nobody m oved it was all sunlight and silence except for the tinkle of the stream and those three little lonely sounds then raym ond put his hand to his revolver pocket but the arabs still didn’t move i noticed the m an playing on the reed had his big toes splayed out alm ost at right angl es to his feet still keeping his eyes on his man ray mond said to me “shall i plug him one” i thought quickly if i tol d him not to c onsidering the m ood he was in he m ight very well fly into a tem per and use his gun so i said the first thing that came into m y head “he hasn’t spoken to you yet it would be a lowdown trick t o shoot him like that in cold blood” again for some m oments one heard nothi ng but t he tinkle of the stream and the flute notes weaving through the hot still air “well” raym ond said at last “if that’s how you feel i’d better say something insult ing and if he answers back i’ll loose off” “right” i said “only if he doesn’t ge t out his kni fe you’ve no business to fire” raym ond was beginning t o fidget the arab with the reed went on playing and both of t hem watched all our m ovem ents “listen” i said t o raymond “you take on t he fell ow on the right and give me your revol ver if the other one starts making trouble or gets out his knife i’ll shoot” the sun gl inted on raym ond’s revolver as he handed it t o me but nobody m ade a move yet it was just as if everything had clos ed in on us so that we couldn’t sti r we could only watch each othe r never lowering our eyes the whole world seemed to have co me to a standstill on this little strip of sand between the sunlight and the sea the twofold silence of the reed and stream and just then it crossed m y mind that one might fire or not fire —and it would com e to absolut ely the same thing then all of a sudde n the arabs vanishe d they’d slipped li ke lizards under cover of the rock so raym ond and i turned a nd walked back he seemed happier and began talking about t he bus to catch for our return when we reach ed the bungalow ray mond prom ptly went up the wooden steps but i halted on t he bottom one the light seem ed thuddi ng in m y head and i coul dn’t face the ef fort needed to go up the steps and mak e myself amiable to the wo men but the heat was so great that it was just as bad staying where i was under that flood of blinding li ght falli ng from the sky to sta y or to m ake a m ove—it came to m uch the same after a mo ment i returned to the beach and started walking there was the same red glare as far as eye could reach an d small waves were lapping the hot sand in little flurried gasps as i slowly walked toward the boulde rs at the end of the beach i could feel m y temples swelling under the im pact of the light it pressed itself on me trying t o check my progress and each tim e i felt a hot blast strike m y forehead i gritted m y teeth i cl enched my fists in m y trouser pockets and keyed up every nerve to fend off the sun and t he dark befuddlem ent it was pouri ng into me whenever a blade of vivi d light shot upward from a bit of shell or broken glass lying on the sand m y jaws set hard i wasn’t going t o be beaten and i walked steadily on the sm all black hump of rock came into view far down the beach it was rimmed by a dazzl ing sheen of light and feathery sp ray but i was thinking of the cold cl ear stream behind it and longing to hear again the tinkle of running water anything to be rid of t he glare the sight of women in tears the strain and effort—and to retrieve the pool of shadow by the rock and its cool silence but when i cam e nearer i saw that ra ymond’s arab had returned he was by himself this time lyi ng on his back his hands behind his head his face s haded by the rock while the sun beat on the rest of his body one could see his dungarees steam ing in the heat i was rat her taken aback my impression had been that the incident was closed and i hadn’t given a thought to it on m y way here on seeing m e the arab raised him self a little and his hand we nt to his pocket naturally i gripped raym ond’s revolver in th e pocket of m y coat then the arab let himself sink back a gain but without taki ng his hand from his pocket i was some distance off at least ten yards and m ost of the time i saw him as a blurred dark form wobbling in the heat haze so metim es however i had glim pses of his e yes glowi ng between the halfclosed lids the sound of the waves was even lazier feebler than at noon but the light hadn’t changed it was pou nding as fiercely as ever on the long stretch of sand that ended at the rock for two hours the sun seem ed to have m ade no progress becal med in a sea of molten steel far out on the horizon a steamer was passing i could just make out from the co rner of an eye the s mall black movin g patch while i kept my gaze fixed on the arab it struck m e that all i had to do was to turn walk away and think no m ore about it but the whole beach pulsing with heat wa s pressi ng on m y back i took some steps toward the stream the arab didn’t m ove after all there was still some distance between us perhaps because of the shadow on his face he seemed to be grinning at me i waited the heat was beginning to sc orch my cheeks b eads of sweat were gathering in m y eyebrows it was just the same sort of heat as at my mother’s funeral and i had the same disagreeab le sensati ons—especially in my forehead where all the veins seemed to be bursti ng through the ski n i couldn’t stand it any longer and took another step forward i kne w it was a fool thing to do i wouldn’t get out of the sun by m oving on a yard or so but i took that step just one step forward and then the arab drew his knife and he ld it up toward m e athwart the sunli ght a shaft of light shot upward from the steel and i felt as if a long thin blade transfixed my forehead at the sam e moment all the swea t that had accu mulated in my eyebrows splashed down on m y eyelids covering t hem with a warm film of moisture beneath a veil of brine and te ars my eyes were blinded i was conscious only of the cym bals of the sun clashing on m y skull and less distinctl y of the keen blade of li ght flashing up from the knife s carring my eyelashes and gouging into my eyeballs then everything be gan to reel before m y eyes a fiery gust came from the sea while the sky cracked in two from end to end and a great sheet of fl ame poured down through the rift every nerve in m y body was a steel spri ng and m y grip closed on the revolver the trigger ga ve and the smooth underbelly of the but t jogged my palm and so with that crisp whipcrack sound it all began i shook off m y sweat and the clinging vei l of light i knew i’d shattered the balance of the day the spacious cal m of this beach on which i had been happy but i fired four shots m ore into the inert body on which they left no visible trace and each success ive shot w as another loud fateful rap on the door of my undoing part t wo i i was questioned several tim es immediately after my arrest but they were all formal exam inations as to m y identity and so forth at the first of these which took pla ce at the police station nobody seemed to have m uch interest in the case however when i was brought before the exam ining magistrate a week later i no ticed that he eyed me with distinct curiosity like the othe rs he began by asking m y name address and occupation the date and place of my bi rth then he inquired if i had chosen a lawyer to defend m e i answered “no” i hadn’t t hought about it and asked him if it was really necess ary for me to have one “why do you ask that” he said i replie d that i re garded m y case as very sim ple he sm iled “well it ma y seem so to you but we’ve got to abide by the law and i f you don’t engage a lawyer the court will have to appoint one for you” it struck me as an excellent arrangement that the authorities should see to details of this kind and i told him so he nodded and agreed that the code was all that could be desired at first i didn’t take him quite seriousl y the room in which he interviewed me was m uch like an ordinary sitting room with curtained windows and a single lamp standing on the desk its light fe ll on t he armc hair in which he’d had m e sit while his own face stayed in shadow i had read descriptions of such scenes in books and at first it all seemed like a game after our conversation however i ha d a good look at him he was a tall man with cleancut features deepset blue eyes a big gray m ustache and abundant almost snowwhite hair and he gave me the im pression of being highly intelligent and on the whole likable enough there wa s only one thing that put one off his mouth had now and then a rather ugly twist but it seemed to be only a sort of nervous ti c when leaving i ve ry nearly held out m y hand an d said “goodby” j ust in time i remem bered that i’d killed a man next day a lawyer came to m y cell a small plum p youngish m an with sleek black hair in spite of the heat—i was in my shirt sleeves— he was wearing a dark suit stiff collar and a rather showy tie with broad black and white stripes after depositi ng his brief case on my bed he in troduced him self and added that he’d perused the record of my cas e with the utmost care his opinion was that it would need cautious handli ng but there was ever y prospect of m y getting off provided i followed his advice i thanke d him and he said “good now let’s get down to it” sitting on the bed h e said that they’d been making investigations into m y private life they had learned that m y mother died recently in a home inquiries had been conducted at marengo and the police inform ed that i’d shown “gr eat callousness” at my mother’s funeral “you m ust understa nd” the lawyer said “that i don’t relish having t o question you about such a matter but it has m uch im portance and unless i find some way of answering the charge of ‘callousness’ i shall be handicappe d in conducting your defense and that is where you and only you can help m e” he went on to ask if i had felt grief on th at “sad occasion” the question struck m e as an odd one i’d have been much em barrassed if i’d had to ask anyone a thing li ke that i answered that of recent year s i’d rather lost the hab it of noti ng m y feelings and hardly kne w what to answer i could trut hfully say i’d been quite fond of mother— but really that didn’t mean m uch all nor mal people i added as on afterthought had more or less desired the death of those th ey loved at some time or another here the lawyer interrupted m e looking greatly perturbed “you m ust prom ise me not t o say anything of that sort at th e trial or to the exam ining m agistrate” i prom ised to satisfy him but i explaine d that m y physical conditi on at any given moment often influe nced m y feelings fo r instance on the day i attended mother’s funeral i was fagged out and only half awake so really i hardly t ook stock of what was happening anyhow i could assure him of one thing that i’d rather mother hadn’t die d the lawyer however looked displeased “that’s not enough” he said curtly after considering for a bit he asked m e if he could say that on that day i had kept my feelings under control “no” i said “that wouldn’t be true” he gave me a queer look as if i slight ly revolted him then inform ed m e in an almost hostile tone that in any case the head of the ho me and som e of the sta ff would be cited as witnesses “and that m ight do you a very na sty turn ” he concluded when i suggested that mother’s death ha d no connection with the charge against me he merely replied that this remark showed i’d neve r had any dealings with t he law soon after this he left looking quite vexe d i wished he had stayed longer and i could have explained that i de sired his sym pathy not for hi m to make a better job of my defense but if i m ight put it so s pontaneousl y i could see that i got on hi s nerves he couldn’t make me out and naturally enough th is irritated him once or twice i had a m ind to assure him that i wa s just like everybody else quite an ordinary person but really t hat would have serv ed no great purpose and i let it go—out of laziness as much as anything else later in the day i was taken again to t he exam ining magistrate’s office it was two in the afternoon and this tim e the room was flooded with light—there was only a thin curtai n on the window—and extremely hot after inviting m e to sit down the m agistra te informed m e in a very polite tone that “owing to unforeseen cir cumstances” my lawyer was unable to be present i should be quite entitled he added to reserve m y answer s to his questions until my lawyer could attend to this i replied that i could answer fo r myself he pressed a bell push on his desk and a young clerk came in and seated hims elf just behind me then we—i and t he magistrate—settled back in our chairs a nd the exam ination began he led off by remarking that i had the reputation of bei ng a taci turn rather selfcentered person and he’d like to know what i ha d to say t o that i an swered “well i rarely have anythi ng much to sa y so naturally i keep m y mouth shut” he s miled as on the previous occasion and agreed that that was the best of reasons “in any case” he added “it has little or no im portance” after a short silence he suddenly leaned fo rward looked me in the eyes and said raising his voice a little “what really interests m e is—you” i wasn’t quite clear what he meant so i made no comment “there are several things” he continued “that puzzle me about your cri me i feel sure that you will help me to understand them ” when i replied that really it was quite si mple he asked me to give him an account of what i’d done that day as a matter of fact i had already told hi m at our first interview—in a summary sort of way of course —about raym ond the beach our swim the fight then the beach again and th e five shots i’d fired but i went over i t all again and after each phras e he nodded “quite so quite so” when i described the body lyi ng on t he sand he nodded m ore em phatically and sa id “good” i was tired of repeating the same story i fe lt as if i’d never talked so m uch in all m y life before after another silence he stoo d up and sai d he’d l ike to help me i interested him and with god’s hel p he would do something for m e in my trouble but first h e must put a few more questions he began by asking blunt ly if i’d loved my m other “yes” i replied “like everybody else” the clerk behind m e who had been typing away at a steady pace m ust just then ha ve hit the wrong keys as i heard him pushing the carrier back and crossi ng something out next without any apparent logical conn ection the m agistra te sprang anothe r question “why did you fire fi ve consecutive shots” i thought for a bit then explained that th ey weren’t quite consecutive i fired one at first and the other four after a short int erval “why did you pause between the first and second shot” i seemed to see it hovering again before my eyes the red glow of the beach and to feel that fi ery breath on my cheeks —and this tim e i m ade no answer during t he silence that followed the magi strate kept fidgeting runni ng his fi ngers through his hair half rising then sitting down again finally planting his elbows on the desk he bent toward m e with a queer expression “but why why did you go on fi ring at a prostrate m an” again i found nothing to reply the magistrate drew his hand across his forehead and repeated in a slightly different t one “i ask you ‘ why’ i insist on your telling me” i still kept silent suddenl y he rose walked to a file cab inet standing agai nst the opposite wall pulled a drawer open and took from it a silv er crucifix which he was waving as he came b ack to the des k “do you know who this i s” his voice ha d changed com pletely it was vibrant with em otion “of course i do” i an swered that seemed to start him off he began speaking at a great pace he told me he believed in god and that even the worst of sinners could obtain forgi veness of him but first he m ust rep ent and beco me like a little child with a sim ple trustful heart open to conviction he was leaning right acr oss the table brandishing his crucifix before m y eyes as a matter of fact i had gre at difficult y in following his remarks as for one thing the office was so stiflingly hot and big flies were buzzin g round and settling on my cheeks also because he rat her alar med me of course i realized it was absurd to feel like this considering that after all it was i wh o was th e criminal however as he continued talking i did m y best to un derstand and i gathe red that there was only one point in m y confession that badly n eeded clearing up—the fact that i’d waited before firi ng a second time all the rest was so to speak quite in order but that completely baffled him i started to tell him that he was wrong in insisting on this th e point was of quite minor im portance but before i could get the words out he ha d drawn hi mself up t o his full height and was asking me very earn estly if i believed in god when i said “no” he plum ped down into hi s chair indignantly that was unthi nkabl e he said all men believe in god ev en those who reject hi m of this he was absolutely sure if ever he came to doubt it his life would l ose all meaning “do you wish” he asked indi gnantl y “m y life to have no meaning” really i couldn’t see how my wishes came into it and i told him as m uch while i was talking he thrust the crucif ix again just under my nose and shouted “i anyhow am a christian and i pray him to forgive you for your si ns my poor young man how can you not believe th at he suffered for your sake” i not iced that his m anner seemed genuinely solicitous when he said “my poor young m an”—but i was beginning to have enough of it the room was growing steadily hotter as i usuall y do when i want to get rid of someone whose conv ersation bores me i pretended to agree at which rath er to m y surprise his face lit up “you see you see now won’t you own th at you believe and put your trust i n him” i must have shaken m y head again for he sank back in his chair looking lim p and deject ed for some mo ments there was a silence during which the type writer which had been clicking away all the time we talked caught up with the last remark then he looked at me intently and rather sadly “never in all m y experience have i known a soul so casehardened as yours” he said in a low tone “all the criminals who have co me before m e until now wept wh en they saw this sym bol of our lord’s sufferi ngs” i was on the point of replying that was precisely because they were criminals but then i realized that i too came under th at description som ehow it was an idea to which i never could get reconciled to indicate presumably that the interv iew was over the magistrate stood up in the same weary tone he as ked m e a last question di d i regret what i had done after thinking a bit i said that what i felt was less regret than a kind of ve xation— i couldn’t find a better word for it but he di dn’t seem to understa nd this was as far as things went at that day’s interview i came before the magistrate many tim es more but on these occasions m y lawyer always accom panied m e the exam inations we re confined t o asking me to amplify my previous statements or else the magistrate and m y lawyer discussed technicalities at such tim es they took ve ry little notice of m e and in any case the tone of t he examinations changed as time went on the magistra te seemed to hav e lost interest in me and to have come to some sorto f decision about m y case he never m entioned god again or displayed a ny of the religious fervor i had found so embarrassing at our first inte rview th e result was that our relations be came m ore cordial after a few q uestions followed by an exchange of remarks with the lawyer the m agistrate closed the in terview my case was “taking it s course” as he put it sometimes too the conversation was of a general order and the m agistrate and lawyer encouraged me to join in it i began to breathe m ore freely neither of the two men at th ese tim es showed the least hostility toward m e and everything went so smoothly so am iably that i had an absurd impression of being “one of the fam ily” i can honestly say that during t he eleven m onths these exam inations lasted i got so used to them that i was alm ost surprised at having ever enjoyed anything better than those rare mo ments when the magistrate after escorting me to the door of the office would pat m y shoulder and say in a friendly tone “well mr antichrist that’s all for the present” after which i wa s made over to m y jailers ii there ar e some things of wh ich i’ve ne ver cared to talk and a few days after i’d been sent to pri son i decided that this pha se of m y life was one of them however as time went by i came to feel that this aversi on had no real substanc e in point of fact during t hose early days i was hardly consci ous of being i n prison i had always a vague hope that so mething would tu rn up some agr eeable surprise the chang e came so on after marie’s first a nd only visit from the day when i got her letter telling me they wouldn’t let her come t o see me any more because s he wasn’t m y wife—it was from that day that i realized that this ce ll was my last home a dead end so to speak on the day of m y arrest they put me in a biggish room with several other prisoners m ostly arabs they grinned w hen they saw me enter and as ked me what i’d done i told them i’d killed an ar ab and they kept m um for a while but presently night began to fall and one of them explained to me how to lay out my sleeping mat by rolling up one end one makes a sort of bol ster all night i felt bugs crawling over m y face some days later i was put by m yself in a cell where i slept on a plank bed hinged to the wall the only other furniture was a la trine b ucket and a tin basin the prison stands on rising ground and through m y little window i had glim pses of the sea on e day when i was hanging on the bars straini ng m y eyes toward the sunl ight playing on the waves a jailer entered a nd said i had a visitor i th ought it must be marie and so it was to go to t he visitors’ room i was taken al ong a corridor then up a flight of steps then along another corridor it was a ve ry large room lit by a big bow window and divided into three com partments by high iron grille s running transversally between the two grilles there was a gap of som e thirty feet a sort of no man’s land between the prisoners and their friends i was led to a poi nt exactly opposite marie who was wearing her striped dress on m y side of the rails were about a dozen other prisoners arabs for the m ost part on marie’s side were m ostly moor ish women she was wedged between a small old wo man with tightset lips and a fat matron without a hat who was talking shrill y and gesticulated all t he time because of the distance between the visitors and prisoners i f ound i too had to raise my voice when i came into the room the babel of voices echoing on the bare walls and the sunli ght st ream ing in flooding everything in a harsh white glare made me feel quite dizzy after the relative darkness and th e silence of m y cell it took m e some moments to get used to these conditions after a bit however i came to see each face quite clearly lit up as if a spotlight played on it i noticed a prison official seat ed at e ach end of t he no man’s land bet ween the grilles the native p risoners and their re lations on the other side were squatting opposite each other they didn’t raise their voices and in spite of the din m anaged to converse alm ost in whispers this m urmur of voi ces com ing from below m ade a sort of accom paniment to t he conversations going on above their heads i took stoc k of all this very quickly and m oved a step forward toward marie she was pressing her brown suntanned face to the bars and smiling as hard as she could i thought sh e was looking very pretty but somehow couldn’t bring m yself to tell her so “well” she asked pitching her voice very high “what about it are you all right have you everything you want” “oh yes i’ve everything i want” we were silent for some m oments ma rie went on sm iling the fat wom an was bawling at the prisoner beside me her husband presumably a tall fair pleasant looki ng man “jeanne refused to ha ve him ” she yelled “that’s just too bad ” the man replied “yes and i told her you’ d take him back the moment you got out but she wouldn’t hear of it” marie shouted across the gap that raymond sent me his best wishes and i said “thanks” but m y voice was dr owned by m y neighbor’s asking “if he was quite fit” the fat woman gave a laugh “fit i should say he is the picture of health” meanwhile the prisoner on m y left a youngste r with thin girl ish hands never said a word his eyes i noticed were fixed on the little old woman opposite him and she returned his gaze wit h a sort of hungry passi on but i had to stop looking at them as marie was shouti ng to me th at we mustn’t lose hope “certainly not” i answered my gaze fe ll on her shoulders and i had a sudden longing to squeeze th em through the thin dress its silky texture fa scinat ed me and i had a feeling that the hope she spoke of centered on it somehow i im agine something of the same sort was in marie’ s mind for she went on sm iling looki ng straight at me “it’ll all come right you’l l see and then we sha ll get married” all i could see of her now was the white flash of her teeth and the little puckers round her eyes i answered “do you really think so” but chiefly becau se i felt it up to me to answer so mething she started talking very fast in the same highpitched voice “yes you’ll be acquitted and we’ ll go bathing again sundays” the woman beside me was still yelling a way telling her husband that she’d left a basket for him in the prison office she ga ve a list of the thi ngs she’d brought a nd told him to m ind and check them carefully as some had cost quite a lot th e youngster on m y other side and his m other were still gazing m ournfully at each other and the m urmur of the arabs droned on below us the light out side seemed to be surging up against the window seeping through and smearing the faces of the people facing it with a coat of yellow oil i began to feel slightly squeam ish and wished i could leave the strident voice beside m e was jarring on m y ears but on the other hand i wanted to have the most i could of marie’s com pany i’ve no idea how m uch tim e passed i remem ber marie’s describing to me her work with that se t smile always on her face there wasn’t a moment’s letup in the noise—shouts c onversations and always that m uttering undertone the only oasis of silence wa s made by the young fellow and the old woman gazing into each other’s eyes then one by one the arabs were led away alm ost everyone fell silent when the first one left the little old woman pressed he rself against the bars and at the same moment a jailer tapped her s on’s shoul der he called “ au revoir mother” and slippi ng her hand between the bars she ga ve him a small sl ow wave with it no sooner was she gone than a man hat in hand t ook her pl ace a prisoner was led up to the empty place be side me and the two started a brisk exchange of remarks—not loud however as the room had becom e relatively quiet someon e came and called away the m an on m y right and his wife shouted at him —she didn’t seem to realize it was no longer nece ssary to shout—“n ow m ind you l ook after yourself dear and don’t do anything rash” my turn came next marie threw me a kiss i looke d back as i walked away she hadn’t moved her face wa s still pressed to the rails her li ps still parted in that tense twisted smile soon after this i had a letter from her and it was then that the things i’ve never liked to ta lk about began not that they we re particularly terrible i’ve no wish t o exaggerate and i suffered less than others still there was one thing in those early days that was really irksom e my habit of thinking like a fr ee man f or instance i would suddenly be seized with a desire to go dow n to the beach for a swim and merely to have imagined the sound of ripples at m y feet the sm ooth feel of t he water on m y body as i st ruck out and the wonderfu l sensation of relie f it gave brought home still m ore cruelly the narrowness of m y cell still that phase lasted a few m onths only afterward i had prisoner’s thoughts i waited for the daily walk in th e courtyard or a visi t from my lawyer as for t he rest of the ti me i managed qui te well rea lly i’ve often t hought that had i been compelled to live in the trunk of a dead tree with nothing to do but gaze up at t he patch of sky just overhead i’d have got used to it by degrees i’d have learned to watch for the passing of birds or drift ing clouds as i had come to watch for m y lawyer’s odd neckties or in another worl d to wait patiently ti ll sunday for a spell of lovem aking with marie well here any how i wasn’t penne d in a holl ow tree trunk there were others in the world worse off than i i rem embered it had been one of mother’s pet ideas—she was al ways voicing it—t hat in the l ong run one gets use d to anything usually however i didn’t thi nk things out so far those first months were trying of course but the very effort i had to ma ke helped me through them for instanc e i was plagued by the desire for a woman—wh ich was natural enough considering my age i never thought of marie especially i was obsessed by t houg hts of this wom an or that of all the ones i’d had all the circum stances under which i’d loved them so much so that the cell grew crowded with their faces ghosts of m y old passions that unsettled me no doubt but at least it served to kill time i gradually became quite friendly with th e chief jailer who went the rounds with the kitchen hands at m ealtim es it was he who brought up t he subject of women “that’s what the men here grum ble about m ost” he told me i said i felt like that m yself “there’s so mething unfair about it” i added “like hitting a man when h e’s down” “but that’s the whole point of it” he sa id “that’s why you fellows are kept in prison” “i don’t follow” “liberty” he said “ means that you ’re being depri ved of your liberty” it had never before struck m e in that light but i saw his point “that’s true” i said “otherwise it wouldn’t be a punishm ent” the jailer nodded “yes you’re different you can use your brains the others can’t still those fellows find a way out they do it by them selves” with which remark the jailer left m y cell next day i did like the others the lack o f cigarettes too was a trial when i was brought to the prison they took away my belt my shoelaces and the contents of m y pockets including m y cigarettes once i had been given a cell to m yself i aske d to be given back anyhow the cigarettes sm oking was fo rbidden t hey informed me that p erhaps was what got m e down the most i n fact i suffered really badly duri ng the fi rst few days i even tore off spli nters from my plank bed and sucked them all day long i felt faint and bilious it passed m y understanding why i shouldn’t be allowed even to sm oke it could have done no one any harm later on i understo od the idea behind it this privation too was part of m y punishm ent but by the time i underst ood i’d l ost the craving so it had ceased to be a punishment except for these privations i wasn’t t oo unhappy yet again the whole problem was how to kill time after a while however once i’d learned t he trick of remembering t hings i never ha d a m oment ’s boredom sometimes i would exercise my mem ory on m y bedroom and starting from a corner make the round not ing every object i saw on the way at first it wa s over in a m inute or two but each time i repeated the experience it took a little longe r i m ade a point of visualizing every piece of furniture and each article upon or in it and then every detail of each article and finall y the details of th e details so to speak a tiny dent or incrustation or a chipped edge and the exact grain and colo r of t he woodwork at the sam e time i forced m yself to keep m y inventory in m ind from start to fi nish in the right order and om itting no item with the result that after a few weeks i could spend hours merely in listing the objects in m y bedroom i found t hat the m ore i thought t he more details halfforgotten or m alobser ved floated up from m y mem ory there seemed no end to them so i learned that ev en after a single da y’s experience of the outside world a man could easily live a hundred years in pri son he’d have laid up enough mem ories never to be bored obviously i n one way this was a com pensation then there was sleep to begin with i slep t badly at night and never in the day but gradually m y nights became better and i m anaged to doze off in the daytime as well in fact during the last months i must have sl ept sixteen or eighteen hours out of the twentyfour so there remained only si x hours to fill —with m eals relieving nature my memories a nd the story of t he czech one day when inspecting m y straw mattre ss i found a bit of newspaper stuck to its underside the p aper was yellow with ag e alm ost transparent but i could still make out the letter print it was the story of a cri me the first part was mi ssing but i gathered that its scene was so me village in czechoslovakia one of the villagers had left his home to try his luck abroad after twentyfive year s having made a fortune he returned to his country wit h his wife and child meanwhile his mother and sister had been running a small hotel in the village where he was born he decided to give them a surprise and leaving hi s wife and child in another i nn he went to stay at his mother’s place booking a room under an assumed nam e his m other and sister completely failed to recognize him at di nner that evening he showed them a large sum of money he had on him and in the c ourse of the night they slaughtered him with a hammer after taking the m oney they flung the body int o the river next morning his wife came and without thi nking betrayed the guest’s identity his mother hanged herself his sister threw hers elf into a well i m ust have read th at story t housands of t imes in one way it s ounded m ost unlikely in another it was plausible enough anyhow to m y mind th e man was asking for trouble one shoul dn’t play fool t ricks of that sort so what with long bouts of sleep my mem ories readings of that scrap of newspaper the tides of light and darkness the days sli pped by i’d read of course that in jail one ends up by losi ng track of time but this had never m eant anythi ng definite to me i hadn’t grasped how days could be at once long and short long no doubt as periods to live thro ugh but so distended that they ended up by overlapping on each other in fact i never thought of days as such only the words “yesterday” and “tom orrow” still kept some meaning when one m orning the jailer inform ed me i’d now been six m onths in jail i believed him—but t he words conveyed nothi ng to my mind to me it seemed like one and the same day that had been going on since i’d been in my cell and that i’d been doing the same thing all the tim e after the jailer left me i shined up m y tin panniki n and studi ed m y face in it my expression was terribly serious i thought even when i tried to sm ile i held the pannikin at different angles but always my face had the same mournful t ense expression the sun was setting and it was the hour of which i’d rat her not speak—“the nameless hour” i called it—when evening sounds were creeping up from all the floors of t he prison i n a sort of stealthy procession i went to the barred window and in the last rays looked once again at my re flected face it was as serious as before and that wasn’t surprising as just then i was feeling serious but at the same ti me i heard something that i hadn’t heard for months it w as the sound of a voi ce m y own voice there was no m istaking it and i rec ognized it as the voice that for many a day of late had been sounding i n my ears so i knew that all this time i’d been talking to myself and som ething i’d been told c ame back a remark made by t he nurse a t mother’s funeral no there was no way out and no on e can imagine what the evenings are like in prison iii on the whole i can’t say that those mo nths passed sl owly a nother summer was on its way alm ost before i realized the firs t was over and i knew that with the first really hot days som ething new was in st ore for me my case was down for the last sessions of the assize court and those sessions were due to end som e time in june the day on which m y trial started was one of brilliant sunshine my lawy er assured me the case would ta ke only t wo or three days “from what i hear” h e added “the court wi ll dispatch your case as quickly as possible as it isn’t the most important one on the cause list there’s a case of parricide immediately after which will take them some time” they came for me at halfpast seven in the m orning and i was conveyed to the law courts in a prison van the two policemen led m e into a sm all room that sm elled of darkness we sat near a door through w hich came sounds of voices shouts chairs scraping on the floor a vague hubbub whic h reminded me of one of those small town “socials” when after the concert’s over the hall is cleared for dancing one of my policemen told me the judges hadn’t arrived yet and offered m e a cigarette which i declined after a bit he asked m e if i was feeling nervous i said “no” and that the prospect of witnessing a trial rather interest ed m e i’d never had occasion to attend one before “maybe” the other policem an said “but after an hour or two one’s had enough of it” after a while a small electric bell pu rred in the room they unfastened my handcuffs opened the door and led me to the prisoner’s dock there was a great crowd in t he courtr oom though the venetian bli nds were down light was filtering through the chinks and the air stiflingly hot already the windows had been kept shut i sat down and the police offi cers took t heir stand on each side of my chai r it was then that i noticed a row of fa ces opposi te me these people were staring hard at m e and i guessed they were th e jury but somehow i didn’t see them as individual s i felt as you do j ust after boardi ng a streetcar and you’re conscious of all the people on t he opposite seat staring at you in t he hope of findi ng something i n your appearance to am use them of course i knew this was an absurd com parison what these people were looking for i n me wasn’t anythi ng to la ugh at but signs of criminality still the difference wasn’t so very gre at and anyhow that’s the idea i got what with the crowd and the stuffi ness of the air i was feeli ng a bit dizzy i ran my eyes round the courtroom but couldn’t r ecognize any of the faces at first i could hardly bel ieve that all these people had come on m y account it was such a new experience being a focus of interest in the ordinary way no one ever paid m uch attention to me “what a crush” i remarked to the policeman on my left and he explained that the newspapers were responsi ble for it he pointed to a group of men at a table ju st below the jury box “there t hey are” “who” i asked and he replied “the pre ss” one of them he added was an old friend of his a moment later the man he’d mentioned looked our way and com ing to the dock shook hands warm ly with the policem an the journalist was an elderly man with a rather grim expression but his manner was quite pleasant just then i noticed that almost all the people in the courtroom were greeting each other exchanging remarks and form ing groups—behaving in fact as in a club where the com pany of ot hers of one’s own tastes and standing makes one feel at ease th at no doubt explained the odd im pression i had of being de trop here a sort of gatecrasher however the journal ist addressed me qui te amiably and said he hoped all would go well for m e i thanked him and he added with a sm ile “you know we’ve been featuring you a bit we’re always rather short of copy i n the summer and there’s been precious little to write about except your case and the one that’s com ing on after it i expect you’ve heard about it it’s a case of parricide” he drew m y attention to one of the group at the press table a plum p small m an with huge blackrimmed glasses who ma de me think of an overfed weasel “that fellow’s the special corre spondent of one of the pa ris dailies as a m atter of fact he didn’t com e on your account he was sent for the parricid e case but they’ve asked him to cover yours as well” it was on the tip of m y tongue to say “t hat was very kind of them ” but then i thought i t would sound sil ly with a fri endly wave of his hand he left us and for some m inutes nothi ng happened then accom panied by som e colleagues m y lawyer bustled in in his gown he went up t o the press table and shook hands with the journalists they remained laughing and chatting together all seemingl y very m uch at home here until a bell rang shri lly and everyone went to his pla ce my lawyer came up to m e shook hands and advised me to answer a ll the questions as bri efly as possible not to volunt eer inform ation and to rely on him to see me through i heard a chair scrape on m y left and a ta ll thin m an wearing pincenez settled the folds of hi s red gown as he took his seat the public prosecutor i gathered a cl erk of the court announced that thei r honors we re entering and at the sam e moment two big electric fans started buzzing overhead three judges two in black and the third i n scarlet with brief cases under their arm s entered and walked briskly to the bench which was several feet above the level of the court room floor the man in scarlet took the central highbacked chair placed his cap of office on the table ran a handkerchief over hi s small ba ld crown and announced that t he hearing would now begin the journalists had t heir fountai n pens rea dy they al l wore the sam e expression of slight ly ironical indi fferen ce with the exception of one a much younger man than his colleagues in gray flannels with a blue tie who leaving his pen on the table was gazing hard at me he had a plain rather chunky face what h eld my attention were his eyes very pale clear eyes rivete d on me though not betraying any definite emotion for a m oment i had an odd im pression as if i were being scrutinized by myself that—and the fact that i was unfam iliar with court procedure—may explain why i didn’t foll ow very we ll the opening phases the drawing of lots for the jury the various questions put by t he presiding judge to the prosecutor the fore man of the jury and m y counsel eac h time he spoke all the jurym en’s heads swung round together toward the bench th e hurried reading of the char ge sheet in the course of which i recognized some fam iliar name s of people and places then some supplem entary questi ons put t o my lawyer next the judge announced that the court would call over the witness list some of the names read out by the clerk rather surprised m e from amongst the c rowd which until now i had seen as a mer e blur of faces rose one after the other ray mond masson salamano the doorkeeper from the home old pérez a nd marie who gave me a little nervous wave of he r hand before following the ot hers out by a side door i was thinki ng how st range it was i hadn’t noticed any of t hem before when i heard the last name called that of céleste as he rose i noticed beside him the quaint little woman wi th a mannish coat a nd brisk decided air who ha d shared my table at the restaurant she had her eyes fixed on me i noticed but i hadn’t tim e to wonder about her the judge had started speaking again he said that the trial proper was about t o begin a nd he need hardl y say that he expected the public t o refrain from any de monstration whatsoever he explained t hat he was there to supervise the proceedings as a sort of umpire and he would take a scrupulously im partial view of the case the verdict of the jury would be interpreted by him in a spirit of justice finally at th e least sign of a disturbance he would have the court cleared the day was stoking up some of the public w ere fanning them selves with newspapers and there was a c onstant rustle of crum pled paper on a sign from the presiding j udge the clerk of the court bro ught t hree fans of pl aited straw which the three judges prom ptly put in action my exam ination began at once the judge questioned m e quite calm ly and even i thought with a hint of cordiali ty for t he nth tim e i was asked to gi ve particulars of my identity and though heartily sick of this form ality i realized that it was natural enough after all it would be a shocking thing for the court to be trying the wrong man the judge then launched into an account of what i’d done stopping after every two or three senten ces to ask me “is that correct” to which i always replied “yes sir” as my lawyer had advised me it wa s a long business as the judge lingered on each detail meanwhile the journalists sc ribbled busily away but i was so metimes conscious of the eyes of the youngest fixe d on m e also those of the queer little robot wom an the jurymen however were all g azing at the redrobed judge and i was again rem inded of the row of passengers on on e side of a tram presently he gave a slight cough turned some p ages of his fi le and still fanning his face addressed me gravely he now proposed he said to trench on certain matters which on a superficial view mig ht seem foreign to the cas e but actually were highly relevant i guessed that he was going t o talk about mother a nd at the same m oment realized how odi ous i would fi nd this hi s first question was why had i sent m y mother to an instit ution i replied that the reason was sim ple i hadn’t enough m oney to see that she was properl y looked aft er at home then he asked if the parti ng hadn’t caused me distress i explained that neithe r mother no r i expected m uch of one anot her—or for that matter of anybody else so both of us had got used to the new conditions easily enough the judge t hen said t hat he had no wish t o press the point and asked t he prosecutor if he coul d think of any m ore ques tions that should be put to me at this stage the prosecutor who had his back half turn ed to me said without looking i n my direction that subject to his honor’s a pproval he would li ke to know if i’d gone back to the stream with the intention of killing the arab i said “no ” in that case why had i taken a revolver wit h me and why go ba ck precisely to that spot i said it was a mat ter of pure chance the prosecutor then observed in a nasty tone “very good that will be all for the present” i couldn’t quite follow what came next anyhow after some palavering am ong the bench the prosecutor and m y counsel th e presiding judge announced that the court would now rise there was an adjournm ent till the afternoon when evidence would be taken almost before i knew what was happening i was rushed out to the pri son van which drove m e back and i was given m y midday m eal after a sh ort tim e just enough for me to realize how tired i was feeli ng they came for me i was back in the same room confronting the same faces a nd the whole thing started again but the heat had meanwhile much in creas ed and by some miracl e fans had been procured for everyone the jury m y lawyer the pros ecutor and som e of the journalists too the young m an and the robot wom an were still at their places bu t they were not fanning them selves and as before they never took their eyes off m e i wiped t he sweat from my face but i was barely conscious of where or who i was until i heard the warden of the home called to the witness box when asked if my mother had com plained about my conduct he said “yes” but that didn’t mean much almost all the inmates of the ho me had grievances against their re latives th e judge asked him to be m ore explicit did she reproach m e with having sent her to the home an d he said “yes” again but this time he didn’t qualify his answer to another question he replied that on th e day of the funeral he was somewhat surprised by m y calm ness asked to expl ain what he meant by “my calmn ess” t he warden lowered his eyes and s tared at hi s shoes for a m oment then he explained that i hadn’t wanted to see mother’s body or shed a single tear and that i’d left immediately the funeral ende d without lingering at he r gra ve another thing had surprised him one of the un dertaker’s men told him that i didn’t know m y mother’s age there was a short silence then the j udge asked him if he m ight take it that he was referring t o the prisoner in t he dock th e warden seemed puzzled by this and th e judge expl ained “it’s a form al question i am bound to put it” the prosecutor was then asked if he had any quest ions t o put and he answered loudl y “certainly not i have all i want ” his tone and the look of tri umph on his face as he glanced at me wer e so m arked that i felt as i hadn’t felt for ages i had a fooli sh desire to burst into tears for th e first time i ’d realized how all t hese people loathed me after asking the jury and m y lawyer if th ey had any questions the judge heard the doorkeeper’s evidence on stepping into th e box t he man threw a gl ance at me then looked away replying to questi ons he said that i’d declin ed to see mother’s body i’d sm oked cigarettes and slept and drunk café au lait it was then i felt a sort of wave of indignation spreading through the court room and for the first t ime i understood that i was guilt y they got the doorkeeper to repeat what he had said about the coffee and m y smoking the prosecutor turned to m e again with a gloati ng look i n his eyes my counsel asked the doorkeeper if he too hadn’t smoked but the prosecutor took strong exception to this “i’d like to know” he cr ied indignantly “who is on trial in this court or does m y friend think that by aspe rsing a witness for t he prosecution he will shake the evidence the abundant and cogent evidence against hi s client” none the less the judge told the doorkeep er to answer the question the old fellow fidge ted a bit then “well i know i didn’t ought t o have done it” he m umbled “but i did take a cigarette from the young gentl eman when he offered it—just out of polite ness” the judge asked me if i had any comment to make “none” i said “except that the witness is quite right it’s true i offered hi m a ci garette” the doorkeeper looked at m e with surprise and a sort of gratitude then after hemm ing and hawing for a bit he volunteered the statement that it was he who’d suggested i shoul d have some coffee my lawyer was exultant “the jury will appreciate” he said “the im portance of this adm ission” the prosecutor how ever was prom ptly on hi s feet again “quite so” he boom ed above our heads “the jury will appreciate it and they w ill draw the conclusion that though a third part y might inadvertently offe r him a cup of coffee the prisoner in comm on decency should have re fused it if only out of re spect for the dead body of the poor woman who had brought him into the world” after which the doorkeeper went back to his seat when thomas pérez was called a court officer had to help him to the box pérez stated that though he had been a great friend of m y mother he had met me once only on the day of the fune ral asked how i had beha ved that day he said “well i was m ost upset you know far t oo much upset to not ice things my grief sort of bl inded me i think it had been a gr eat shock m y dear friend’s death in fact i fainted during t he funeral so i didn’t hardly notice the young gentlem an at all” the prosecutor asked him to tell the court if he’d seen me weep and when pérez answered “no” added em phatica lly “i trust the jury will take note of this reply” my lawy er rose at o nce and asked pérez in a tone that seemed to me needlessly aggressive “now think well my man can you sw ear you saw he didn’t shed a tear” pérez answered “no” at this some people tittered and m y lawyer pushing back one sleeve of his gown said sternly “that is typical of the way this case is be ing conducted no attem pt is be ing m ade to elicit the true facts” the prosecutor ignored this remark he was making dabs w ith hi s pencil on t he cover of his brief seem ingly quite indifferent there was a break of five min utes durin g which my lawyer told me the case was going very well inde ed then céleste was called he was announced as a witness for the defense the d efense meant me now and again céleste threw me a glance he kept squeezing hi s panam a hat between his hands a s he gave evidence he was in his best suit the one he wore when someti mes of a sunday he went with me to the races but evidently he hadn’t been able to get his collar on the top of his shi rt i noticed was secured only by a brass stud asked if i was one of his custom ers he said “yes and a friend as well” asked to state his opinion of me he said that i was “all right” and when told to explain what he meant by that he replied that everyone knew what that meant “was i a secretive sort of man” “no” he answered “i shoul dn’t c all him that but he isn’t one to was te his breath like a l ot of folks” the prosecutor asked him if i always se ttled m y monthly bill at his restauran t when he presented it céleste laughed “oh he paid on the nail all right but the bills were just detailslike between him and me ” then he was asked to say what he thought about the crime he placed his hands on t he rail of the box and one could see he had a speech all r eady “to my mind it was just an accident or a stroke of bad luck if you prefer and a thing li ke that takes you off your guard” he wanted to continue but the judge cut him short “quite so that’s all thank you” for a bit cél este seemed flabbergasted th en he explained t hat he hadn’t fi nishe d what he wanted to say they told hi m to continue but to make it brief he only repeated that it was “just an accid ent” “that’s as it m ay be” the judge observed “b ut what we are here for is to try such accidents according to law you can stand down” céleste turned and gazed at me his eyes were moist and his lips trembli ng it was exactly as if he’d said “well i’ve done my best for you old man i’m afraid it hasn’t helped m uch i’m sorry ” i didn’t say anything or m ake any m oveme nt but for the first tim e in m y life i wanted to kiss a m an the judge repeated his order to stand down and céleste returned to his place amongst the crowd during t he rest of th e hearing he remained there leaning forward elbows on knees and his panama between his hands not m issing a word of the proceedings it was marie’s turn next she had a hat on and still looked qu ite pretty though i much preferred her with her hair free from where i was i had glim pses of the soft curve of her breasts and her underlip ha d the little pout that always fascinated me she appeared very nervous the first question was how long had sh e known me since the time when she was in our office she replied then the judge asked her what were the relations between us and she said she was m y girl friend answering a nother question she admitted prom ising to marry me the prosecu tor who had been studying a docu ment in front of him asked her rather sharply when our “liaison” had begun she gave the date he then observed with a wouldbe cas ual air that apparently she meant the day following m y mother’s funeral after letting this sink in he rem arked in a slightly ironic t one that obviousl y this was a “delicate topic” and he could enter int o the young lady’s feelings but—and here his voice grew sterner—his duty obli ged hi m to waive considerations of delicacy after m aking this announcem ent he asked marie to gi ve a full account of our doings on the day when i had “intercours e” with her for the first time marie wouldn’t answer at first but the prosecutor insisted and then she told him that we had met at the baths gone together to the pictures and then to m y place he then inform ed the court that as a result of certain st atements made by marie at t he proceedings before the magistrate he had studied the movie prog rams of that date and turni ng to marie asked her to nam e the film that we had gone to see in a very low voice she said it was a pict ure with ferna ndel in it by the time she had finished the courtroom was so still you c ould have heard a pin drop looking very grave the prosecutor drew himself up to his ful l height and point ing at m e said in such a tone that i could have sworn he was genuinely m oved “gentlemen of the jury i would have you note t hat on the next day after his mother’s funeral that man was visiti ng the swimm ing pool st arting a li aison with a girl and going to see a com ic film that is all i wish to say” when he sat down there was t he same d ead silence then all of a sudden marie burst into tears he’d got it all wrong she said it wasn’t a bit like that really he’d bullied her into saying the opposite of what she meant she knew me very well and she was sure i hadn’t done anything rea lly wrong—and so on at a sign from the presiding judge one of the court officers led her away and the hearing continued hardly anyone seemed to listen to masson th e next witness he stated that i was a respectabl e young fe llow “and what’s more a very decent ch ap” nor did they pa y any m ore attention to salaman o when he to ld them how kind i’d always been t o his dog or when in answer to a question a bout my mother and m yself he said that mother and i had ve ry little in co mmon and that explaine d why i’d fixe d up for her to enter t he home “you’ve got to unde rstand” he added “you’ve got to understand” but no one seemed to unders tand he was told to stand down raym ond was the next and last witness he gave me a little wa ve of his hand and led off by saying i was innocen t the judge rebuked him “you are here to give evidence not your views on t he case and you m ust confi ne yourself to answering the questions put you” he was then asked t o make cl ear his re lations with the de ceased and raym ond took this opport unity of explaining t hat it was he not i against whom the dead man had a grudge because he ra ymond had beaten up his si ster the judge asked him if the deceased had no reason to dislike me too raym ond told him that m y presence on the beach that m orning was a pure coincidence “how comes it then” the prosecutor i nquired “that the lett er which led up t o this tragedy was the prisoner’s work” raym ond replied that this too was due to m ere chance to which the prosecutor retorted that in this case “chance” or “mere coincidence ” seemed to play a remarkably large part was it b y chance t hat i hadn’t intervened when raym ond assaulted his m istress did this convenient term “chance” account for m y having vouc hed for raym ond at the police station and having made on that occasion statements extravagantly favor able to him i n conclusion he asked raym ond to state what were his m eans of livelihood on his describing hi mself as a warehousem an the prosecutor in form ed the jury it was common knowledge that the witness lived on the imm oral earnings of wom en i he said was this m an’s intim ate friend and associate in fact the whole background of the cri me was of the m ost squalid descri ption a nd what made it even m ore odious was the personality of the prisoner an inhum an m onster wholly without a m oral sense raym ond began to expost ulate and m y lawyer too protested they were told that the prosecutor m ust be allowed to finish his rem arks “i have nearly done” he said then tu rned to raym ond “was the prisoner your friend” “certainly we were the best of pals as they say” the prosecutor then put me the same ques tion i l ooked hard at ray mond and h e did not t urn away then “yes” i answered the prosecutor turne d toward the jury “not only did t he man before you in the do ck indulge in the most shamef ul orgies on the day following his m other’s death he killed a man coldbloodedly in pursuance of som e sordid vendetta in the underworl d of prosti tutes and pim ps that gentlem en of the jury is the t ype of m an the prisoner is” no sooner had he sat down than m y lawyer out of all patience raised his arm s so high that his sleeves fell back showing th e full length of his sta rched shirt cuffs “is m y client on trial for having buried hi s mother or for ki lling a man” he asked there were so me titters in court but then the prosecutor sprang to his feet and draping hi s gown round him said he was amazed at his fri end’s ingenuousness in failing to see that bet ween these two elements of the case th ere was a vital link they hung together psyc hologically if he m ight put it so “in short” he concluded speaking with great vehemence “i accuse the prisoner of behaving at his m other’s funeral in a way that showed he was already a cri minal at hear t” these words seemed to take much effect on the jury and publ ic my lawyer merely shrugged his shoul ders and wi ped the sweat from his forehead but obviousl y he was rattled an d i had a feeling th ings weren’t going well for me soon after this incident the court rose as i was being taken fro m the courthouse to the prison van i was conscious for a few brief m oments of the once fami liar feel of a summer evening outofdoors and sitting in the darkness of m y moving cell i recognized echoing in m y tired brain all the characteristic soun ds of a town i’d loved and of a certain hour of t he day whic h i had always particularly enjoyed the shout s of newspaper boys i n the already langui d air the last calls of birds i n the public garden the cries of sa ndwich vendors the screech of streetcars at the st eep corners of the upper town and that faint rustli ng overhead as darkness sifted dow n upon t he harbor—all these sounds m ade m y return to pri son like a blind m an’s journey al ong a rout e whose every inch he knows by heart yes this was the evening hour when—how long ago it seemed—i always felt so well content with life then what awaited me was a night of easy dream less sleep this was the sam e hour but w ith a differe nce i was returning to a cell and what awaited me was a night haunt ed by forebodings of t he coming day and so i learned that fam iliar paths traced in the dusk of su mmer evenings m ay lead as well to prisons as to innocent untroubled sleep iv it is always interesting even in the pr isoner’s doc k to hear oneself being talked about and certainly in the speech es of my lawyer and the prosecuting counse l a great deal was said about m e more in fact about m e personally than about m y crime really there wasn’t any very great di fference b etween the two speeches counsel for the defense raised his arm s to heav en and pleaded guilty but with e xtenuating circu mstances the prosecutor m ade similar gestures he agreed that i was guilty but denied extenuating circum stances one thing about thi s phase of t he trial was rather irksom e quite often interested as i was in what they had to say i was tempted to put in a word m yself but m y lawyer had advised me not to “you won’ t do your case any good by talking” he had warned me in fact there seemed to be a conspiracy to exclude me from the proceedings i wasn’t to have any say an d my fate was to be decided out of hand it was quite an effort at times for m e to refrain from cutting them all short and saying “b ut dam n it all who’s on trial in this court i’d like to know it’s a serious matter for a man bei ng accused of murder and i’ve so meth ing really important to tell you” however on second thoughts i found i had not hing to sa y in any case i must admit that hearing oneself talked about lose s its interest very soon the prosecutor’s speech especially began to bore me befo re he was halfway through it the onl y things tha t really caught m y attention we re occasional phrases his gestures and some el aborate tirades—but th ese wer e isolated patches what he was ai ming at i gather ed was to show that m y crim e was premeditated i remember his saying at one m oment “i can prove this gentlemen of the jury to the hilt first you have the facts of the crime which are as clear as daylight and then you have what i m ay call the night side of thi s case the da rk workings of a crim inal mentality” he began by summ ing up the facts from my m other’s death onward he stressed my heartlessness m y inability to state mother’s age m y visit to the swimming pool where i m et marie our matinee at the pi ctures where a fe rnandel film was showing and finally m y return with marie to m y rooms i didn’t quite foll ow hi s remarks at first as he kept on mentioning “the pri soner’s m istress” whereas for m e she was just “marie” then he came to the subject of ra ymond it seemed to m e that his way of treating the facts showed a certain shrewdne ss all he said sounded quite plausible i’d written the letter in collusion with raym ond so as to entice his mistress to his room and subject her to ill treatment by a man “of more than dubious reputation” then on the beach i’d provok ed a brawl with raym ond’s enem ies in the course of which raym ond was wounde d i’d asked him for his revolver and gone back by myself with the intention of using it then i’d shot the arab after the first shot i waited then “to be certain of m aking a good j ob of it” i fired four m ore shots deliberately pointbl ank and in cold blood at m y victim “that is my case” he said “i have descri bed to you the series of events which led this man to kill the deceased fully aware of wh at he was doing i em phasize this point we are not concerned with an act of hom icide committed on a sudden im pulse which m ight serve as extenuation i ask you to note gentlemen of the jury that t he prisoner is an educated man you will have observe d the way in which he answered my questions he is intelligent and he knows the value of wo rds and i repeat that it is quite im possible to assu me that wh en he co mmitt ed the cri me he was unaware what he was doing” i noticed that he laid stress on m y “intel ligence” it puzzled me r ather why what would count as a good point in an ordinary person should be used against an accus ed man as an overwhelm ing proof of his guilt while thinking this over i m issed what he said next until i heard him exclaim indignantly “and has he uttered a word of regret for his m ost odious crime not one word gentlem en not on ce in the course of these proceedings did this ma n show the least contrition” turning t oward the dock he pointed a finger at me and went on i n the same strain i really couldn’t underst and why he harp ed on this point so m uch of course i had to ow n that he was right i didn’t feel much regret for what i’d done still to my mind he overdid it and i’d have liked to ha ve a chance of explaining to him in a quite friendly alm ost affectionate way that i have never been able really t o regre t anything i n all m y life i’ve always been far too much ab sorbed in the present moment or the imm ediate future to think b ack of course in th e position into which i had been forced there was no question of my speaking to anyone in that tone i hadn’t the right to show any friendly fee ling or possess good inte ntions and i tried to follow what came next as the prosecutor was now cons idering what he called m y “soul” he said he’d studied it closely—and had found a blank “literally nothing gentlem en of the jury” really he said i had no soul there was nothi ng hum an about me not one of those moral qualities which normal men possess had any place in my mentality “no doubt” he added “we should not re proach him with this we cannot blam e a man for lacking what it was never in his power to acq uire but i n a cri minal court the wholly pa ssive ideal of tolerance m ust give place to a sterner loftier ideal that of justice especi ally when this lack of every decent instinct is such as that of the man before you a menace to society” he proceeded to discuss m y conduct toward my mother repeating what he had said in th e course of the hearing but he spoke at much greater length of my crime— at su ch le ngth indeed that i lost the thread and was conscious onl y of the stead ily increasing heat a mo ment came wh en the pros ecutor paused and after a short silence said in a low vibrant voice “this sam e court gen tlemen will be called on to try tom orrow that most odious of cri mes the murder of a father by hi s son” to his m ind such a crime was alm ost unimaginable but he ve ntured to hope j ustice would be meted out without paltering and yet he made bold t o say the ho rror that even the crime of parricide inspired in him paled beside the loathing inspired by m y callousness “this m an who is morally guilty of his m other’s death is no less unfit to have a place in the co mmu nity than that other ma n who did to death the father that begat him and indeed the one crime led on to th e other the first of these two crim inals the m an in the dock set a precedent if i may put it so and authorized the second crime yes gentlemen i am convinced”— here he raised his voice a tone—“that you will not find i am exaggerating the case against the prisoner when i say that he is also guilty of t he murder to be tried tom orrow in this court and i look t o you for a verdict accordingly” the prosecutor paused again to wipe th e sweat off his face he then explained that his duty was a painful one but he woul d do it without flinching “this m an has i repeat no place in a co mmunity whose basic principles he flouts without compunction nor heartless as he is has he any claim to mercy i ask you to im pose the extreme penalty of the law and i ask it without a qualm in the course of a long career in which it has often been m y duty to ask for a capital sentence never have i felt that painful duty weigh so little on m y mind as in the present case in demanding a verdict of m urder without extenuating ci rcum stances i am following not only t he dictates of my conscience a nd a sacred obligation but also t hose of the natural and righteous indignation i feel at the sight of a crimi nal devoid of the least spark of human feeling” when the prosecutor sat down there was a longish silen ce personally i was quite overcome by the heat and my amazement at what i had been hearing the presidi ng judge gave a short cough and asked m e in a very l ow tone if i ha d anyt hing t o say i rose and as i felt in the m ood to speak i sa id the first t hing that crossed m y mind that i’d ha d no intention of kil ling the arab the judge repli ed that this statement would be t aken into consider ation by the court meanwhile he would be glad to hear before m y counsel addressed t he court what were the m otives of m y crime so far he m ust adm it he hadn’t fully unders tood the grounds of m y defense i tried to explain that it was because of th e sun but i spoke too quickly and ran my words int o each other i was only too c onscious that it sounded nonsensical and in fact i h eard people tittering my lawyer shrugged his shoul ders then he was directed to address the court in his turn but all he did was to point out the lateness of the hour and t o ask for an adjournm ent till the following afternoo n to this the judge agreed when i was brought back next day the el ectric fans were still churning up the heavy air and the jurym en plying their gaudy little fans in a sort of ste ady rhythm the speech for the defense seemed to m e interm inable at one m oment however i pricked up m y ears it was wh en i heard hi m saying “it is true i killed a man ” he went on in the same strain saying “i” when he referred to me it seemed so queer that i bent toward the policem an on m y right and asked him to explai n he told me to shut up then after a m oment whispered “they all do that” it seemed to me that the idea behind it was sti ll further t o exclude me from t he case to put me off the map so to speak by substituting the lawyer for m yself anyway it hardly m attered i already felt worlds away from this courtr oom and its tedious “proceedings” my lawyer in any case struck me as feeb le to the point of being ridic ulous he hurried t hrough his plea of provocation and th en he too started in about m y soul but i had an im pression that he had m uch less talent than the prosecutor “i too” he said “have closel y studied this m an’s soul but unli ke my learned friend for the prosecution i have found some thing there indeed i may say that i have read the prisoner’s m ind like an open book” what he had read there was that i was an excellent young fellow a steady conscientious worker who did his best by his em ployer that i was popul ar with ever yone and sym pathetic in others’ troubl es according to him i was a dutiful son w ho had supported hi s mother as long as he was able after anxious consid eration i had reached the conc lusion that by entering a home the old lady would have com forts that my means didn’t perm it me to provide for her “i am astounded gentlem en” he added “ by the attitude taken up by m y learned fri end in referring to this hom e surely if proof be needed of the excelle nce of such institutions we need only rem ember that they are prom oted and financed by a governm ent department” i noticed that he made no reference to the funeral and this seemed to me a serious om ission but what with his longwindedness the endless days and hours they ha d been discussing m y “soul” and the rest of it i found that m y mind had gone blurred everything was dissol ving into a grayish watery haze only one incident st ands out toward th e end while m y counsel rambled on i heard the tin trum pet of an icecream vendor in the street a small shrill sound cutting across the flow of words and then a rush of m emories went through m y mind—mem ories of a life which was m ine no longer and had once provi ded me with the surest hum blest pleasures warm smells of summer my favorite streets the sky at evening marie’s dresses and her laugh the futility of what was happening here seemed to take me b y the throa t i felt lik e vomiting and i had only one idea to get it over to go back to my ce ll and sleep and sleep dimly i heard m y counsel making his last appeal “gentlemen of the j ury surely you wil l not send to his death a decent hard working young m an because for one tragic m oment he lost his selfcontrol is he not sufficientl y punished by the lifelong rem orse that is to be his lot i confidentl y await your verdict the only verdict possibl e—that of hom icide with extenuating circu mstances” the court rose and the lawyer sat down looki ng thoroughl y exhausted som e of his colleagues came to him and shook his hand “you put up a magnificent show old man” i heard one of them say another la wyer even called me to witness “fine wasn’t it” i agreed but insincerely i was far too tired to judge if it had been “fine” or otherwi se meanwhile the day was ending and the heat becom ing less intense by some vague sounds that reached me from t he street i knew that the cool of the evening had set in we all sat on waiting and what we all were waiting for rea lly concerned nobody but m e i looked round the courtroom it was exactly as it had been on t he first day i met the eyes of the journalist in gray an d the robot woman this rem inded m e that not once during t he whole hearing had i tried to catch marie’s eye it wasn’t that i’d forgotten her onl y i was too preoccupied i saw her now seat ed between céleste and raym ond she gave m e a little wave of her ha nd as if to say “at last” she was smiling but i could tell that she was rather anxious but m y hear t seemed turned to stone and i couldn’t even return her sm ile the judges came back to their seats someone read out t o the jury very rapidly a string of questions i caught a word here and there “murder of malice aforethought provocation extenuating circum stances” the jury went out and i was taken to the little room where i had already waited my lawyer came to see me he was very talkative and showed m ore co rdiality and confidence than ever before he assured me that all would go well and i’d get of f with a few years’ im prisonm ent or transportation i aske d him what were th e chances of getting the sentence quashed he said there was no chance of that he h ad not raised any point of law as this was apt to prejudice the jury and i t was difficult to get a judgment quashed except on technical grounds i saw his point and agr eed looking at the matter dispassionately i shared his view otherwise there would be no end to litigation “in any case” the lawyer said “you can appeal i n the ordi nary way but i’m convinced the verdict will be favorable” we waited for quite a while a good three qua rters of an hour i shoul d say then a bell rang my lawyer left me saying “the foreman of the jury w ill read out the answers you will be called o n after that to hear the judgm ent” some doors banged i heard people hurrying down flights of steps but couldn’t tell whether they were near by or distan t then i heard a voice droning away in the courtroom when the bell rang again and i steppe d back into the dock the silence of th e courtroom closed in round m e and with th e silence came a q ueer sensation when i noticed that for the first tim e the young journalist kept his eyes averted i didn’t look in m arie’s direction in fact i had no tim e to look as t he presidi ng judge had already started pronouncing a rigmarole to th e effect that “in the name of the french people” i was to be decapita ted in som e public place it seem ed to m e then that i could interp ret the look on the faces of those present it was one of almost res pectful symp athy the policemen too handled me very gently the l awyer placed h is hand on m y wrist i had stopped thinking altogether i heard the judge’s voice asking i f i had anything m ore to say after thinking for a m oment i answered “no” th en the policemen l ed me out v i have just refuse d for the third time to see the prison chaplain i have nothing to say to him don’t feel like talking—and shall be seeing him quite soon enough anyway the only t hing that i nterests me now is the problem of circumventing t he machine learning if the in evitable adm its a loophol e they have m oved me to anot her cell in this one lyi ng on m y back i can see the sky and there is nothing else to see a ll my time is spent in watching the slowly changing colors of t he sky as day m oves on to night i put my hands behind my head gaze up and wait this probl em of a loophole obsesses me i am always wondering i f there have been cas es of condemned prisoners’ es caping from the i mplacab le machinery of justice at the last m oment breaking throu gh the poli ce cordon vanishing in the nick of tim e before the guillotine falls often and often i blam e myself for not having given m ore attention to accounts of publi c executions one shoul d always take an interest in such matters there’s never any knowing what one may come to like everyone else i’d read descriptions of ex ecutions i n the papers but technical books dealing with this subject m ust certainly exist only i’d never felt sufficiently interested to look them up and i n thes e books i m ight have found escape stories surely the y’d have t old m e that in one case anyhow the wheels had stopped t hat once if only once in that ine xorable marc h of events chance or luck had played a happy part just once in a wa y i think that single i nstance would have satisfied me my em otion would have done the rest the pa pers often tal k of “a debt owed to society”—a debt which according to them must be paid by t he offender but talk of that sort doesn’t touch the imagination no the one thing that c ounted for me was the possibility of m aking a dash for it and def eating their bloodthirsty rite of a mad stam pede to freedom that would anyhow give me a m oment’s hope the gam bler’s last throw naturally all that “hope” coul d com e to was to be knocked down at the corner of a street or picked off by a bullet in my back but all things considered even this luxury was forbidden m e i was caught in the rattrap irrevocably try as i might i couldn’t st omach this br utal certitude for really when one came to thi nk of it there was a disproporti on between the judgm ent on which i t was based and the unalterable sequence of events star ting from the m oment when that judgment was delivered the fact that the verdict was r ead o ut at eight pm rather than at five the fact that it m ight have been quite diff erent that it was given by m en who change their unde rclothes and was credited to so vague an entity as the “french people” — for that matter why not to the chines e or the ger man people— all these facts seemed to deprive t he court’s decision of much of its gra vity yet i could but recognize that from the m oment the verdict wa s given its effects became as cogent as tangible as for ex ample this wall agai nst which i was lying pressing m y back to it when such thoughts crossed m y mind i re membered a story mother used to tell me about m y father i never set eyes on hi m perhaps the only things i really knew about him were what mother had told me one of these was that he’d gone to see a murderer executed the mere thought of it turne d his stomach but he’d seen it through and on com ing home was violently sick at the time i found m y father’s conduct rather disgusting but now i underst ood i t was so natura l how had i failed to recogni ze that nothing was m ore im portant than an execution that viewed from one angle it’s the only thing tha t can genuin ely interest a man and i decided that i f ever i got out of jai l i’d attend every execution t hat took place i was unwise no doubt even to consider this possibility for the m oment i’d pictured m yself in freedom standing behind a double rank of po licem en—on the right si de of the line so to speak—the m ere thought of being a n onlooker who comes to see the show and can go home and vom it afterward flooded m y mind with a wild absurd exultation it was a stupid thi ng to let m y imagination run away with m e like that a m oment later i had a shivering fit and had to wrap m yself closely in m y blanket but m y teeth went on chattering not hing would st op them still obviously one can’t be sensible all the tim e another equally ridiculous fancy of mine was to frame new laws alte ring the pe nalties what was wanted to my mind was to give the crim inal a chance if only a dog’s chance say one chance in a thousand there m ight be som e drug or combination of drugs which would kil l the patient i thought of him as “the patient” nine hundred and ninety times in a thousand that he should know this was of course essential for after taking m uch thought calm ly i came to the conclusion that what was wrong about the guillotine was that the condem ned m an had no chance at all absolutely none in fact the patient’s death had been ordained irrevo cably it was a foregone conclusion if by some fluke the knife didn’t do its job they started again so it came to this that— against the grain no doubt— the condem ned man had to hope the apparatus was in good working order this i thought was a flaw in the system and on the face of it my view was sound enough on the othe r hand i had t o adm it it proved t he efficiency of the system it came to th is the m an under sentence was obliged to collaborate mentally it was in his interest that all should go off without a hitch another thing i had to recognize was th at until now i’d had wrong ideas on the subject for som e reason i’d al ways suppos ed that one had to go up ste ps and climb on to a scaffold to be guillotined probabl y that was because o f the revolution i mean what i’d learned about it at school and the pictures i had seen then one morning i rem embered a photograph the newspa pers had featured on the occasion of the executi on of a famous cri minal actu ally the apparatus stood on the ground t here was nothing very im pressing about it and it was m uch narrower than i’d imagined it struck me as rather odd that picture had escap ed my memory until now what had struck m e at the tim e was the neat appear ance of the guillotine its shining surfaces and finish rem inded me of some laborator y inst rument one always has exaggerated ideas about what one doesn’t know n ow i had to adm it it seem ed a very si mple process getting guillotined the machine is on the sam e level as the man and he walks toward it as he steps forward to meet somebody he knows in a sense that too was disappoint ing the business of clim bing a scaffold leaving the world below so to speak gave som ething for a m an’s imagin ation t o get hold of but as it was the machine dom inated everything they kill ed you discreetly with a hint of sham e and much efficiency there were two other things about which i was always thi nking the dawn and m y appeal however i did m y best to keep my mind off t hese thoughts i lay down looked up at the sky and forced m yself to study it when the light began to turn green i knew that night was com ing another thing i did to deflect the course of my thoughts was to list en to m y heart i coul dn’t im agine that thi s faint t hrobbi ng which had been with m e for so long would ever cease imagination has never been one of my strong points still i tried to picture a moment when the beating of m y heart no longer echoed in m y head but in vain th e dawn and m y appeal were still there and i ended by believing it wa s a silly thing to try to force one’s thoughts out of their natural groove they al ways came f or one at dawn that much i knew so really all m y nights were spen t in waiting for that dawn i ha ve never liked bei ng taken by surprise when something happens to me i want to be ready for it that’s why i got into t he habit of sl eeping off and on i n the dayt ime and watching through t he night for t he first hint of daybreak in the dark dom e above the worst peri od of the night was that vague hour when i knew they usually co me once it was after m idnight i waited listening intently never befo re had m y ears perceived so many noises such tiny sounds still i m ust say i wa s lucky in one respect never during any of those periods did i hear footsteps mother used to sa y that however miserable one is ther e’s always something to be thankful for a nd each m orning when the sky bri ghtened and light began to flood m y cell i agreed w ith her because i m ight just as well have heard foot steps and felt m y heart shattered into bit s even though the faintest rustle sent me hurryi ng to the door a nd pressing an ear to the rough cold wood i listened so intently that i could hear my breathi ng quick a nd hoarse like a dog’s panti ng— even so there was an end m y heart hadn’ t split and i knew i h ad another twentyfour hours’ respite then all d ay there was my a ppeal to think about i made the m ost of this idea studying my effects so as to squeeze out th e maxim um of consolation thus i always began by assum ing the worst my appeal was di smiss ed th at meant of co urse i was to die sooner than others obviously “but” i rem inded m yself “it’s common knowledge that life isn’t wort h livi ng a nyhow” and on a wide view i could see that it makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and ten—since in either case other men and women will continue living the world will go on as before also whether i died now or forty years hence this busi ness of dyi ng had to be got through inevitably still somehow this line of thought wasn’t as consoling as it shoul d have been the idea of all those years of life in hand was a galling rem inder however i could argue m yself out of it by picturing what would have been m y feelings when m y term was up and death had cornered me once you’re up against it the precise manne r of your death has obviousl y small importance therefore—but it was hard not to lose the thread of the argu ment leading up to that “therefore”—i shoul d be prepared to face the dism issal of my appeal at this stage but onl y at this st age i had so to speak the right and accordingly i gave m yself leave to consi der the ot her alternative that my appeal was successful and then the troubl e was to calm down that sudden rush of joy racing through my body and even bringing tears t o my eyes but it was up to m e to bring m y nerves t o heel and steady m y mind for even in co nsidering this possibility i had to keep some order i n my thoughts so as to make m y consolations as regards the first alternative more plausible when i’d succeeded i had earned a good hour’s peace of m ind and that anyhow was something it was at one of these mo ments that i re fused once again to s ee the chaplain i was lying dow n and coul d mark the summer ev ening com ing on by a soft golden glow spreading across the sky i ha d just tu rned down m y appeal and felt m y blood circulating with slow steady throbs no i di dn’t want to see the chaplai n th en i did som ething i hadn’t done for qui te a wh ile i fell to thinking about marie she hadn’t wri tten for ages proba bly i surm ised she had grown tired of being the mistress o f a man sentenced to death or sh e might be ill or d ead after all such things happen how could i ha ve known about it since apart from our t wo bodies separated now there was no li nk between us nothing t o remind us of each other supposing she were dead her m emory w ould m ean nothi ng i coul dn’t feel an interest in a dead girl this seemed to me quite norm al just as i realized people would soon forget me once i was dead i c ouldn’t even say that this was h ard to stom ach really there’s no idea to whic h one doesn’t get acclimatized in time my thoughts had re ached this poi nt whe n the chaplain walked in unannounced i couldn’t help giving a start on seeing him he noticed this evidently as he prom ptly told m e not to be alarm ed i rem inded him that usually his visits were at another hour and for a pretty grim occasion this he replied was just a friendly visit it had no concern with m y appeal about which he knew not hing then he sat down on m y bed asking me to sit beside him i refuse d—not because i had anything against him he seemed a mild ami able man he remained quite still at first his arm s resting on his knees his eyes fixed on his hands they were slender but sinewy hands which m ade me think of two nim ble little animals then he gently rubbed the m together he stayed so long in the sa me position that for a while i alm ost forgot he was there all of a sudden he jerked his h ead up and looked me in the eyes “why” he asked “don’t you let m e come to see you” i explained that i didn’t believe in god “are you really so sure of that” i said i saw no point in troubli ng m y head about the matter wh ether i believed or didn’t was to m y mind a ques tion of so little im portance he then leaned back against the wall l aying hi s hands flat on his t highs alm ost without se eming to address m e he remarked that he’d often noticed one fancies one is quite sure about something when in point of fact one isn’t when i said nothing he looked at me ag ain and asked “don’t you agree” i said that seemed quite possi ble but though i m ightn’t be so sure about what interested me i was absolute ly sure about what didn’t in terest me and the question he had raised didn’t i nterest m e at all he looked away and without altering hi s posture asked if it was because i felt utterly desperate that i spoke like this i e xplained that it wasn’t despair i felt but fear—which was natural enough “in t hat case” he said firm ly “god can help you all the men i’ve seen in your positi on turned to him in their time of trouble” obviously i replied they were at liberty to do so if they felt like it i however didn’t want to be helped a nd i hadn’t time to work up interest for something that didn’t interest m e he fluttered his hands fretfully then sitting up sm oothed out his cassock when this was done he began talk ing again addressing me as “my friend” it wasn’t because i’ d been condem ned to death he said that he spoke to me in this way in his opini on every m an on the earth was under sentence of death there i i nterrupted him that wasn’t th e same thing i pointed out and what’s more could be no consolation he nodded “maybe still if you don’t die soon you’ll die one day and then the same question will arise how will you face that terrible final hour” i replied that i’d face it exactly as i was facing it now thereat he stood up and look ed me straight in the eyes it was a trick i knew well i used to a muse m yself trying i t on emma nuel and céleste and ni ne times out of ten they’d look away unco mfortably i could s ee the chaplain was an old hand at it as his gaze n ever falter ed and his voice was quite steady when he said “have you no hope at all do you really think that when you die you die outright and nothi ng remains” i said “yes” he dropped his eyes and sat down again he was truly sorry fo r me he said it must make life unbearable for a man to think as i did the priest was beginning to bore m e and resting a shoulder on the wall just beneath the little skylight i looked away though i didn’t trouble much to follow what he said i gathered he was questi oning m e again presently his t one became agitated u rgent and as i reali zed that he was genuinely dist ressed i began to pay more attention he said he felt convinced m y appeal w ould succeed but i was saddled with a load of guilt of which i m ust get rid in his view man’s justice was a vain thing only god’s just ice mattered i point ed out tha t the form er had condem ned me yes he agreed bu t it hadn’t absolved me fro m my sin i told him that i wasn’t conscious of any “sin” all i knew was that i’d been gu ilty of a crim inal o ffense well i was paying the penalty of that offe nse and no one had the right to expect an ything mo re of me just t hen he got up again and it st ruck me that if he wanted to m ove in this tiny cell al most the only choice lay between standing up and si tting down i was staring at the floor he took a single step toward me and halted as if he di dn’t dare to come nearer then he looked up th rough the bars at the sky “you’re mistaken my son” he said gravel y “there’s m ore that might be required of you and perhaps it will be required of you” “what do you m ean” “you m ight be asked to see ” “to see what” slowly the priest gazed round my cell a nd i was struck by the sadness of his voice when he replied “these stone walls i know it only too well are steeped in human suffering i’ve never been able to look at them without a shudder and ye t—believe m e i am speaking from the depths of m y heart—i know that even the wr etchedest amo ngst you have sometim es seen taking form against that grayness a divine face it’s that face you are asked to see” this roused m e a little i informed him that i’d been staring at those walls for months there was nobody nothing in the world i knew better than i knew them and once upon a tim e perhaps i used t o try to see a face but it was a sungol d face lit up with desire—marie’s face i had no lu ck i’d never seen it and now i’d given up tryi ng indeed i’d never seen anythi ng “taking form” as he called it ag ainst those gray walls the ch aplain gazed at me wit h a sort of sadness i now had my back t o the wall and light was flowing over m y forehead he mut tered some words i didn’t catch then abruptly asked if he m ight kiss me i said “no” th en he turned came up to the wall and slowly drew his hand along it “do you really love these earthly things so very m uch” he asked in a low voice i made no reply for quite a while h e kept his eyes av erted his presence was getting m ore and more irksome and i was on the point of te lling hi m to go and leave me in peace when all of a sudden he swung roun d on me and burst out passionately “no no i refuse to believe it i’m sure you’ve often wi shed there was an afterlife” of course i had i told him everybody ha s that wish at times but that had no more i mportance than wishing to be rich or to swim very fast or to have a better shaped m outh it was in the same order of thi ngs i was going on in t he same vein when he cut in with a question how did i picture the life after the grave i fairly ba wled out at him “a life in which i can remember this life on earth that’s all i want of it” and i n the same breath i told him i’d had enough of his company but apparently he had m ore to say on the subject of god i went close up to him and made a last attem pt to e xplain that i’d very litt le time left and i wasn’t going to waste it on god then he tried to change the subject by asking m e why i hadn’t once addressed him as “father” seeing that he wa s a priest that irritated m e still m ore and i told him he wasn’t m y father quite the con trary he was on the others’ side “no no m y son” he said layi ng his hand on my shoulder “i’m on your side though you don’t re alize it—because your h eart is hardened but i shall pray for you” then i don’t know how it was but someth ing seemed to break inside m e and i started yelling at the top of m y voice i hurled insul ts at him i told him not to waste his rotten prayers on m e it wa s better to burn than t o disappear i’d taken him by the neckband of his cassock and in a sort of ecstasy of joy and rage i poured out on him all the thoughts that had been simmering in m y brain he seemed so cocksure you see and yet none of hi s certainties was worth one strand of a wom an’s hair living as he did like a corpse he couldn’t ev en be sure of bei ng alive it might look as if m y hands were em pty actually i was sure of m yself sure about everything far surer than he sure of m y present life a nd of the death that was com ing that no doubt was all i had but at least that ce rtainty was som ething i could get m y teeth into—just as it had got its teeth into m e i’d been right i was s till right i was always right i’d passed m y life in a certain way and i might have passed it in a different way if i’d felt like it i’d acted thus and i hadn’t acted othe rwise i hadn’t done x whereas i had done y or z and what did that mean th at all the time i’d been waiting for this present m oment for that dawn tom orrow’s or anot her day’s which was to justify m e nothing nothing had the least im portance and i knew quite well why he too knew why fro m the dark horizon of m y future a sort of slow persistent breeze had been blowing toward me all m y life long from the years that were to come and on its way that breeze ha d leveled out all the ideas that people tried to foist on m e in the equally unre al years i then was living through what difference could they make to me the deaths of others or a m other’s love or hi s god or the way a man decide s to live the fate he thinks he chooses since one and the sam e fate was bound to “choose” not on ly me but thousands of m illions of privi leged people who like hi m called them selves m y brothers sure ly surely he must see that every m an alive was privileg ed there was only one class of men th e privi leged class all alike would be condem ned to die one day his t urn too would come like the others’ and what difference could it make if afte r being c harged with murder he were executed because he didn’t w eep at his mother’s funeral since it all came to the same thing in the end th e same thing for sa lamano’s wife and for salamano’s dog that little robot woman was as “guilty” as the girl from paris who had m arried masson or as ma rie who wanted me to marry her what did it matter if raym ond was as m uch m y pal as céleste w ho was a far wort hier m an what did i t matter if at this very m oment marie wa s kissi ng a new boy friend as a condemned man him self couldn’t he gra sp what i me ant by that dark wind blow ing from my future i had been shouti ng so m uch that i’d lost my breath and just then the jailers rushed in and started trying to release th e chaplain from my grip one of them mad e as if to strike me th e chaplain quietened them down then gazed at me for a m oment without speaking i could see tears in his eyes then he turned and left the cell once he’d gone i felt calm ag ain but all this exciteme nt had exhaus ted m e and i dropped heavily on t o my sleeping plank i must have had a l ongish sle ep for when i woke the stars were shining down on m y face sounds of th e count ryside came faintly in and the cool night air veined with sm ells’ of earth and salt fanned my cheeks the m arvelous p eace of the sleepbound summer night floode d through me like a tide then just on the edge of daybr eak i heard a steamer’s siren people were starting on a voyage to a world which had ce ased to concern me forever alm ost for the first time in many m onths i thought of m y mother and now it seemed to m e i understood why at her life’s end she had ta ken on a “fiancé” why she’d played at making a fresh start there to o in that home where lives were flick ering out the dusk came as a m ournful sol ace with deat h so near mother m ust have felt like someone on the brink of freedom ready to star t life all over again no one no one i n the world had any right to weep for her a nd i too felt ready to start life all over again it was as if that great rush of a nger had washed me clea n em ptied me of hope and gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars for the first tim e the first i laid m y heart open to the benign indi fference of the universe to feel it so lik e myself indeed so brotherly made me r ealize that i’d been happy and that i was happy still for all to be acco mplished for m e to feel less lonely all that remained to hope was that on the day of m y execution th ere should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration the end
