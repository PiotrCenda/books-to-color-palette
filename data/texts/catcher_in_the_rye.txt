if you really want to hear about it the first thing youll probably want to know is where i was born an what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me and all that david copperfield kind of crap but i dont feel like going into it if you want to know the truth in the first place that stuff bores me and in the second place my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if i told anything pretty personal about them theyre quite touchy about anything like that especially my father theyre nice and allim not saying thatbut theyre also touchy as hell besides im not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything ill just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last christmas just before i got pretty rundown and had to come out here and take it easy i mean thats all i told db about and hes my brother and all hes in hollywood that isnt too far from this crumby place and he comes over and visits me practically every week end hes going to drive me home when i go home next month maybe he just got a jaguar one of those little english jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour it cost him damn near four thousand bucks hes got a lot of dough now he didnt use to he used to be just a regular writer when he was home he wrote this terrific book of short stories the secret goldfish in case you never heard of him the best one in it was the secret goldfish it was about this little kid that wouldnt let anybody look at his goldfish because hed bought it with his own money it killed me now hes out in hollywood db being a prostitute if theres one thing i hate its the movies dont even mention them to me where i want to start telling is the day i left pencey prep pencey prep is this school thats in agerstown pennsylvania you probably heard of it youve probably seen the ads anyway they advertise in about a thousand magazines always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence like as if all you ever did at pencey was play polo all the time i never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place and underneath the guy on the horses picture it always says since we have been molding boys into splendid clearthinking young men strictly for the birds they dont do any damn more molding at pencey than they do at any other school and i didnt know anybody there that was splendid and clearthinking and all maybe two guys if that many and they probably came to pencey that way anyway it was the saturday of the football game with saxon hall the game with saxon hall was supposed to be a very big deal around pencey it was the last game of the year and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old pencey didnt win i remember around three oclock that afternoon i was standing way the hell up on top of thomsen hill right next to this crazy cannon that was in the revolutionary war and all you could see the whole field from there and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place you couldnt see the grandstand too hot but you could hear them all yelling deep and terrific on the pencey side because practically the whole school except me was there and scrawny and faggy on the saxon hall side because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them there were never many girls at all at the football games only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them it was a terrible school no matter how you looked at it i like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while even if theyre only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something old selma thurmershe was the headmasters daughtershowed up at the games quite often but she wasnt exactly the type that drove you mad with desire she was a pretty nice girl though i sat next to her once in the bus from agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation i liked her she had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedylooking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place but you felt sort of sorry for her what i liked about her she didnt give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her fa ther was she probably knew what a phony slob he was the reason i was standing way up on thomsen hill instead of down at the game was because id just got back from new york with the fencing team i was the goddam manager of the fencing team very big deal wed gone in to new york that morning for this fencing meet with mcburney school only we didnt have the meet i left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway it wasnt all my fault i had to keep getting up to look at this map so wed know where to get off so we got back to pencey around twothirty instead of around dinnertime the whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train it was pretty funny in a way the other reason i wasnt down at the game was because i was on my way to say goodby to old spencer my history teacher he had the grippe and i figured i probably wouldnt see him again till christmas vacation started he wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before i went home he knew i wasnt coming back to pencey i forgot to tell you about that they kicked me out i wasnt supposed to come back after christmas vacation on account of i was flunking four subj ects and not applying myself and all they gave me frequent warning to start applying myselfespecially around midterms when my parents came up for a conference with old thurmerbut i didnt do it so i got the ax they give guys the ax quite frequently at pencey it has a very good academic rating pencey it really does anyway it was december and all and it was cold as a witchs teat especially on top of that stupid hill i only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything the week before that somebodyd stolen my camelshair coat right out of my room with my fur lined gloves right in the pocket and all pencey was full of crooks quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families but it was full of crooks anyway the more expensive a school is the more crooks it hasim not kidding anyway i kept standing next to that crazy cannon looking down at the game and freezing my ass off only i wasnt watching the game too much what i was really hanging around for i was trying to feel some kind of a goodby i mean ive left schools and places i didnt even know i was leaving them i hate that i dont care if its a sad goodby or a bad goodby but when i leave a place i like to know im leaving it if you dont you feel even worse i was lucky all of a sudden i thought of something that helped make me know i was getting the hell out i suddenly remembered this time in around october that i and robert tichener and paul campbell were chucking a football around in front of the academic building they were nice guys especially tichener it was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out but we kept chucking the ball around anyway it kept getting darker and darker and we could hardly see the ball any more but we didnt want to stop doing what we were doing finally we had to this teacher that taught biology mr zambesi stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner if i get a chance to remember that kind of stuff i can get a goodby when i need oneat least most of the time i can as soon as i got it i turned around and started running down the other side of the hill toward old spencers house he didnt live on the campus he lived on anthony wayne avenue i ran all the way to the main gate and then i waited a second till i got my breath i have no wind if you want to know the truth im quite a heavy smoker for one thingthat is i used to be they made me cut it out another thing i grew six and a half inches last year thats also how i practically got tb and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff im pretty healthy though anyway as soon as i got my breath back i ran across route it was icy as hell and i damn near fell down i dont even know what i was running fori guess i just felt like it after i got across the road i felt like i was sort of disappearing it was that kind of a crazy afternoon terrifically cold and no sun out or anything and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road boy i rang that doorbell fast when i got to old spencers house i was really frozen my ears were hurting and i could hardly move my fingers at all cmon cmon i said right out loud almost somebody open the door finally old mrs spencer opened it they didnt have a maid or anything and they always opened the door themselves they didnt have too much dough holden mrs spencer said how lovely to see you come in dear are you frozen to death i think she was glad to see me she liked me at least i think she did boy did i get in that house fast how are you mrs spencer i said hows mr spencer let me take your coat dear she said she didnt hear me ask her how mr spencer was she was sort of deaf she hung up my coat in the hall closet and i sort of brushed my hair back with my hand i wear a crew cut quite frequently and i never have to comb it much howve you been mrs spencer i said again only louder so shed hear me ive been just fine holden she closed the closet door how have you been the way she asked me i knew right away old spencerd told her id been kicked out fine i said hows mr spencer he over his grippe yet over it holden hes behaving like a perfecti dont know what hes in his room dear go right in they each had their own room and all they were both around seventy years old or even more than that they got a bang out of things thoughin a haifassed way of course i know that sounds mean to say but i dont mean it mean i just mean that i used to think about old spencer quite a lot and if you thought about him too much you wondered what the heck he was still living for i mean he was all stooped over and he had very terrible posture and in class whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him thats awful in my opinion but if you thought about him just enough and not too much you could figure it out that he wasnt doing too bad for himself for instance one sunday when some other guys and i were over there for hot chocolate he showed us this old beatup navajo blanket that he and mrs spencerd bought off some indian in yellowstone park you could tell old spencer d got a big bang out of buying it thats what i mean you take somebody old as hell like old spencer and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket his door was open but i sort of knocked on it anyway just to be polite and all i could see where he was sitting he was sitting in a big leather chair all wrapped up in that blanket i just told you about he looked over at me when i knocked whos that he yelled caulfield come in boy he was al ways yelling outside class it got on your nerves sometimes the minute i went in i was sort of sorry id come he was reading the atlantic monthly and there were pills and medicine all over the place and everything smelled like vicks nose drops it was pretty depressing im not too crazy about sick people anyway what made it even more depressing old spencer had on this very sad ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something i dont much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway their bumpy old chests are always showing and their legs old guys legs at beaches and places always look so white and unhairy hello sir i said i got your note thanks a lot hed written me this note asking me to stop by and say goodby before vacation started on account of i wasnt coming back you didnt have to do all that id have come over to say goodby anyway have a seat there boy old spencer said he meant the bed i sat down on it hows your grippe sir mboy if i felt any better id have to send for the doctor old spencer said that knocked him out he started chuckling like a madman then he finally straightened himself out and said why arent you down at the game i thought this was the day of the big game it is i was only i just got back from new york with the fencing team i said boy his bed was like a rock he started getting serious as hell i knew he would so youre leaving us eh he said yes sir i guess i am he started going into this nodding routine you never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old spencer did you never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all or just because he was a nice old guy that didnt know his ass from his elbow what did dr thurmer say to you boy i understand you had quite a little chat yes we did we really did i was in his office for around two hours i guess whatd he say to you oh well about life being a game and all and how you should play it according to the rules he was pretty nice about it i mean he didnt hit the ceiling or anything he just kept talking about li fe being a game and all you know life is a game boy life is a game that one plays according to the rules yes sir i know it is i know it game my ass some game if you get on the side where all the hotshots are then its a game all rightill admit that but if you get on the other side where there arent any hotshots then whats a game about it nothing no game has dr thurmer written to your parents yet old spencer asked me he said he was going to write them monday have you yourself communicated with them no sir i havent communicated with them because ill probably see them wednesday night when i get home and how do you think theyll take the news well theyll be pretty irritated about it i said they really will this is about the fourth school ive gone to i shook my head i shake my head quite a lot boy i said i also say boy quite a lot partly because i have a lousy vocabulary and partly because i act quite young for my age sometimes i was sixteen then and im seventeen now and sometimes i act like im about thirteen its really ironical because im six foot two and a half and i have gray hair i really do the one side of my headthe right sideis full of millions of gray hairs ive had them ever since i was a kid and yet i still act sometimes like i was only about twelve everybody says that especially my father its partly true too but it isnt all true people always think somethings all true i dont give a damn except that i get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age sometimes i act a lot older than i ami really dobut people never notice it people never notice anything old spencer started nodding again he also started picking his nose he made out like he was only pinching it but he was really getting the old thumb right in there i guess he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room i didnt care except that its pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose then he said i had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had their little chat with dr thurmer some weeks ago theyre grand people yes they are theyre very nice grand theres a word i really hate its a phony i could puke every time i hear it then all of a sudden old spencer looked like he had something very good something sharp as a tack to say to me he sat up more in his chair and sort of moved around it was a false alarm though all he did was lift the atlantic monthly off his lap and try to chuck it on the bed next to me he missed it was only about two inches away but he missed anyway i got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed all of a sudden then i wanted to get the hell out of the room i could feel a terrific lecture coming on i didnt mind the idea so much but i didnt feel like being lectured to and smell vicks nose drops and look at old spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time i really didnt it started all right whats the matter with you boy old spencer said he said it pretty tough too for him how many subjects did you carry this term five sir five and how many are you failing in four i moved my ass a little bit on the bed it was the hardest bed i ever sat on i passed english all right i said because i had all that beowulf and lord randal my son stuff when i was at the whooton school i mean i didnt have to do any work in english at all hardly except write compositions once in a while he wasnt even listening he hardly ever listened to you when you said something i flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing i know that sir boy i know it you couldnt help it absolutely nothing he said over again thats something that drives me crazy when people say something twice that way after you admit it the first time then he said it three times but absolutely nothing i doubt very much if you opened your textbook even once the whole term did you tell the truth boy well i sort of glanced through it a couple of times i told him i didnt want to hurt his feelings he was mad about history you glanced through it eh he saidvery sarcastic your ah exam paper is over there on top of my chiffonier on top of the pile bring it here please it was a very dirty trick but i went over and brought it over to himi didnt have any alternative or anything then i sat down on his cement bed again boy you cant imagine how sorry i was getting that id stopped by to say goodby to him he started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something we studied the egyptians from november th to december nd he said you chose to write about them for the optional essay question would you care to hear what you had to say no sir not very much i said he read it anyway though you cant stop a teacher when they want to do something they just do it the egyptians were an ancient race of caucasians residing in one of the northern sections of africa the latter as we all know is the largest continent in the eastern hemisphere i had to sit there and listen to that crap it certainly was a dirty trick the egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for various reasons modern science would still like to know what the secret ingredients were that the egyptians used when they wrapped up dead people so that their faces would not rot for innumerable centuries this interesting riddle is still quite a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century he stopped reading and put my paper down i was beginning to sort of hate him your essay shall we say ends there he said in this very sarcastic voice you wouldnt think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all however you dropped me a little note at the bottom of the page he said i know i did i said i said it very fast because i wanted to stop him before he started reading that out loud but you couldnt stop him he was hot as a firecracker dear mr spencer he read out loud that is all i know about the egyptians i cant seem to get very interested in them although your lectures are very interesting it is all right with me if you flunk me though as i am flunking everything else except english anyway respectfully yours holden caulfield he put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like hed just beaten hell out of me in pingpong or something i dont think ill ever forgive him for reading me that crap out loud i wouldntve read it out loud to him if hed written iti really wouldnt in the first place id only written that damn note so that he wouldnt feel too bad about flunking me do you blame me for flunking you boy he said no sir i certainly dont i said i wished to hell hed stop calling me boy all the time he tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it only he missed again naturally i had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the atlantic monthly its boring to do that every two minutes what would you have done in my place he said tell the truth boy well you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me so i shot the bull for a while i told him i was a real moron and all that stuff i told him how i wouldve done exactly the same thing if id been in his place and how most people didnt appreciate how tough it is being a teacher that kind of stuff the old bull the funny thing is though i was sort of thinking of something else while i shot the bull i live in new york and i was thinking about the lagoon in central park down near central park south i was wondering if it would be frozen over when i got home and if it was where did the ducks go i was wondering where the ducks went when the lagoon got all icy and frozen over i wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them away to a zoo or something or if they just flew away im lucky though i mean i could shoot the old bull to old spencer and think about those ducks at the same time its funny you dont have to think too hard when you talk to a teacher all of a sudden though he interrupted me while i was shooting the bull he was always interrupting you how do you feel about all this boy id be very interested to know very interested you mean about my flunking out of pencey and all i said i sort of wished hed cover up his bumpy chest it wasnt such a beautiful view if im not mistaken i believe you also had some difficulty at the whooton school and at elkton hills he didnt say it just sarcastic but sort of nasty too i didnt have too much difficulty at elkton hills i told him i didnt exactly flunk out or anything i just quit sort of why may i ask why oh well its a long story sir i mean its pretty complicated i didnt feel like going into the whole thing with him he wouldnt have understood it anyway it wasnt up his alley at all one of the biggest reasons i left elkton hills was because i was surrounded by phonies thats all they were coming in the goddam window for instance they had this headmaster mr haas that was the phoniest bastard i ever met in my life ten times worse than old thurmer on sundays for instance old haas went around shaking hands with everybodys parents when they drove up to school hed be charming as hell and all except if some boy had little old funnylooking parents you shouldve seen the way he did with my roommates parents i mean if a boys mother was sort of fat or cornylooking or something and if somebodys father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny blackandwhite shoes then old hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then hed go talk for maybe a half an hour with somebody elses parents i cant stand that stuff it drives me crazy it makes me so depressed i go crazy i hated that goddam elkton hills old spencer asked me something then but i didnt hear him i was thinking about old haas what sir i said do you have any particular qualms about leaving pencey oh i have a few qualms all right sure but not too many not yet anyway i guess it hasnt really hit me yet it takes things a while to hit me all im doing right now is thinking about going home wednesday im a moron do you feel absolutely no concern for your future boy oh i feel some concern for my future all right sure sure i do i thought about it for a minute but not too much i guess not too much i guess you will old spencer said you w ill boy you will when its too late i didnt like hearing him say that it made me sound dead or something it was very depressing i guess i will i said id like to put some sense in that head of yours boy im trying to help you im trying to help you if i can he really was too you could see that but it was just that we were too much on opposite sides ot the pole thats all i know you are sir i said thanks a lot no kidding i appreciate it i really do i got up from the bed then boy i couldntve sat there another ten minutes to save my life the thing is though i have to get going now i have quite a bit of equipment at the gym i have to get to take home with me i really do he looked up at me and started nodding again with this very serious look on his face i felt sorry as hell for him all of a sudden but i just couldnt hang around there any longer the way we were on opposite sides of the pole and the way he kept missing the bed whenever he chucked something at it and his sad old bathrobe with his chest showing and that grippy smell of vicks nose drops all over the place look sir dont worry about me i said i mean it ill be all right im just going through a phase right now everybody goes through phases and all dont they i dont know boy i dont know i hate it when somebody answers that way sure sure they do i said i mean it sir please dont worry about me i sort of put my hand on his shoulder okay i said wouldnt you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go mrs spencer would be i would i really would but the thing is i have to get going i have to go right to the gym thanks though thanks a lot sir then we shook hands and all that crap it made me feel sad as hell though ill drop you a line sir take care of your grippe now goodby boy after i shut the door and started back to the living room he yelled something at me but i couldnt exactly hear him im pretty sure he yelled good luck at me i hope to hell not id never yell good luck at anybody it sounds terrible when you think about it im the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life its awful if im on my way to the store to buy a magazine even and somebody asks me where im going im liable to say im going to the opera its terrible so when i told old spencer i had to go to the gym and get my equipment and stuff that was a sheer lie i dont even keep my goddam equipment in the gym where i lived at pencey i lived in the ossenburger memorial wing of the new dorms it was only for juniors and seniors i was a junior my roommate was a senior it was named after this guy ossenburger that went to pencey he made a pot of dough in the undertaking business after he got out of pencey what he did he started these undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family buried for about five bucks apiece you should see old ossenburger he probably just shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river anyway he gave pencey a pile of dough and they named our wing alter him the first football game of the year he came up to school in this big goddam cadillac and we all had to stand up in the grandstand and give him a locomotivethats a cheer then the next morning in chapel be made a speech that lasted about ten hours he started off with about fifty corny jokes just to show us what a regular guy he was very big deal then he started telling us how he was never ashamed when he was in some kind of trouble or something to get right down his knees and pray to god he told us we should always pray to godtalk to him and allwherever we were he told us we ought to think of jesus as our buddy and all he said he talked to jesus all the time even when he was driving his car that killed me i just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking jesus to send him a few more stiffs the only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it he was telling us all about what a swell guy he was what a hotshot and all then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me edgar marsalla laid this terrific fart it was a very crude thing to do in chapel and all but it was also quite amusing old marsalla he damn near blew the roof off hardly anybody laughed out loud and old ossenburger made out like he didnt even hear it but old thurmer the headmaster was sitting right next to him on the rostrum and all and you could tell he heard it boy was he sore he didnt say anything then but the next night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic building and he came up and made a speech he said that the boy that had created the disturbance in chapel wasnt fit to go to pencey we tried to get old marsalla to rip off another one right while old thurmer was making his speech but be wasnt in the right mood anyway thats where i lived at pencey old ossenburger memorial wing in the new dorms it was pretty nice to get back to my room after i left old spencer because everybody was down at the game and the heat was on in our room for a change it felt sort of cosy i took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar and then i put on this hat that id bought in new york that morning it was this red hunting hat with one of those very very long peaks i saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway just after i noticed id lost all the goddam foils it only cost me a buck the way i wore it i swung the old peak way around to the backvery corny ill admit but i liked it that way i looked good in it that way then i got this book i was reading and sat down in my chair there were two chairs in every room i had one and my roommate ward stradlater had one the arms were in sad shape because everybody was always sitting on them but they were pretty comfortable chairs the book i was reading was this book i took out of the library by mistake they gave me the wrong book and i didnt notice it till i got back to my room they gave me out of africa by isak dinesen i thought it was going to stink but it didnt it was a very good book im quite illiterate but i read a lot my favorite author is my brother db and my next favorite is ring lardner my brother gave me a book by ring lardner for my birthday just before i went to pencey it had these very funny crazy plays in it and then it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl thats always speeding only hes married the cop so be cant marry her or anything then this girl gets killed because shes always speeding that story just about killed me what i like best is a book thats at least funny once in a while i read a lot of classical books like the return of the native and all and i like them and i read a lot of war books and mysteries and all but they dont knock me out too much what really knocks me out is a book that when youre all done reading it you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it that doesnt happen much though i wouldnt mind calling this isak dinesen up and ring lardner except that db told me hes dead you take that book of human bondage by somerset maugham though i read it last summer its a pretty good book and all but i wouldnt want to call somerset maugham up i dont know he just isnt the kind of guy id want to call up thats all id rather call old thomas hardy up i like that eustacia vye anyway i put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book out of africa id read it already but i wanted to read certain parts over again id only read about three pages though when i heard somebody coming through the shower curtains even without looking up i knew right away w ho it was it was robert ackley this guy that roomed right next to me there was a shower right between every two rooms in our wing and about eightyfive times a day old ac kley barged in on me he was probably the only guy in the whole dorm besides me that wasnt down at the game he hardly ever went anywhere he was a very peculiar guy he was a senior and hed been at pencey the whole four years and all but nobody ever called him anything except ackley not even herb gale his own roommate ever called him bob or even ack if he ever gets married his own wifell probably call him ackley he was one of these very very tall roundshouldered guyshe was about six fourwith lousy teeth the whole time he roomed next to me i never even once saw him brush his teeth they always looked mossy and awful and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room with his mouth full of mashed potatoes and peas or something besides that he had a lot of pimples not just on his forehead or his chin like most guys but all over his whole face and not only that he had a terrible personality he was also sort of a nasty guy i wasnt too crazy about him to tell you the truth i could feel him standing on the shower ledge right behind my chair taking a look to see if stradlater was around he hated stradlaters guts and he never came in the room if stradlater was around he hated everybodys guts damn near he came down off the shower ledge and came in the room hi he said he always said it like he was terrifically bored or terrifically tired he didnt want you to think he was visiting you or anything he wanted you to think hed come in by mistake for gods sake hi i said but i didnt look up from my book with a guy like ackley if you looked up from your book you were a goner you were a goner anyway but not as quick if you didnt look up right away he started walking around the room very slow and all the way he always did picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier he always picked up your personal stuff and looked at it boy could he get on your nerves sometimes how was the fencing he said he just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying myself he didnt give a damn about the fencing we win or what he said nobody won i said without looking up though what he said he always made you say everything twice nobody won i said i sneaked a look to see what he was fiddling around with on my chiffonier he was looking at this pictur e of this girl i used to go around with in new york sally hayes he mustve picked up that goddam picture and looked at it at least five thousand times since i got it he always put it back in the wrong place too when he was finished he did it on purpose you could tell nobody won he said how come i left the goddam foils and stuff on the subway i still didnt look up at him on the subway for chrissake ya lost them ya mean we got on the wrong subway i had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map on the wall he came over and stood right in my light hey i said ive read this same sentence about twenty times since you came in anybody else except ackley wouldve taken the goddam hint not him though think theyll make ya pay for em he said i dont know and i dont give a damn how bout sitting down or something ackley kid youre right in my goddam light he didnt like it when you called him ackley kid he was always telling me i was a goddam kid because i was sixteen and he was eighteen it drove him mad when i called him ackley kid he kept standing there he was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldnt get out of your light when you asked him to hed do it finally but it took him a lot longer if you asked him to what the hellya reading he said goddam book he shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it any good he said this sentence im reading is terrific i can be quite sarcastic when im in the mood he didnt get it though he started walking around the room again picking up all my personal stuff and stradlaters fi nally i put my book down on the floor you couldnt read anything with a guy like ackley around it was impossible i slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old ackley making himself at home i was feeling sort of tired from the trip to new york and all and i started yawning then i started horsing around a little bit sometimes i horse around quite a lot just to keep from getting bored what i did was i pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around to the front then pulled it way down over my eyes that way i couldnt see a goddam thing i think im going blind i said in this very hoarse voice mother darling everythings getting so dark in here youre nuts i swear to god ackley said mother darling give me your hand why wont you give me your hand for chrissake grow up i started groping around in front of me like a blind guy but without getting up or anything i kept saying mother darling w hy wont you give me your hand i was only horsing around naturally that stuff gives me a bang sometimes besides i know it annoyed hell out of old ackley he always brought out the old sadist in me i was pretty sadistic with him quite often finally i quit though i pulled the peak around to the back again and relaxed who belongsa this ackley said he was holding my roommates knee supporter up to show me that guy ackleyd pick up anything hed even pick up your jock strap or something i told him it was stradlaters so he chucked it on stradlaters bed he got it off stradlaters chiffonier so he chucked it on the bed he came over and sat down on the arm of stradlaters chair he never sat down in a chair just always on the arm where the hellja get that hat he said new york how much a buck you got robbed he started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a match he was always cleaning his fingernails it was funny in a way his teeth were always mossylooking and his ears were always dirty as hell but he was always cleaning his fingernails i guess he thought that made him a very neat guy he took another look at my hat while he was cleaning them up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in for chrissake he said thats a deer shooting hat like hell it is i took it off and looked at it i sort of closed one eye like i was taking aim at it this is a people shooting hat i said i shoot people in this hat your folks know you got kicked out yet nope where the hells stradlater at anyway

stradlaters tennis racketi n its wooden press and allfell right on my head it made a big clunk and it hurt like hell it damn near killed old ackley though he started laughing in this very high falsetto voice he kept laughing the whole time i was taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him something like thata guy getting hit on the head with a rock or somethingtickled the pants off ackley you have a damn good sense of humor ackley kid i told him you know that i handed him the scissors lemme be your manager ill get you on the goddam radio i sat down in my chair again and he started cutting his big hor nylooking nails how bout using the table or something i said cut em over the table willya i dont feel like walking on your crumby nails in my bare feet tonight he kept right on cutting them over the floor though what lousy manners i mean it whos stradlaters date he said he was always keeping tabs on who stradlater was dating even though he hated stradlaters guts i dont know why no reason boy i cant stand that sonuvab itch hes one sonuvabitch i really cant stand hes crazy about you he told me he thinks youre a goddam prince i said i call people a prince quite often when im horsing around it keeps me from getting bored or something hes got this superior attitude all the time ackley said i just cant stand the sonuvabitch youd think he do you mind cutting your nails over the tabl e hey i said ive asked you about fifty hes got this goddam superior attitude all the time ackley said i dont even think the sonuvabitch is intelligent he thinks he is he thinks hes about the most ackley for chrissake willya please cut your crumby nails over the table ive asked you fifty times he started cutting his nails over the table for a change the only way he ever did anything was if you yelled at him i watched him for a while then i said the reason youre sore at stradlater is because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while he didnt mean to insult you for cryin out loud he didnt say it right or anything but he didnt mean anything insulting all he meant was youd look better and feel better if you sort of brushed your teeth once in a while i brush my teeth dont gimme that no you dont ive seen you and you dont i said i didnt say it nasty though i felt sort of sorry for him in a way i mean it isnt too nice naturally if somebody tells you you dont brush your teeth stradlaters all right hes not too bad i said you dont know him thats the trouble i still say hes a sonuvabitch hes a conceited sonuvabitch hes conceited but hes very generous in some things he really is i said look suppose for instance stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you liked say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lotim just giving you an example now you know what hed do hed probably take it off and give it ta you he really would oryou know what hed do hed leave it on your bed or something but hed give you the goddam tie most guys would probably just hell ackley said if i had his dough i would too no you wouldnt i shook my head no you wouldnt ackley kid if you had his dough youd be one of the biggest stop calling me ackley kid god damn it im old enough to be your lousy father no youre not boy he could really be aggravating sometimes he never missed a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen in the first place i wouldnt let you in my goddam family i said well just cut out calling me all of a sudden the door opened and old stradlater barged in in a big hurry he was always in a big hurry everything was a very big deal he came over to me and gave me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheekswhich is something that can be very annoying listen he said you going out anywheres special tonight i dont know i might what the hells it doing outsnowing he had snow all over his coat yeah listen if youre not going out anyplace special how bout lending me your houndstooth jacket who won the game i said its only the half were leaving stradlater said no kidding you gonna use your houndstooth tonight or not i spilled some crap all over my gray flannel no but i dont want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all i said we were practically the same heighth but he weighed about twice as much as i did he had these very broad shoulders i wont stretch it he went over to the closet in a big hurry howsa boy ackley he said to ackley he was at least a pretty friendly guy stradlater it was partly a phony kind of friendly but at least he always said hello to ackley and all ackley just sort of grunted when he said howsa boy he wouldnt answer him but he didnt have guts enough not to at least grunt then he said to me i think ill get going see ya later okay i said he never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own room old stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all i think maybe ill take a fast shave he said he had a pretty heavy beard he really did wheres your date i asked him shes waiting in the annex he went out of the room with his toilet kit and towel under his arm no shirt on or anything he always walked around in his bare torso because he thought he had a damn good build he did too i have to admit it i didnt have anything special to do so i went down to the can and chewed the rag with him while he was shaving we were the only ones in the can because everybody was still down at the game it was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy there were about ten washbowls all right against the wall stradlater had the middle one i sat down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and offthis nervous habit i have stradlater kept whistling song of india while he shaved he had one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune and he always picked out some song thats hard to whistle even if youre a good whistler like song of india or slaughter on tenth avenue he could really mess a song up you remember i said before that ackley was a slob in his personal habits well so was stradlater but in a different way stradlater was more of a secret slob he always looked all right stradlater but for instance you shouldve seen the razor he shaved himself with it was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap he never cleaned it or anything he always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up but he was a secret slob anyway if you knew him the way i did the reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself he thought he was the handsomest guy in the western hemisphere he was pretty handsome tooill admit it but he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his picture in your year book theyd right away say whos this boy i mean he was mostly a year book kind of handsome guy i knew a lot of guys at pencey i thought were a lot handsomer than stradlater but they wouldnt look handsome if you saw their pictures in the year book theyd look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out ive had that experience frequently anyway i was sitting on the washbowl next to where stradlater was shaving sort of turning the water on and off i still had my red hunting hat on with the peak around to the back and all i really got a bang out of that hat hey stradlater said wanna do me a big favor what i said not too enthusiastic he was always asking you to do him a big favor you take a very handsome guy or a guy that thinks hes a real hotshot and theyre always asking you to do them a big favor just because theyre crazy about themseif they think youre crazy about them too and that youre just dying to do them a favor its sort of funny in a way you goin out tonight he said i might i might not i dont know why i got about a hundred pages to read for history for monday he said how bout writing a composition for me for english ill be up the creek if i dont get the goddam thing in by monday the reason i ask how bout it it was very ironical it really was im the one thats flunking out of the goddam place and youre asking me to write you a goddam composition i said yeah i know the thing is though ill be up the creek if i dont get it in be a buddy be a buddyroo okay i didnt answer him right away suspense is good for some bastards like stradlater what on i said anything anything descriptive a room or a house or something you once lived in or something you know just as long as its descriptive as hell he gave out a big yawn while he said that which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass i mean if somebody yawns right while theyre asking you to do them a goddam favor just dont do it too good is all he said that sonuvabitch hartzell thinks youre a hotshot in english and he knows youre my roommate so i mean dont stick all the commas and stuff in the right place thats something else that gives me a royal pain i mean if youre good at writing compositions and somebody starts talking about commas stradlater was always doing that he wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place he was a little bit like ackley that way i once sat next to ackley at this basketball game we had a terrific guy on the team howie coyle that could sink them fr om the middle of the floor without even touching the backboard or anything ackley kept saying the whole goddam game that coyle had a perfect build for basketball god how i hate that stuff i got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while so i backed up a few feet and started doing this tap dance just for the hell of it i was just amusing myself i cant really tapdance or anything but it was a stone floor in the can and it was good for tapdancing i started imitating one of those guys in the movies in one of those musicals i hate the movies like poison but i get a bang imitating them old stradlater watched me in the mirror while he was shaving all i needs an audience im an exhibitionist im the goddarn governors son i said i was knocking myself out tapdancing all over the place he doesnt want me to be a tap dancer he wants me to go to oxford but its in my goddam blood tapdancing old stradlater laughed he didnt have too bad a sense of humor its the opening night of the ziegfeld follies i was getting out of breath i have hardly any wind at all the leading man cant go on hes drunk as a bastard so who do they get to take his place me thats who the little ole goddam governors son wheredja get that hat stradlater said he meant my hunting hat hed never seen it before i was out of breath anyway so i quit horsing around i took off my hat and looked at it for about the ninetieth time i got it in new york this morning for a buck ya like it stradlater nodded sharp he said he was only flattering me though because right away he said listen are ya gonna write that composition for me i have to know if i get the time i will if i dont i wont i said i went over and sat down at the washbowl next to him again whos your date i asked him fitzgerald hell no i told ya im through with that pig yeah give her to me boy no kidding shes my type take her shes too old for you all of a suddenfor no good reason really except that i was sort of in the mood for horsing aroundi felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old stradlater in a half nelson thats a wrestling hold in case you dont know where you get the other guy around the neck and choke him to death if you feel like it so i did it i landed on him like a goddam panther cut it out holden for chrissake stra dlater said he didnt feel like horsing around he was shaving and all wuddaya wanna make me docut my goddam head off i didnt let go though i had a pretty good half nelson on him liberate yourself from my viselike grip i said jesus christ he put down his razor and all of a sudden jerked his arms up and sort of broke my hold on him he was a very strong guy im a very weak guy now cut out the crap he said he started shavi ng himself all over again he always shaved himself twice to look gorgeous with his crumby old razor who is your date if it isnt fitzgerald i asked him i sat down on the washbowl next to him again that phyllis smith babe no it was supposed to he but the arrangements got all screwed up i got bud thaws girls roommate now hey i almost forgot she knows you who does i said my date yeah i said whats her name i was pretty interested im thinking uh jean gallagher boy i nearly dropped dead when he said that jane gallagher i said i even got up from the washbowl when he said that i damn near dropped dead youre damn right i know her she practically lived right next door to me the summer before last she had this big damn doberman pinscher thats how i met her her dog used to keep coming over in our youre right in my light holden for chrissake stradlater said ya have to stand right there boy was i excited though i really was where is she i asked him i oughta go down and say hello to her or something where is she in the annex yeah howd she happen to mention me does she go to bm now she said she might go there she said she might go to shipley too i thought she went to shipley howd she happen to mention me i was pretty excited i really was i dont know for chrissake lift up willya youre on my towel stradlater said i was sitting on his stupid towel jane gallagher i said i couldnt get over it jesus h christ old stradlater was putting vitalis on his hair my vitalis shes a dancer i said ballet and all she used to practice about two hours every day right in the middle of the hottest w eather and all she was worried that it might make her legs lousyall thick and all i used to play checkers with her all the time you used to play what with her all the time checkers checkers for chrissake yeah she wouldnt move any of her kings what shed do when shed get a king she wouldnt move it shed just leave it in the back row shed get them all lined up in the back row then shed never use them she just liked the way they looked when they were all in the back row stradlater didnt say anything that kind of stuff doesnt interest most people her mother belonged to the same club we did i said i used to caddy once in a while just to make some dough i caddyd for her mother a couple of times she went around in about a hundred and seventy for nine holes stradlater wasnt hardly listening he was combing his gorgeous locks i oughta go down and at least say hello to her i said why dontcha i will in a minute he started parting his hair all over agai n it took him about an hour to comb his hair her mother and father were divorced her mother was married again to some booze hound i said skinny guy with hairy legs i remember him he wore shorts all the time jane said he was supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing but all i ever saw him do was booze all the time and listen to every single goddam mystery program on the radio and run around the goddam house naked with jane around and all yeah stradlater said that really interested him about the booze hound running around the house naked with jane around stradlater was a very sexy bastard she had a lousy childhood im not kidding that didnt interest stradlater though only very sexy stuff interested him jane gallagher jesus i couldnt get her off my mind i really couldnt i oughta go down and say hello to her at least why the hell dontcha instead of keep saying it stradlater said i walked over to the window but you couldnt see out of it it was so steamy from all the heat in the can im not in the mood right now i said i wasnt either you have to be in the mood for those things i thought she went to shipley i couldve sworn she went to shipley i walked around the can for a little while i didnt have anything else to do did she enjoy the game i said yeah i guess so i dont know did she tell you we used to play checkers all the time or anything i dont know for chrissake i only just met her stradlater said he was finished combing his goddam gorgeous hair he was putting away all his crumby toilet articles listen give her my regards willya okay stradlater said but i knew he probably wouldnt you take a guy like stradlater they never give your regards to people he went back to the room but i stuck around in the can for a while thinking about old jane then i went back to the room too stradlater was putting on his tie in front of the mirror when i got there he spent around half his goddam life in front of the mirro r i sat down in my chair and sort of watched him for a while hey i said dont tell her i got kicked out willya okay that was one good thing about stradlater you didnt have to explain every goddam little thing with him the way you had to do with ackley mostly i guess because he wasnt too interested thats r eally why ackley it was different ackley was a very nosy bastard he put on my houndstooth jacket jesus now try not to stretch it all over the place i said id only worn it about twice i wont where the hells my cigarettes on the desk he never knew where he left anything under your muffler he put them in his coat pocketmy coat pocket i pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden for a change i was getting sort of nervous all of a sudden im quite a nervous guy listen where ya going on your date with her i asked him ya know yet i dont know new york if we have time she only signed out for ninethirty for chrissake i didnt like the way he said it so i said the reason she did that she probably just didnt know what a handsome charming bastard you are if shed known she probably wouldve signed out for ninethirty in the morning goddam right stradlater said you couldnt rile him too easily he was too conceited no kidding now do that composition for me he said he had his coat on and he was all ready to go dont knock yourself out or anything but just make it descriptive as hell okay i didnt answer him i didnt feel like it all i said was ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row okay stradlater said but i knew he wouldnt take it easy now he banged the hell out of the room i sat there for about a half hour after he left i mean i just sat in my chair not doing anything i kept thinking about jane and about stradlater having a date with her and all it made me so nervous i nearly went crazy i already told you what a sexy bastard stradlater was all of a sudden ackley barged back in again through the damn shower curtains as usual for once in my stupid life i was really glad to see him he took my mind off the other stuff he stuck around till around dinnertime talking about all the guys at pencey that he hated their guts and squeezing this big pimple on his chin he didnt even use his handkerchief i dont even think the bastard had a handkerchief if you want to know the truth i never saw him use one anyway we always had the same meal on saturday nights at pencey it was supposed to be a big deal because they gave you steak ill bet a thousand bucks the reason they did that was because a lot of guys parents came up to school on sunday and old thurmer probably figured everybodys mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner last night and hed say steak what a rack et you shouldve seen the steaks they were these little hard dry jobs that you could hardly even cut you always got these very lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night and for dessert you got brown betty which nobody ate except maybe the little kids in the lower school that didnt know any better and guys like ackley that ate everything it was nice though when we got out of the dining room there were about three inches of snow on the ground and it was still coming down like a madman it looked pretty as hell and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the place it was very childish but everybody was really enjoying themselves i didnt have a date or anything so i and this friend of mine mal brossard that was on the wrestling team decided wed take a bus into agerstown and have a hamburger and maybe see a lousy movie neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night i asked mal if he minded if ackley came along with us the reason i asked was because ackley never did anything on saturday night except stay in his room and squeeze his pimples or something mal said he didnt mind but that he wasnt too crazy about the idea he didnt like ackley much anyway we both went to our rooms to get ready and all and while i was putting on my galoshes and crap i yelled over and asked old ackley if he wanted to go to the movies he could hear me all right through the shower curtains but he didnt answer me right away he was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you right away finally he came over through the goddam curtains and stood on the shower ledge and asked who was going besides me he always had to know who was going i swear if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere and you rescued him in a goddam boat hed want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before hed even get in i told him mal brossard was going he said that bastard all right wait a second youd think he was doing you a big favor it took him about five hours to get ready while he was doing it i went over to my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands the snow was very good for packing i didnt throw it at anything though i started to throw it at a car that was parked across the street but i changed my mind the car looked so nice and white then i started to throw it at a hydrant but that looked too nice and white too finally i didnt throw it at anything all i did was close the window and walk around the room with the snowball packing it harder a little while later i still had it with me when i and brossnad and ackley got on the bus the bus driver opened the doors and made me throw it out i told him i wasnt going to chuck it at anybody but he wouldnt believe me people never believe you brossard and ackley both had seen the pi cture that was playing so all we did we just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while then took the bus back to pencey i didnt care about not seeing the movie anyway it was supposed to be a comedy with cary grant in it and all that crap besides id been to the movies with brossard and ackley before they both laughed like hyenas at stuff that wasnt even funny i didnt even enjoy sitting next to them in the movies it was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm old brossard was a bridge fiend and he started looki ng around the dorm for a game old ackley parked himself in my room just for a change only instead of sitting on the arm of stradlaters chair he laid down on my bed with his face right on my pillow and all he started talking in this very monotonous voice and picking at all his pimples i dropped about a thousand hints but i couldnt get rid of him all he did was keep talking in this very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse with the summer before hed already told me about it about a hundred times every time he told it it was different one minute hed be giving it to her in his cousins buick the next minute hed be giving it to her under some boardwalk it was all a lot of crap naturally he was a virgin if ever i saw one i doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel anyway finally i had to come right out and tell him that i had to write a composition for stradlater and that he had to clear the hell out so i could concentrate he finally did but he took his time about it as usual after he left i put on my pajamas and bathrobe and my old hunting hat and started writing the composition the thing was i couldnt think of a room or a house or anything to describe the way stradlater said he had to have im not too crazy about describing rooms and houses anyway so what i did i wrote about my brother allies baseball mitt it was a very descriptive subject it really was my brother allie had this lefthanded fielders mitt he was lefthanded the thing that was descriptive about it though was that he had poems written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere in green ink he wrote them on it so that hed have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at bat hes dead now he got leukemia and died when we were up in maine on july youd have liked him he was two years younger than i was but he was about fifty times as intelligent he was terrifically intelligent his teachers were always writing letters to my mother telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like allie in their class and they werent just shooting the crap they really meant it but it wasnt just that he was the most intelligent member in the family he was also the nicest in lots of ways he never got mad at anybody people with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily but allie never did and he had very red hair ill tell you what kind of red hair he had i started playing golf when i was only ten years old i remember once the summer i was around twelve teeing off and all and having a hunch that if i turned around all of a sudden id see allie so i did and sure enough he was sitting on his bike outside the fencethere was this fence that went all around the courseand he was sitting there about a hundred and fifty yards behind me watching me tee off thats the kind of red hair he had god he was a nice kid though he used to laugh so hard at something he thought of at the dinner table that he just a bout fell off his chair i was only thirteen and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all because i broke all the windows in the garage i dont blame them i really dont i slept in the garage the night he died and i broke all the goddam windows with my fist just for the hell of it i even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer but my hand was already broken and everything by that time and i couldnt do it it was a very stupid thing to do ill admit but i hardly didnt even know i was doing it and you didnt know allie my hand still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all and i cant make a real fist any morenot a tight one i meanbut outside of that i dont care much i mean im not going to be a goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway anyway thats what i wrote stradlaters composition about old allies baseball mitt i happened to have it with me in my suitcase so i got it out and copied down the poems that were written on it all i had to do was change allies name so that nobody would know it was my brother and not stradlaters i wasnt too crazy about doing it but i couldnt think of anything else descriptive besides i sort of liked writing about it it took me about an hour because i had to use stradlaters lousy typewriter and it kept jamming on me the reason i didnt use my own was because id lent it to a guy down the hall it was around tenthirty i guess when i finished it i wasnt tired though so i looked out the window for a while it wasnt snowing out any more but every once in a while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started you could also hear old ackley snoring right through the goddam s hower curtains you could hear him he had sinus trouble and he couldnt breathe too hot when he was asleep that guy had just about everything sinus trouble pimples lousy teeth halitosis crumby fingernails you had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch some things are hard to remember im thinking now of when stradlater got back from his date with jane i mean i cant remember exactly what i was doing when i heard his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor i probably was still looking out the window but i swear i cant remember i was so damn worried thats why when i really worry about something i dont just fool around i even have to go to the bathroom when i worry about something only i dont go im too worried to go i dont want to interrupt my worrying to go if you knew stradlater youd have been worried too id doubledated with that bastard a couple of times and i know what im talking about he was unscrupulous he really was anyway the corridor was all linoleum and all and you could hear his goddam footsteps coming right towards the room i dont even remember where i was sitting when he came inat the window or in my chair or his i swear i cant remember he came in griping about how cold it was out then he said where the hell is everybody its like a goddam morgue around here i didnt even bother to answer him if he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was saturday night and everybody was out or asleep or home for the week end i wasnt going to break my neck telling him he started getting undressed he didnt say one goddam word about jane not one neither did i i just watched him all he did was thank me for letting him wear my houndstooth he hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet then when he was taking off his tie he asked me if id written his goddam composition for him i told him it was over on his goddam bed he walked over and read it while he was unbuttoning his shirt he stood there reading it and sort of stroking his bare chest and stomach with this very stupid expression on his face he was always stroking his stomach or his chest he was mad about himself all of a sudden he said for chrissake holden this is about a goddam baseball glove so what i said cold as hell wuddaya mean so what i told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house or something you said it had to be descriptive what the hells the difference if its about a baseball glove god damn it he was sore as hell he was really furious you always do everything backasswards he looked at me no wonder youre flunking the hell out of here he said you dont do one damn thing the way youre supposed to i mean it not one damn thing all right give it back to me then i said i went over and pulled it right out of his goddam hand then i tore it up what the hellja do that for he said i didnt even answer him i just threw the pieces in the wastebasket then i lay down on my bed and we both didnt say anything for a long time he got all undressed down to his shorts and i lay on my bed and lit a cigarette you werent allowed to smoke in the dorm but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and nobody could smell the smoke besides i did it to annoy stradlater it drove him crazy when you broke any rules he never smoked in the dorm it was only me he still didnt say one single solitary word about jane so finally i said youre back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for ninethirty did you make her be late signing in he was sitting on the edge of his bed cutting his goddam toenails when i asked him that coupla minutes he said who the hell signs out for ninethirty on a saturday night god how i hated him did you go to new york i said ya crazy how the hell could we go to new york if she only signed out for ninethirty thats tough he looked up at me listen he said if youre gonna smoke in the room how bout going down to the can and do it you may be getting the hell out of here but i have to stick around long enough to graduate i ignored him i really did i went right on smoking like a madman all i did was sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenails what a school you were always watching somebody cut their damn toenails or squeeze their pimples or something did you give her my regards i asked him yeah the hell he did the bastard whatd she say i said did you ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row no i didnt ask her what the hell ya think we did all nightplay checkers for chrissake i didnt even answer him god how i hated him if you didnt go to new york whered ya go with her i asked him after a little while i could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place boy was i getting nervous i just had a feeling something had gone funny he was finished cutting his damn toenails so he got up from the bed in just his damn shorts and all and started getting very damn playful he came over to my bed and started leaning over me and taking these playful as hell socks at my shoulder cut it out i said whered you go with her if you didnt go to new york nowhere we just sat in the goddam car he gave me another one of those playtul stupid little socks on the shoulder cut it out i said whose car ed bankys ed banky was the basketball coach at pencey old stradlater was one of his pets because he was the center on the team and ed banky always let him borrow his car when he wanted it it wasnt allowed for students to borrow faculty guys cars but all the athletic bastards stuck together in every school ive gone to all the athletic bastards stick together stradlater kept taking these shadow punches down at my shoulder he had his toothbrush in his hand and he put it in his mouth whatd you do i said give her the time in ed bankys goddam car my voice was shaking something awful what a thing to say want me to wash your mouth out with soap did you thats a professional secret buddy this next part i dont remember so hot all i know is i got up from the bed like i was going down to the can or something and then i tried to sock him with all my might right smack in the toothbrush so it would split his goddam throat open only i missed i didnt connect all i did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something it probably hurt him a little bit but not as much as i wanted it probably wouldve hurt him a lot but i did it with my right hand and i cant make a good fist with that hand on account of that injury i told you about anyway the next thing i knew i was on the goddam floor and he was sitting on my chest with his face all red that is he had his goddam knees on my chest and he weighed about a ton he had hold of

ten hours i can hardly even remember what all i said to him i told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like i told him he didnt even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back

goddam floor again i dont remember if he knocked me out or not but i dont think so its pretty hard to knock a guy out except in the goddam movies but my nose was bleeding all over the place when i looked up old stradlater was standing practically right on top of me he had his goddam toilet kit under his arm why the hell dontcha shut up when i tellya to he said he sounded pretty nervous he probably was scared hed fractured my skull or something when i hit the floor its too bad i didnt you asked for it god damn it he said boy did he look worried i didnt even bother to get up i just lay there in the floor for a while and kept calling him a moron sonuvabitch i was so mad i was practically bawling listen go wash your face stradlater said ya hear me i told him to go wash his own moron facewhich was a pretty childish thing to say but i was mad as hell i told him to stop off on the way to the can and give mrs schmidt the time mrs schmidt was the janitors wife she was around sixtyfive i kept sitting there on the floor till i heard old stradlater close the door and go down the corridor to the can then i got up i couldnt find my goddam hunting hat anywhere finally i found it it was under the bed i put it on and turned the old peak around to the back the way i liked it and then i went over and took a look at my stupid face in the mirror you never saw such gore in your life i had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bath robe it partly scared me and it partly fascinated me all that blood and all sort of made me look tough id only been in about two fights in my life and i lost both of them im not too tough im a pacifist if you want to know the truth i had a feeling old ackleyd probably heard all the racket and was awake so i went through the shower curtains into his room just to see what the hell he was doing i hardly ever went over to his room it always had a funny stink in it because he was so crumby in his personal habits a tiny bit of light came through the shower curtains and all from our room and i could see him lying in bed i knew damn well he was wide awake ackley i said yawake yeah it was pretty dark and i stepped on somebodys shoe on the floor and danm near fell on my head ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm he had a lot of white stuff on his face for his pimples he looked sort of spooky in the dark what the hellya doing anyway i said wuddaya mean what the hell am i doing i was tryna sleep before you guys started making all that noise what the hell was the fight about anyhow wheres the light i couldnt find the light i was sliding my hand all over the wall wuddaya want the light for right next to your hand i finally found the switch and turned it on old ackley put his hand up so the light wouldnt hurt his eyes jesus he said what the hell happened to you he meant all the blood and all i had a little goddam tiff with stradlater i said then i sat down on the floor they never had any chairs in their room i dont know what the hell they did with their chairs listen i said do you feel like playing a little canasta he was a canasta fiend youre still bleeding for chrissake you better put something on it itll stop listen ya wanna play a little canasta or dontcha canasta for chrissake do you know what time it is by any chance it isnt late its only around eleven eleventhirty only around ackley said listen i gotta get up and go to mass in the morning for chrissake you guys start hollering and fighting in the middle of the goddamwhat the hell was the fight about anyhow its a long story i dont wanna bore ya ackley im thinking of your welfare i told him i never discussed my personal life with him in the first place he was even more stupid than stradlater stradlater wa s a goddam genius next to ackley hey i said is it okay if i sleep in elys bed tonight he wont be back till tomorrow night will he i knew damn well he wouldnt ely went home damn near every week end i dont know when the hell hes coming back ackley said boy did that annoy me what the hell do you mean you dont know when hes coming back he never comes back till sunday night does he no but for chrissake i cant just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam bed if they want to that killed me i reached up from where i was sitting on the floor and patted him on the goddam shoulder youre a prince ackley kid i said you know that no i mean iti cant just tell somebody they can sleep in youre a real prince youre a gentleman and a scholar kid i said he really was too do you happen to have any cigarettes by any chancesay no or ill drop dead no i dont as a matter of fact listen what the hell was the fight about i didnt answer him all i did was i got up and went over and looked out the window i felt so lonesome all of a sudden i almost wished i was dead what the hell was the fight about anyhow ackley said for about the fiftieth time he certainly was a bore about that about you i said about me for chrissake yeah i was defending your goddam honor stradlater said you had a lousy personality i couldnt let him get away with that stuff that got him excited he did no kidding he did i told him i was only kidding and then i went over and laid down on elys bed boy did i feel rotten i felt so damn lonesome this room stinks i said i can smell your socks from way over here dontcha ever send them to the laundry if you dont like it you know what you can do ackley said what a witty guy how bout turning off the goddam light i didnt turn it off right away though i just kept laying there on elys bed thinking about jane and all it just drove me stark staring mad when i thought about her and stradlater parked somewhere in that fatassed ed bankys car every time i thought about it i felt like jumping out the window the thing is you didnt know stradlater i knew him most guys at pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all the timelike ackley for instancebut old stradlater really did it i was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to thats the truth tell me the story of your fascinating life ackley kid i said how bout turning off the goddam light i gotta get up for mass in the morning i got up and turned it off if it made him happy then i laid down on elys bed again whatre ya gonna dosleep in elys bed ackley said he was the perfect host boy i may i may not dont worry about it im not worried about it only id hate like hell if ely came in all of a sudden and found some guy relax im not gonna sleep here i wouldnt abuse your goddam hospitality a couple of minutes later he was snoring like mad i kept laying there in the dark anyway though trying not to think about old jane and stradlater in that goddam ed bankys car but it was almost impossible the trouble was i knew that guy stradlaters technique that made it even worse we once doubledated in ed bankys car and stradlater was in the back with his date and i was in the front with mine what a technique that guy had what hed do was hed start snowing his date in this very quiet sincere voicelike as if he wasnt only a very handsome guy but a nice sincere guy too i damn near puked listening to him his date kept saying noplease please dont please but old stradlater kept snowing her in this abraham lincoln sincere voice and finally thered be this terrific silence in the back of the car it was really embarrassing i dont think he gave that girl the time that nightbut damn near damn near while i was laying there trying not to think i heard old stradlater come back from the can and go in our room you could hear him putting away his crumby toilet articles and all and opening the window he was a freshair fiend then a little while later he turned off the light he didnt even look around to see where i was at it was even depressing out in the street you couldnt even hear any cars any more i got feeling so lonesome and rotten i even felt like waking ackley up hey ackley i said in sort of a whisper so stradlater couldnt hear me through the shower curtain ackley didnt hear me though hey ackley he still didnt hear me he slept like a rock hey ackley he heard that all right what the hells the matter with you he said i was asleep for chrissake listen whats the routine on joining a monastery i asked him i was sort of toying with the idea of joining one do you have to be a catholic and all certainly you have to be a catholic you bastard did you wake me just to ask me a dumb ques aah go back to sleep im not gonna join one anyway the kind of luck i have id probably join one with all the wrong kind of monks in it all stupid bastards or just bastards when i said that old ackley sat way the hell up in bed listen he said i dont care what you say about me or anything but if you start making cracks about my goddam religion for chrissake relax i said nobodys making any cracks about your goddam religion i got up off elys bed and started towards the door i didnt want to hang around in that stupid atmosphere any more i stopped on the way though and picked up ackleys hand and gave him a big phony handshake he pulled it away from me whats the idea he said no idea i just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince thats all i said i said it in this very sincere voice youre aces ackley kid i said you know that wise guy someday somebodys gonna bash your i didnt even bother to listen to him i shut the damn door and went out in the corridor everybody was asleep or out or home for the week end and it was very very quiet and depressing in the corridor there was this empty box of kolynos toothpaste outside leahy and hoffmans door and while i walked down towards the stairs i kept giving it a boot with this sheeplined slipper i had on what i thought id do i thought i might go down and see what old mal brossard was doing but all of a sudden i changed my mind all of a sudden i decided what id really do id get the hell out of penceyright that same night and all i mean not wait till wednesday or anything i just didnt want to hang around any more it made me too sad and lonesome so what i decided to do i decided id take a room in a hotel in new yorksome very inexpensive hotel and alland just take it easy till wednesday then on wednesday id go home all rested up and feeling swell i figured my parents probably wouldnt get old thurmers letter saying id been given the ax till maybe tuesday or wednesday i didnt want to go home or anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all i didnt want to be around when they first got it my mother gets very hysterical shes not too bad after she gets something thoroughly digested though besides i sort of needed a little vacation my nerves were shot they really were anyway thats what i decided id do so i went back to the room and turned on the light to start packing and all i already had quite a few things packed old stradlater didnt even wake up i lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then i packed these two gladstones i have it only took me about two minutes im a very rapid packer one thing about packing depressed me a little i had to pack these brandnew ice skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before that depressed me i could see my mother going in spauldings and asking the salesman a million dopy questionsand here i was getting the ax again it made me feel pretty sad she bought me the wrong kind of skatesi wanted racing skates and she bought hockeybut it made me sad anyway almost every time somebody gives me a present it ends up making me sad after i got all packed i sort of counted my dough i dont remember exactly how much i had but i was pretty loaded my grandmotherd just sent me a wad about a week before i have this grandmother thats quite lavish with her dough she doesnt have all her marbles any moreshes old as helland she keeps sending me money for my birthday about four times a year anyway even though i was pretty loaded i figured i could always use a few extra bucks you never know so what i did was i went down the hail and woke up frederick woodruff this guy id lent my typewriter to i asked him how much hed give me for it he was a pretty wealthy guy he said he didnt know he said he didnt much want to buy it finally he bought it though it cost about ninety bucks and all he bought it for was twenty he was sore because id woke him up when i was all set to go when i had my bags and all i stood for a while next to the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor i was sort of crying i dont know why i put my red hunting hat on and turned the peak around to the back the way i liked it and then i yelled at the top of my goddam voice sleep tight ya morons ill bet i woke up every bastard on the whole floor then i got the hell out some stupid guy had thrown peanut shells all over the stairs and i damn near broke my crazy neck it was too late to call up for a cab or anything so i walked the whole way to the station it wasnt too far but it was cold as hell and the snow made it hard for walking and my gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs i sort of enjoyed the air and all though the only trouble was the cold made my nose hurt and right under my upper lip where old stradlaterd laid one on me hed smacked my lip right on my teeth and it was pretty sore my ears were nice and warm though that hat i bought had earlaps in it and i put them oni didnt give a damn how i looked nobody was around anyway everybody was in the sack i was quite lucky when i got to the station because i only had to wait about ten minutes for a train while i waited i got some snow in my hand and washed my face with it i still had quite a bit of blood on usually i like riding on trains especially at night with the lights on and the windows so black and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and sandwiches and magazines i usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines if im on a train at night i can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a magazine without puking you know one of those stories with a lot of phony leanjawed guys named david in it and a lot of phony girls named linda or marcia that are always lighting all the goddam davids pipes for them i can even read one of those lousy stories on a train at night usually but this time it was different i just didnt feel like it i just sort of sat and not did anything all i did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my pocket all of a sudden this lady got on at trenton and sat down next to me practically the whole car was empty because it was pretty late and all but she sat down next to me instead of an empty seat because she had this big bag with her and i was sitting in the front seat she stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle where the conductor and everybody could trip over it she had these orchids on like shed just been to a big party or something she was around forty or forty five i guess but she was very good looking women kill me they really do i dont mean im oversexed or anything like that although i am quite sexy i just like them i mean theyre always leaving their goddam bags out in the middle of the aisle anyway we were sitting there and all of a sudden she said to me excuse me but isnt that a pencey prep sticker she was looking up at my suitcases up on the rack yes it is i said she was right i did have a goddam pencey sticker on one of my gladstones very corny ill admit oh do you go to pencey she said she had a nice voice a nice telephone voice mostly she shouldve carried a goddam telephone around with her yes i do i said oh how lovely perhaps you know my son then ernest morrow he goes to pencey yes i do hes in my class her son was doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to pencey in the whole crumby history of the school he was always going down the corridor after hed had a shower snapping his soggy old wet towel at peoples asses thats exactly the kind of a guy he was oh how nice the lady said but not corny she was just nice and all i must tell ernest we met she said may i ask your name dear rudolf schmidt i told her i didnt feel like giving her my whole life history rudolf schmidt was the name of the janitor of our dorm do you like pencey she asked me pencey its not too bad its not paradise or anything but its as good as most schools some of the faculty are pretty conscientious ernest just adores it i know he does i said then i started shooting the old crap around a little bit he adapts himself very well to things he really does i mean he really knows how to adapt himself do you think so she asked me she sounded interested as hell ernest sure i said then i watched her take off her gloves boy was she lousy with rocks i just broke a nail getting out of a cab she said she looked up at me and sort of smiled she had a terrifically nice smile she really did most people have hardly any smile at all or a lousy one ernests father and i sometimes worry about him she said we sometimes feel hes not a terribly good mixer how do you mean well hes a very sensitive boy hes really never been a terribly good mixer with other boys perhaps he takes things a little more seriously than he should at his age sensitive that killed me that guy morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam toilet seat i gave her a good look she didnt look like any dope to me she looked like she might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of but you cant always tellwith somebodys mother i mean mothers are all slightly insane the thing is though i liked old morrows mother she was all right would you care for a cigarette i asked her she looked all around i dont believe this is a smoker rudolf she said rudolf that killed me thats all right we can smoke till they start screaming at us i said she took a cigarette off me and i gave her a light she looked nice smoking she inhaled and all but she didnt wolf the smoke down the way most women around her age do she had a lot of charm she had quite a lot of sex appeal too if you really want to know she was looking at me sort of funny i may be wrong but i believe your nose is bleeding dear she said all of a sudden i nodded and took out my handkerchief i got hit with a snowball i said one of those very icy ones i probably wouldve told her what really happened but it wouldve taken too long i liked her though i was beginning to feel sort of sorry id told her my name was rudolf schmidt old ernie i said hes one of the most popular boys at pencey did you know that no i didnt i nodded it really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him hes a funny guy a strange guy in lots of waysknow what i mean like when i first met him when i first met him i thought he was kind of a snobbish person thats what i thought but he isnt hes just got this very original personality that takes you a little while to get to know him old mrs morrow didnt say anything but boy you shouldve seen her i had her glued to her seat you take somebodys mother all they want to hear about is what a hot shot their son is then i really started chucking the old crap around did he tell you about the elections i asked her the class elections she shook her head i had her in a trance like i really did well a bunch of us wanted old ernie to be president of the class i mean he was the unanimous choice i mean he was the only boy that could really handle the job i saidboy was i chucking it but this other boyharry fencerwas elected and the reason he was elected the simple and obvious reason was because ernie wouldnt let us nominate him because hes so darn shy and modest and all he refused boy hes really shy you oughta make him try to get over that i looked at her didnt he tell you about it no he didnt i nodded thats ernie he wouldnt thats the one fault with himhes too shy and modest you really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally right that minute the conductor came around for old mrs morrows ticket and it gave me a chance to quit shooting it im glad i shot it for a while though you take a guy like morrow thats always snapping their towel at peoples assesreally trying to hurt somebody with itthey dont just stay a rat while theyre a kid they stay a rat their whole life but ill bet after all the crap i shot mr s morrowll keep thinking of him now as this very shy modest guy that wouldnt let us nominate him for president she might you cant tell mothers arent too sharp about that stuff would you care for a cocktail i asked her i was feeling in the mood for one myself we can go in the club car all right dear are you allowed to order drinks she asked me not snotty though she was too charming and all to be snotty well no not exactly but i can usually get them on account of my heighth i said and i have quite a bit of gray hair i turned sideways and showed her my gray hair it fascinated hell out of her cmon join me why dont you i said idve enjoyed having her i really dont think id better thank you so much though dear she said anyway the club cars most likely closed its quite late you know she was right id forgotten all about what time it was then she looked at me and asked me what i was afraid she was going to ask me ernest wrote that hed be home on wednesday that christmas vacation would start on wednesday she said i hope you werent called home suddenly because of illness in the family she really looked worried about it she wasnt just being nosy you could tell no everybodys fine at home i said its me i have to have this operation oh im so sorry she said she really was too i was right away sorry id said it but it was too late it isnt very serious i have this tiny little tumor on the brain oh no she put her hand up to her mouth and all oh ill be all right and everything its right near the outside and its a very tiny one they can take it out in about two minutes then i started reading this timetable i had in my pocket just to stop lying once i get started i can go on for hours if i feel like it no kidding hours we didnt talk too much after that she started reading this vogue she had with her and i looked out the window for a while she got off at newark she wished me a lot of luck with the operation and all she kept calling me rudolf then she invited me to visit ernie during the summer at gloucester massachusetts she said their house was right on the beach and they had a tennis court a nd all but i just thanked her and told her i was going to south america with my grandmother which was really a hot one because my grandmother hardly ever even goes out of the house except maybe to go to a goddam matinee or something but i wouldnt visit that sonuvabitch morrow for all the dough in the world even if i was desperate the first thing i did when i got off at penn station i went into this phone booth i felt like giving somebody a buzz i left my bags right outside the booth so that i could watch them but as soon as i was inside i couldnt think of anybody to call up my brother db was in hollywood my kid sister phoebe goes to bed around nine oclock so i couldnt call her up she wouldntve cared if id woke her up but the trouble was she wouldntve been the one that answered the phone my parents would be the ones so that was out then i thought of giving jane gallaghers mother a buzz and find out when janes vacation started but i didnt feel like it besides it was pretty late to call up then i thought of calling this girl i used to go around with quite frequently sally hayes because i knew her christmas vacation had started alreadyshed written me this long phony letter inviting me over to help her trim the christmas tree christmas eve and allbut i was afraid her motherd answer the phone her mother knew my mother and i could picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother i was in new york besides i wasnt crazy about talking to old mrs hayes on the phone she once told sally i was wild she said i was wild and that i had no direction in life then i thought of calling up this guy that went to the whooton school when i was there carl luce but i didnt like him much so i ended up not calling anybody i came out of the booth after about twenty minutes or so and got my bags and walked over to that tunnel where the cabs are and got a cab im so damn absentminded i gave the driver my regular address just out of habit and alli mean i completely forgot i was going to shack up in a hotel for a couple of days and not go home till vacation started i didnt think of it till we were halfway through the park then i said hey do you mind turning around when you get a chance i gave you the wrong address i want to go back downtown the driver was sort of a wise guy i cant turn around here mac this heres a oneway ill have to go all the way to ninedieth street now i didnt want to start an argument okay i said then i thought of something all of a sudden hey listen i said you know those ducks in that lagoon right near central park south that little lake by any chance do you happen to know where they go the ducks when it gets all frozen over do you happen to know by any chance i realized it was only one chance in a million he turned around and looked at me like i was a madman whatre ya tryna do bud he said kid me noi was just interested thats all he didnt say anything more so i didnt either until we came out of the park at ninetieth street then he said all right buddy where to well the thing is i dont want to stay at any hotels on the east side where i might run into some acquaintances of mine im traveling incognito i said i hate saying corny things like traveling incognito but when im with somebody thats corny i always act corny too do you happen to know whose bands at the taft or the new yorker by any chance no idear mac welltake me to the edmont then i said would you care to stop on the way and join me for a cocktail on me im loaded cant do it mac sorry he certainly was good company terrific personality we got to the edmont hotel and i checked in id put on my red hunting cap when i was in the cab just for the hell of it but i took it off before i checked in i didnt want to look like a screwball or something which is really ironic i didnt know then that the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons screwballs all over the place they gave me this very crumby room with nothing to look out of the window at except the other side of the hotel i didnt care much i was too depressed to care whether i had a good view or not the bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy around sixtyfive he was even more depressing than the room was he was one of those bald guys that comb all their hair over from th e side to cover up the baldness id rather be bald than do that anyway what a gorgeous job for a guy around sixtyfive years old carrying peoples suitcases and waiting around for a tip i suppose he wasnt too intelligent or anything but it was terrible anyway after he left i looked out the window for a while with my coat on and all i didnt have anything else to do youd be surprised what was going on on the other side of the hotel they didnt even bother to pull their shades down i saw one guy a grayhaired very distinguishedlooking guy with only his shorts on do something you wouldnt believe me if i told you first he put his suitcase on the bed then he took out all these womens clothes and put them on real wo mens clothessilk stockings highheeled shoes brassiere and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all then he put on this very tight black evening dress i swear to god then he started walking up and down the room taking these very small steps the way a woman does and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror he was all alone too unless somebody was in the bathroomi couldnt see that much then in the window almost right over his i saw a man and a woman squirting water out of their mouths at each other it probably was highballs not water but i couldnt see what they had in their glasses anyway first hed take a swallow and squirt it all over her then she did it to himthey took turns for gods sake you shouldve seen them they were in hysterics the whole time like it was the funniest thing that ever happened im not kidding the hotel was lousy with perverts i was probably the only normal bastard in the whole placeand that isnt saying much i damn near sent a telegram to old stradlater telling him to take the first train to new york hed have been the king of the hotel the trouble was that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch even if you dont want it to be for instance that girl that was getting water squirted all over her face she was pretty goodlooking i mean thats my big trouble in my mind im probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw sometimes i can think of very crumby stuff i wouldnt mind doing if the opportunity came up i can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun in a crumby way and if you were both sort of drunk and all to get a girl and squirt water or something all over each others face the thing is though i dont like the idea it stinks if you analyze it i think if you dont really like a girl you shouldnt horse around with her at all and if you do like her then youre supposed to like her face and if you like her face you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it like squirting water all over it its really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes girls arent too much help either when you start trying not to get too crumby when you start trying not to spoil anything really good i knew this one girl a couple of years ago that was even crumbier than i was boy was she crumby we had a lot of fun though for a while in a crumby way sex is something i really dont understand too hot you never know where the hell you are i keep making up these sex rules for myself and then i break them right away last year i made a rule that i was going to quit horsing around with girls that deep down gave me a pain in the ass i broke it though the same week i made itthe same night as a matter of fact i spent the whole night necking with a terrible phony named anne louise sherman sex is something i just dont understand i swear to god i dont i started toying with the idea while i kept standing there of giving old jane a buzzi mean calling her long distance at bm where she went instead of calling up her mother to find out when she was coming home you werent supposed to call students up late at night but i had it all figured out i was going to tell whoever answered the phone that i was her uncle i was going to say her aunt had just got killed in a car accident and i had to speak to her immediately it wouldve worked too the only reason i didnt do it was because i wasnt in the mood if youre not in the mood you cant do that stuff right after a while i sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarettes i was feeling pretty horny i have to admit it then all of a sudden i got this idea i took out my wallet and started looking for this address a guy i met at a party last summer that went to princeton gave me finally i found it it was all a funny color from my wallet but you could still read it it was the address of this girl that wasnt exactly a whore or anything but that didnt mind doing it once in a while this princeton guy told me he brought her to a dance at princeton once and they nearly kicked him out for bringing her she used to be a burlesque stripper or something anyway i went over to the phone and gave her a buzz her name was faith cavendish and she lived at the stanford arms hotel on sixtyfifth and broadway a dump no doubt for a while i didn t think she was home or something nobody kept answering then finally somebody picked up the phone hello i said i made my voice quite deep so that she wouldnt suspect my age or anything i have a pretty deep voice anyway hello this womans voice said none too friendly either is this miss faith cavendish whos this she said whos calling me up at this crazy goddam hour that sort of scared me a little bit well i know its quite late i said in this very mature voice and all i hope youll forgive me but i was very anxious to get in touch with you i said it suave as hell i really did who is this she said well you dont know me but im a friend of eddie birdsells he suggested that if i were in town sometime we ought to get together for a cocktail or two who youre a friend of who boy she was a real tigress over the phone she was damn near yelling at me edmund birdsell eddie birdsell i said i couldnt remember if his name was edmund or edward i only met him once at a goddam stupid party i dont know anybody by that name jack and if you think i enjoy bein woke up in the middle eddie birdsell from princeton i said you could tell she was running the name over in her mind and all birdsell birdsell from princeton princeton college thats right i said you from princeton college well approximately oh how is eddie she said this is certainly a peculiar time to call a person up though jesus christ hes fine he asked to be remembered to you well thank you remember me to him she said hes a grand person whats he doing now she was getting friendly as hell all of a sudden oh you know same old stuff i said how the hell did i know what he was doing i hardly knew the guy i didnt even know if he was still at princeton look i said would you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere by any chance do you have any idea what time it is she said whats your name anyhow may i ask she was getting an english accent all of a sudden you sound a little on the young side i laughed thank you for the compliment i said suave as hell holden caulfields my name i shouldve given her a phony name but i didnt think of it well look mr cawffle im not in the habit of making engagements in the middle

hope you enjoy your stay in new york its a grand place i know it is thanks good night i said then i hung up boy i really fouled that up i shouldve at least made it for cocktails or something it was still pretty early im not sure what time it was but it wasnt too late the one thing i hate to do is go to bed when im not even tired so i opened my suitcases and took out a clean shirt and then i went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt what i thought id do i thought id go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in the lavender room they had this night club the lavender room in the hotel while i was changing my shirt i damn near gave my kid sister phoebe a buzz though i certainly felt like talking to her on the phone somebody with sense and all but i couldnt take a chance on giving her a buzz because she was only a little kid and she wouldnt have been up let alone anywhere near the phone i thought of maybe hanging up if my parents answered but that wouldntve worked either theyd know it was me my mother always knows its me shes psychic but i certainly wouldnt have minded shooting the crap with old phoebe for a while you should see her you never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole life shes really smart i mean shes had all as ever since she started school as a matter of fact im the only dumb one in the family my brother dbs a writer and all and my brother allie the one that died that i told you about was a wizard im the only really dumb one but you ought to see old phoebe she has this sort of red hair a little bit like allies was thats very short in the summertime in the summertime she sticks it behind her ears she has nice pretty little ears in the wintertime its pretty long though sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesnt its really nice though shes only ten shes quite skinny like me but nice skinny rollerskate skinny i watched her once from the window when she was crossing over fifth avenue to go to the park and thats what she is rollerskate skinny youd like her i mean if you tell old phoebe something she knows exactly what the hell youre talking about i mean you can even take her anywhere with you if you take her to a lousy movie for instance she knows its a lousy movie if you take her to a pretty good movie she knows its a pretty good movie db and i took her to see this french movie the bakers wife with raimu in it it killed her her favorite is the steps though with robert donat she knows the whole goddam movie by heart because ive taken her to see it about ten times when old donat comes up to this scotch farmhouse for instance when hes running away from the cops and all phoebell say right out loud in the movieright when the scotch guy in the picture says itcan you eat the herring she knows all the talk by heart and when this professor in the picture thats really a german spy sticks up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing to show robert donat old phoebe beats him to itshe holds up her little finger at me in the dark right in front of my face shes all right youd like her the only trouble is shes a little too affectionate sometimes shes very emotional for a child she really is something else she does she writes books all the time only she doesnt finish them theyre all about some kid named hazel weatherfieldonly old phoebe spells it hazle old hazle weatherfield is a girl detective shes supposed to be an orphan but her old man keeps showing up her old mans always a tall attractive gentleman about years of age that kills me old phoebe i swear to god youd like her she was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid when she was a very tiny little kid i and allie used to take her to the park with us especially on sundays allie had this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on sundays and we used to take old phoebe with us shed wear white gloves and walk right between us like a lady and all and when allie and i were having some conversation about things in general old phoebed be listening sometimes youd forget she was around because she was such a little kid but shed let you know shed interrupt you all the time shed give allie or i a push or something and say who who said that bobby or the lady and wed tell her who said it and shed say oh and go right on listening and all she killed allie too i mean he liked her too shes ten now and not such a tiny little kid any more but she still kills everybodyeverybody with any sense anyway anyway she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone but i was too afraid my parents would answer and then theyd find out i was in new york and kicked out of pencey and all so i just finished putting on my shirt then i got all ready and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on except for a few pimpylooking guys and a few whorylooking blondes the lobby was pretty empty but you could hear the band playing in the lavender room and so i went in there it wasnt very crowded but they gave me a lousy table anywayway in the back i shouldve waved a buck under the headwaiters nose in new york boy money really talksim not kidding the band was putrid buddy singer very brassy but not good brassycorny brassy also there were very few people around my age in the place in fact nobody was around my age they were mostly old showo ffylooking guys with their dates except at the table right next to me at the table right next to me there were these three girls around thirty or so the whole three of them were pretty ugly and they all had on the kind of hats that you knew they didnt really live in new york but one of them the blonde one wasnt too bad she was sort of cute the blonde one and i started giving her the old eye a little bit but just then the waiter came up for my order i ordered a scotch and soda and told him not to mix iti said it fast as hell because if you hem and haw they think youre under twentyone and wont sell you any intoxicating liquor i had trouble with him anyway though im sorry sir he said but do you have some verification of your age your drivers license perhaps i gave him this very cold stare like hed insulted the hell out of me and asked him do i look like im under twentyone im sorry sir but we have our okay okay i said i figured the hell with it bring me a coke he started to go away but i called him back cantcha stick a little rum in it or something i asked him i asked him very nicely and all i cant sit in a corny place like this cold sober cantcha stick a little rum in it or something im very sorry sir he said and beat it on me i didnt hold it against him though they lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor im a goddam minor i started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again that is the blonde one the other two were strictly from hunger i didnt do it crudely though i just gave all three of them this very cool glance and all what they did though the three of them when i did it they started giggling like morons they probably thought i was too young to give anybody the onceover that annoyed hell out of me youdve thought i wanted to marry them or something i shouldve given them the freeze after they did that but the trouble was i really felt like dancing im very fond of dancing sometimes and that was one of the times so all of a sudden i sort of leaned over and said would any of you girls care to dance i didnt ask them cr udely or anything very suave in fact but god damn it they thought that was a panic too they started giggling some more im not kidding they were three real morons cmon i said ill dance with you one at a time all right how bout it cmon i really felt like dancing finally the blonde one got up to dance with me because you could tell i was really talking to her and we walked out to the dance floor the other two grools nearly had hysterics when we did i certainly mustve been very hard up to even bother with any of them but it was worth it the blonde was some dancer she was one of the best dancers i ever danced with im not kidding some of these very stupid girls can really knock you out on a dance floor you take a really smart girl and half the time shes trying to lead you around the dance floor or else shes such a lousy dancer the best thing to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her you really can dance i told the blonde one you oughta be a pro i mean it i danced with a pro once and youre twice as good as she was did you ever hear of marco and miranda what she said she wasnt even listening to me she was looking all around the place i said did you ever hear of marco and miranda i dont know no i dont know well theyre dancers shes a dancer shes not too hot though she does everything shes supposed to but shes not so hot anyway you know when a girls really a terrific dancer wudga say she said she wasnt listening to me even her mind was wandering all over the place i said do you know when a girls really a terrific dancer uhuh wellwhere i have my hand on your back if i think there isnt anything underneath my handno can no legs no feet no anythingthen the girls really a terrific dancer she wasnt listening though so i ignored her for a while we just danced god could that dopey girl dance buddy singer and his stinking band was playing just one of those things and even they couldnt ruin it entirely its a swell song i didnt try any trick stuff while we dancedi hate a guy that does a lot of showoff tricky stuff on the dance floorbut i was moving her around plenty and she stayed with me the funny thing is i thought she was enjoying it too till all of a sudden she came out with this very dumb remark i and my girl friends saw pete r lorre last night she said the movie actor in person he was buyin a newspaper hes cute youre lucky i told her youre really lucky you know that she was really a moron but what a dancer i could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the top of her dopey headyou know right where the part is and all she got sore when i did it hey whats the idea nothing no idea you really can dance i said i have a kid sister thats only in the goddam fourth grade youre about as good as she is and she can dance better than anybody living or dead watch your language if you dont mind what a lady boy a queen for chrissake where you girls from i asked her she didnt answer me though she was busy looking around for old peter lorre to show up i guess where you girls from i asked her again what she said where you girls from dont answer if you dont feel like it i dont want you to strain yourself seattle washington she said she was doing me a big favor to tell me youre a very good conversationalist i told her you know that what i let it drop it was over her head anyway do you feel like jitterbugging a little bit if they play a fast one not corny jitterbug not jump or anythingjust nice and easy everybodyll all sit down when they play a fast one except the old guys and the fat guys and well have plenty of room okay its immaterial to me she said heyhow old are you anyhow that annoyed me for some reason oh christ dont spoil it i said im twelve for chrissake im big for my age listen i toleja about that i dont like that type language she said if youre gonna use that type language i can go sit down with my girl friends you know i apologized like a madman because the band was starting a fast one she started jitterbugging with me but just very nice and easy not corny she was really good all you had to do was touch her and when she turned around her pretty little butt twitched so nice and all she knocked me out i mean it i was half in love with her by the time we sat down thats the thing about girls every time they do something pretty even if theyre not much to look at or even if they re sort of stupid you fall half in love with them and then you never know where the hell you are girls jesus christ they can drive you crazy they really can they didnt invite me to sit down at their table mostly because they were too ignorantbut i sat down anyway the blonde id been dancing withs name was bernice somethingcrabs or krebs the two ugly ones names were marty and laverne i told them my name was jim steele just for the hell of it then i tried to get them in a little intelligent conversation but it was practically impossible you had to twist their arms you could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them and the whole three of them kept looking all around the goddam room like as if they expected a flock of goddam movie stars to come in any minute they probably thought movie stars always hung out in the lavender room when they came to new york instead of the stork club or el morocco and all anyway it took me about a half hour to find out where they all worked and all in seattle they all worked in the same insurance office i asked them if they liked it but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three dopes i thought the two ugly ones marty and laverne were sisters but they got very insulted when i asked them you could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the other one and you couldnt blame them but it was very amusing anyway i danced with them allthe whole three of themone at a time the one ugly one laverne wasnt too bad a dancer but the other one old marty was murder old marty was like dragging the statue of liberty around the floor the only way i could even half enjoy myself dragging her around was if i amused myself a little so i told her i just saw gary cooper the movie star on the other side of the floor where she asked meexcited as hell where aw you just missed him he just went out why didnt you look when i told you she practically stopped dancing and started looking over everybodys heads to see if she could see him oh shoot she said id just about broken her heart i really had i was sorry as hell id kidded her some people you shouldnt kid even if they deserve it heres what was very funny though when we got back to the table old marty told the other two that gary cooper had just gone out boy old laverne and bernice nearly committed suicide when they heard that they got all excited and asked marty if shed seen him and all old mart said shed only caught a glimpse of him that killed me the bar was closing up for the night so i bought them all two drinks apiece quick before it closed and i ordered two more cokes for myself the goddam table was lousy with glasses the one ugly one laverne kept kidding me because i was only drinking cokes she had a sterling sense of humor she and old marty were drinking tom collinsesin the middle of december for gods sake they didnt know any better the blonde one old bernice was drinking bourbon and water she was really putting it away too the whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time they hardly talkedeven to each other old marty talked more than the other two she kept saying these very corny boring things like calling the can the little girls room and she thought buddy singers poor old beatup clarinet player was really terrific when he stood up and took a couple of icecold hot licks she called his clarinet a licorice stick was she corny the other ugly one laverne thought she was a very witty type she kept asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight she kept asking me if my father had a date or not four times she asked me thatshe was certainly witty old bernice the blonde one didnt say hardly anything at all every time id ask her something she said what that can get on your nerves after a while all of a sudden when they finished their drink all three of them stood up on me and said they had to get to bed they said they were going to get up early to see the first show at radio city music hall i tried to get them to stick around for a while but they wouldnt so we said goodby and all i told them id look them up in seattle sometime if i ever got there but i doubt if i ever will look them up i mean with cigarettes and all the check came to about thirteen bucks i think they shouldve at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before i joined themi wouldntve let them naturally but they shouldve at least offered i didnt care much though they were so ignorant and they had those sad fancy hats on and all and that business about getting up early to see the first show at radio city music hall depressed me if somebody some girl in an awfullooking hat for instance comes all the way to new yorkfrom seattle washington for gods sakeand ends up getting up early in the morning to see the goddam first show at radio city music hall it makes me so depressed i cant stand it idve bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only they hadnt told me that i left the lavender room pretty soon after they did they were closing it up anyway and the band had quit a long time ago in the first place it was one of those places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with or unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just cokes there isnt any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk or unless youre with some girl that really knocks you out all of a sudden on my way out to the lobby i got old jane gallagher on the brain again i got her on and i couldnt get her off i sat down in this vomitylooking chair in the lobby and thought about her and stradlater sitting in that goddam ed bankys car and though i was pretty damn sure old stradlater hadnt given her the timei know old jane like a booki still couldnt get her off my brain i knew her like a book i really did i mean besides checkers she was quite fond of all athletic sports and after i got to know her the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon i really got to know her quite intimately i dont mean it was anything physical or anythingit wasntbut we saw each other all the time you dont always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl the way i met her this doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve himself on our lawn and my mother got very irritated about it she called up janes mother and made a big stink about it my mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff then what happened a couple of days later i saw jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool at the club and i said hello to her i knew she lived in the house next to ours but id never conversed with her before or anything she gave me the big freeze when i said hello that day though i had a helluva time convincing her that i didnt give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself he could do it in the living room for all i cared anyway after that jane and i got to be friends and all i played golf with her that same afternoon she lost eight balls i remember eight i had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball i improved her game immensely though im a very good golfer if i told you what i go around in you probably wouldnt believe me i almost was once in a movie short but i changed my mind at the last minute i figured that anybody that hates the movies as much as i do id be a phony if i let them stick me in a movie short she was a funny girl old jane i wouldnt ex actly describe her as strictly beautiful she knocked me out though she was sort of mucklemouthed i mean when she was talking and she got excited about something her mouth sort of went in about fifty directions her lips and all that killed me and she never really closed it all the way her mouth it was always just a little bit open especially when she got in her golf stance or when she was reading a book she was always reading and she read very good books she read a lot of poetry and all she was the only one outside my family that i ever showed allies baseball mitt to with all the poems written on it shed never met allie or anything because that was her first summer in mainebefore that she went to cape cod but i told her quite a lot about him she was interested in that kind of stuff my mother didnt like her too much i mean my mother always thought jane and her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didnt say hello my mother saw them in the village a lot because jane used to drive to market with her mother in this lasalle convertible they had my mother didnt think jane was pretty even i did though i just liked the way she looked thats all i remember this one afternoon it was the only time old jane and i ever got close to necking even it was a saturday and it was raining like a bastard out and i was over at her house on the porchthey had this big screenedin porch we were playing checkers i used to kid her once in a while because she wouldnt take her kings out of the back row but i didnt kid her much though you never wanted to kid jane too much i think i really like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises but its a funny thing the girls i like best are the ones i never feel much like kidding sometimes i think theyd like it if you kidded themin fact i know they wouldbut its hard to get started once youve known them a pretty long time and never kidded them anyway i was telling you about that afternoon jane and i came close to necking it was raining like hell and we were out on her porch and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was married to came out on the porch and asked jane if there were any cigarettes in the house i didnt know him too well or anything but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldnt talk to you much unless he wanted something off you he had a lousy personality anyway old jane wouldnt answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was any cigarettes so the guy asked her again but she still wouldnt answer him she didnt even look up from the game finally the guy went inside the house when he did i asked jane what the hell was going on she wouldnt even answer me then she made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all then all of a sudden this tear plopped down on the checkerboard on one of the red squaresboy i can still see it she just rubbed it into the board with her finger i dont know why but it bothered hell out of me so what i did was i went over and made her move over on the glider so that i could sit down next to heri practically sat down in her lap as a matter of fact then she really started to cry and the next thing i knew i was kissing her all overanywhereher eyes her nose her forehead her eyebrows and all her earsher whole face except her mouth and all she sort of wouldnt let me get to her mouth anyway it was the closest we ever got to necking after a while she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had that knocked me out and we went to a goddam movie i asked her on the way if mr cudahythat was the booze hounds namehad ever tried to get wise with her she was pretty young but she had this terrific figure and i wouldntve put it past that cudahy bastard she said no though i never did find out what the hell was the matter some girls you practically never find out whats the matter i dont want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something just because we never necked or horsed around much she wasnt i held hands with her all the time for instance that doesnt sound like much i realize but she was terrific to hold hands with most girls if you hold hands with them their goddam hand dies on you or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time as if they were afraid theyd bore you or something jane was different wed get into a goddam movie or something and right away wed start holding hands and we wouldnt quit till the movie was over and without changing the position or making a big deal out of it you never even worried with jane whether your hand was sweaty or not all you knew was you were happy you really were one other thing i just thought of one time in this movie jane did something that just about knocked me out the newsreel was on or something and all of a sudden i felt this hand on the back of my neck and it was janes it was a funny thing to do i mean she was quite young and all and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back of somebodys neck theyre around twentyfive or thirty and usually theyre doing it to their husband or their little kidi do it to my kid sister phoebe once in a while for instance but if a girls quite young and all and she does it its so pretty it just about kills you anyway thats what i was thinking about while i sat in that vomitylooking chair in the lobby old jane every time i got to the part about her out with stradlater in that damn ed bankys car it almost drove me crazy i knew she wouldnt let him get to first base with her but it drove me crazy anyway i dont even like to talk about it if you want to know the truth there was hardly anybody in the lobby any more even all the whorylooking blondes werent around any more and all of a sudden i felt like getting the hell out of the place it was too depressing and i wasnt tired or anything so i went up to my room and put on my coat i also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in action but the lights and all were out now i went down in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to ernies ernies is this night club in greenwich village that my brother db used to go to quite frequently before he went out to hollywood and prostituted himself he used to take me with him once in a while ernies a big fat colored guy that plays the piano hes a terrific snob and he wont hardly even talk to you unless youre a big shot or a celebrity or something but he can really play the piano hes so good hes almost corny in fact i dont exactly know what i mean by that but i mean it i certainly like to hear him play but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over i think its because sometimes when he plays he sounds like the kind of guy that wont talk to you unless youre a big shot the cab i had was a real old one that smelled like someoned just tossed his cookies in it i always get those vomity kind of cabs if i go anywhere late at night what made it worse it was so quiet and lonesome out even though it was saturday night i didnt see hardly anybody on the street now and then you just saw a man and a girl crossing a street with their arms around each others waists and all or a bunch of hoodlumylooking guys and their dates all of them laughing like hyenas at something you could bet wasnt funny new yorks terribl e when somebody laughs on the street very late at night you can hear it for miles it makes you feel so lonesome and depressed i kept wishing i could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old phoebe but finally after i was riding a while the cab driver and i sort of struck up a conversation his name was horwitz he was a much better guy than the other driver id had anyway i thought maybe he might know about the ducks hey horwitz i said you ever pass by the lagoon in central park down by central park south the what the lagoon that little lake like there where the ducks are you know yeah what about it well you know the ducks that swim around in it in the springtime and all do you happen to know where they go in the wintertime by any chance where who goes the ducks do you know by any chance i mean does somebody come around in a truck or something and take them away or do they fly away by themselvesgo south or something old horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me he was a very impatienttype guy he wasnt a bad guy though how the hell should i know he said how the hell should i know a stupid thing like that well dont get sore about it i said he was sore about it or something whos sore nobodys sore i stopped having a conversation with him if he was going to get so damn touchy about it but he started it up again himself he turned all the way around again and said the fish dont go no place they stay right where they are the fish right in the goddam lake the fishthats different the fish is different im talking about the ducks i said whats different about it nothins different about it horwitz said everything he said he sounded sore about something its tougher for the fish the winter and all than it is for the ducks for chrissake use your head for chrissake i didnt say anything for about a minute then i said all right what do they do the fish and all when that whole little lakes a solid block of ice people skating on it and all old horwitz turned around again what the hellaya mean what do they do he yelled at me they stay right where they are for chrissake they cant just ignore the ice they cant just ignore it whos ignoring it nobodys ignoring it horwitz said he got so damn excited and all i was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something they live right in the goddam ice its their nature for chrissake they get frozen right in one position for the whole winter yeah what do they eat then i mean if theyre frozen solid they cant swim around looking for food and all their bodies for chrissakewhatsa matter with ya their bodies take in nutrition and all right through the goddam seaweed and crap thats in the ice they got their pores open the whole time thats their nature for chrissake see what i mean he turned way the hell around again to look at me oh i said i let it drop i was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi up or something besides he was such a touchy guy it wasnt any pleasure discussing anything with him would you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere i said he didnt answer me though i guess he was still thinking i asked him again though he was a pretty good guy quite amusing and all i aint got no time for no liquor bud he said how the hell old are you anyways why aintcha home in bed im not tired when i got out in front of ernies and paid the fare old horwitz brought up the fish again he certainly had it on his mind listen he said if you was a fish mother natured take care of you wouldnt she right you dont think them fish just die when it gets to be winter do ya no but youre goddam right they dont horwitz said and drove off like a bat out of hell he was about the touchiest guy i ever met everything you said made him sore even though it was so late old ernies was jampacked mostly with prep school jerks and college jerks almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for christmas vacation than the schools i go to you could hardly check your coat it was so crowded it was pretty quiet though because ernie was playing the piano it was supposed to be something holy for gods sake when he sat down at the piano nobodys that good about three couples besides me were waiting for tables and they were all shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old ernie while he played he had a big damn mirror in front of the piano with this big spotlight on him so that everybody could watch his face while he played you couldnt see his fingers while he playedjust his big old face big deal im not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing when i came in but whatever it was he was really stinking it up he was putting all these dumb showoffy ripples in the high notes and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives me a pain in the ass you shouldve heard the crowd though when he was finished you wouldve puked they went mad they were exactly the same morons that laugh like hyenas in the movies at stuff that isnt funny i swear to god if i were a piano player or an actor or something and all those dopes thought i was terrific id hate it i wouldnt even want them to clap for me people always clap for the wrong things if i were a piano player id play it in the goddam closet anyway when he was finished and everybody was clapping their heads off old ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very phony humble bow like as if he was a he lluva humble guy besides being a terrific piano player it was very phonyi mean him being such a big snob and all in a funny way though i felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished i dont even think he knows any more when hes playing right or not it isnt all his fault i partly blame all those dopes that clap their heads offtheyd foul up anybody if you gave them a chance anyway it made me feel depressed and lousy again and i damn near got my coat back and went back to the hotel but it was too early and i didnt feel much like being all alone they finally got me this stinking table right up against a wall and behind a goddam post where you couldnt see anything it was one of those tiny little tables that if the people at the next table dont get up to let you byand they never do the bastards you practically have to climb into your chair i ordered a scotch and soda which is my favorite drink next to frozen daiquiris if you were only around six years old you could get liquor at ernies the place was so dark and all and besides nobody cared how old you were you could even be a dope fiend and nobodyd care i was surrounded by jerks im not kidding at this other tiny table right to my left practically on top of me there wa s this funnylooking guy and this funnylooking girl they were around my age or maybe just a little older it was funny you could see they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast i listened to their conversation for a while because i didnt have anything else to do he was telling her about some pro football game hed seen that afternoon he gave her every single goddam play in the whole gameim not kidding he was the most boring guy i ever listened to and you could tell his date wasnt even interested in the goddam game but she was even funnierlooking than he was so i guess she had to listen real ugly girls have it tough i feel so sorry for them sometimes sometimes i cant even look at them especially if theyre with some dopey guy thats telling them all about a goddam football game on my right the conversation was even worse though on my right there was this very joe yalelooking guy in a gray flannel suit and one of those flittylooking tattersall vests all those ivy league bastards look alike my father wants me to go to yale or maybe princeton but i swear i wouldnt go to one of those ivy league colleges if i was dying for gods sake anyway this joe yalelooki ng guy had a terrificlooking girl with him boy she was goodlooking but you shouldve heard the conversation they were having in the first place they were both slightly crocked what he was doing he was giving her a feel under the table and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide his date kept saying to him how horrible dont darling please dont not here imagine giving somebody a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time they killed me i certainly began to feel like a prize horses ass though sitting there all by myself there wasnt anything to do except smoke and drink what i did do though i told the waiter to ask old ernie if hed care to join me for a drink i told him to tell him i was dbs brother i dont think he ever even gave him my message though those bastards never give your message to anybody all of a sudden this girl came up to me and said holden caulfield her name was lillian simmons my brother db used to go around with her for a while she had very big knockers hi i said i tried to get up naturally but it was some job getting up in a place like that she had some navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass how marvelous to see you old lillian simmons said strictly a phony hows your big brother thats all she really wanted to know hes fine hes in hollywood in hollywood how marvelous whats he doing i dont know writing i said i didnt feel like discussing it you could tell she thought it was a big deal his being in ho llywood almost everybody does mostly people whove never read any of his stories it drives me crazy though how exciting old lillian said then she introduced me to the navy guy his name was commander blop or something he was one of those guys that think theyre being a pansy if they dont break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with you god i hate that stuff are you all alone baby old lillian asked me she was blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle you could tell she liked to block up a lot of traffic this waiter was waiting for her to move out of the way but she didnt even notice him it was funny you could tell the waiter didnt like her much you could tell even the navy guy didnt like her much even though he was dating her and i didnt like her much nobody did you had to feel sort of sorry for her in a way dont you have a date baby she asked me i was standing up now and she didnt even tell me to sit down she was the type that keeps you standing up for hours isnt he handsome she said to the navy guy holden youre getting handsomer by the minute the navy guy told her to come on he told her they were blocking up the whole aisle holden come join us old lillian said bring your drink i was just leaving i told her i ha ve to meet somebody you could tell she was just trying to get in good with me so that id tell old db about it well you little soandso all right for you tell your big brother i hate him when you see him then she left the navy guy and i told each other we were glad tove met each other which always kills me im always saying glad tove met you to somebody im not at all glad i met if you want to stay alive you have to say that stuff though after id told her i had to meet somebody i didnt have any goddam choice except to leave i couldnt even stick around to hear old ernie play something halfway decent but i certainly wasnt going to sit down at a table with old lillian simmons and that navy guy and be bored to death so i left it made me mad though when i was getting my coat people are always ruining things for you i walked all the way back to the hotel fortyone gorgeous blocks i didnt do it because i felt like walking or anything it was more because i didnt feel like getting in and out of another taxicab sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the same way you get tired riding in elevators all of a sudden you have to walk no matter how far or how high up when i was a kid i used to walk all the way up to our apartment very frequently twelve stories you wouldnt even have known it had snowed at all there was hardly any snow on the sidewalks but it was freezing cold and i took my red hunting hat out of my pocket and put it oni didnt give a damn how i looked i even put the earlaps down i wished i knew whod swiped my gloves at pencey because my hands were freezing not that id have done much about it even if i had known im one of these very yellow guys i try not to show it but i am for instance if id found out at pencey whod stolen my gloves i probably wouldve gone down to the crooks room and said okay how bout handing over those gloves then the crook that had stolen them probably wouldve said his voice very innocent and all what gloves then what i probably wouldve done id have gone in his closet and found the gloves somewhere hidden in his goddam galoshes or something for instance id have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said i suppose these are your goddam gloves then the crook probably wouldve given me this very phony innocent look and said i never saw those gloves before in my life if theyre yours take em i dont want the goddam things then i probably wouldve just stood there for about five minutes id have the damn gloves right in my hand and all but id feel i ought to sock the guy in the jaw or somethingbreak his goddam jaw only i wouldnt have the guts to do it id just stand there trying to look tough what i might do i might say something very cutting and snotty to rile him upinstead of socking him in the jaw anyway if i did say something very cutting and snotty hed probably get up and come over to me and say listen caulfield are you calling me a crook then instead of saying youre goddam right i am you dirty crooked bastard all i probably wouldve said would be all i know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes right away then the guy would know for sure that i wasnt going to take a sock at him and he probably wouldve said listen lets get this straight are you calling me a thief then i probably wouldve said nobodys calling anybody a thief all i know is my gloves were in your goddam galoshes it could go on like that for hours finally though id leave his room without even taking a sock at him id probably go down to the can and sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror anyway thats what i thought about the whole way back to the hotel its no fun to he yellow maybe im not all yellow i dont know i think maybe im just partly yellow and partly the type that doesnt give much of a damn if they lose their gloves one of my troubles is i never care too much when i lose somethingit used to drive my mother crazy when i was a kid some guys spend days looking for something they lost i never seem to have anything that if i lost it id care too much maybe thats why im partly yellow its no excuse though it really isnt what you should be is not yellow at all if youre supposed to sock somebody in the jaw and you sort of feel like doing it you should do it im just no good at it though id rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw i hate fist fights i dont mind getting hit so muchalthough im not crazy about it naturallybut what scares me most in a fist fight is the guys face i cant stand looking at the other guys face is my trouble it wouldnt be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something its a funny kind of yellowness when you come to think of it but its yellowness all right im not kidding myself the more i thought about my gloves and my yellowness the more depressed i got and i decided while i was walking and all to stop off and have a drink somewhere id only had three drinks at ernies and i didn t even finish the last one one thing i have its a terrific capacity i can drink all night and not even show it if im in the mood once at the whooton school this other boy raymond goldfarb and i bought a pint of scotch and drank it in the chapel one saturday night where nobodyd see us he got stinking but i hardly didnt even show it i just got very cool and nonchalant i puked before i went to bed but i didnt really have toi forced myself anyway before i got to the hotel i started to go in this dumpylooking bar but two guys came out drunk as hell and wanted to know where the subway was one of them was this very cubanlooking guy and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my face while i gave him directions i ended up not even going in the damn bar i just went back to the hotel the whole lobby was empty it smelled like fifty million dead cigars it really did i wasnt sleepy or anything but i was feeling sort of lousy depressed and all i almost wished i was dead then all of a sudden i got in this big mess the first thing when i got in the elevator the elevator guy said to me innarested in having a good time fella or is it too late for you how do you mean i said i didnt know what he was driving at or anything innarested in a little tail tnight me i said which was a very dumb answer but its quite embarrassing when somebody comes right up and asks you a question like that how old are you chief the elevator guy said why i said twentytwo uh huh well how bout it yinnarested five bucks a throw fifteen bucks the whole night he looked at his wrist watch till noon five bucks a throw fifteen bucks till noon okay i said it was against my principles and all but i was feeling so depressed i didnt even think thats the whole trouble when youre feeling very depressed you cant even think okay what a throw or till noon i gotta know just a throw okay what room ya in i looked at the red thing with my number on it on my key twelve twentytwo i said i was already sort of sorry id let the thing start rolling but it was too late now okay ill send a girl up in about fifteen minutes he opened the doors and i got out hey is she goodlooking i asked him i dont want any old bag no old bag dont worry about it chief who do i pay her he said lets go chief he shut the doors practically right in my face i went to my room and put some water on my hair but you cant really comb a crew cut or anything then i tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarettes and the scotch and sodas i drank at ernies all you do is hold your hand under your mouth and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils it didnt seem to stink much but i brushed my teeth anyway then i put on another clean shirt i knew i didnt have to get all dolled up for a prostitute or anything but it sort of gave me something to do i was a little nervous i was starting to feel pretty sexy and all but i was a little nervous anyway if you want to know the truth im a virgin i really am ive had quite a few opportunities to lose my virginity and all but ive never got around to it yet something always happens for instance if youre at a girls house her parents always come home at the wrong timeor youre afraid they will or if youre in the back seat of somebodys car theres always somebodys date in the front seatsome girl i meanthat always wants to know whats going on all over the whole goddam car i mean some girl in front keeps turning around to see what the hells going on anyway something always happens i came quite close to doing it a couple of times though one time in particular i remember something went wrong though i dont even remember what any more the thing is most of the time when youre coming pretty close to doing it with a girla girl that isnt a prostitute or anything i meanshe keeps telling you to stop the trouble with me is i stop most guys dont i cant help it you never know whether they really want you to stop or whether theyre just scared as hell or whether theyre just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it the blamell be on you not them anyway i keep stopping the trouble is i get to feeling sorry for them i mean most girls are so dumb and all after you neck them for a while you can really watch them losing their brains you take a girl when she really gets passionate she just hasnt any brains i dont know they tell me to stop so i stop i always wish i hadnt after i take them home but i keep doing it anyway anyway while i was putting on another clean shirt i sort of figured this was my big chance in a way i figured if she was a prostitute and all i could get in some practice on her in case i ever get married or anything i worry about that stuff sometimes i read this book once at the whooton school that had this very sophisticated suave sexy guy in it monsieur blanchard was his name i can still remember it was a lousy book but this blanchard guy was pretty good he had this big château and all on the riviera in europe and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club he was a real rake and all but he knocked women out he said in this one part that a womans body is like a violin and all and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right it was a very corny booki realize thatbut i couldnt get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway in a way thats why i sort of wanted to get some practice in in case i ever get married caulfield and his magic violin boy its corny i realize but it isnt too corny i wouldnt mind being pretty good at that stuff half the time if you really want to know the truth when im horsing around with a girl i have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what im looking for for gods sake if you know what i mean take this girl that i just missed having sexual intercourse with that i told you about it took me about an hour to just get her goddam brassiere off by the time i did get it off she was about ready to spit in my eye anyway i kept walking around the room waiting for this prostitute to show up i kept hoping shed be goodlooking i didnt care t oo much though i sort of just wanted to get it over with finally somebody knocked on the door and when i went to open it i had my suitcase right in the way and i fell over it and damn near broke my knee i always pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something when i opened the door this prostitute was standing there she had a polo coat on and no hat she was sort of a blonde but you could tell she dyed her hair she wasnt any old bag though how do you do i said suave as hell boy you the guy maurice said she asked me she didnt seem too goddam friendly is he the elevator boy yeah she said yes i am come in wont you i said i was getting more and more nonchalant as it went along i really was she came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed she had on a green dress underneath then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down she crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down she was very nervous for a prostitute she really was i think it was because she was young as hell she was around my age i sat down in the big chair next to her and offered her a cigarette i dont smoke she said she had a tiny little wheenywhiny voice you could hardly hear her she never said thank you either when you offered her something she just didnt know any better allow me to introduce myself my name is jim steele i said ya got a watch on ya she said she didnt care what the hell my name was naturally hey how old are you anyways me twentytwo like fun you are it was a funny thing to say it sounded like a real kid youd think a prostitute and all would say like hell you are or cut the crap instead of like fun you are how old are you i asked her old enough to know better she said she was really witty ya got a watch on ya she asked me again and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head i certainly felt peculiar when she did that i mean she did it so sudden and all i know youre supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody gets up and pulls their dress over their head but i didnt sexy was about the last thing i was feeling i felt much more depressed than sexy ya got a watch on ya hey no no i dont i said boy was i feeling peculiar whats your name i asked her all she had on was this pink slip it was really quite embarrassing it really was sunny she said lets go hey dont you feel like talking for a while i asked her it was a childish thing to say but i was feeling so damn peculiar are you in a very big hurry she looked at me like i was a madman what the heck ya wanna talk about she said i dont know nothing special i just thought perhaps you might care to chat for a while she sat down in the chair next to the desk again she didnt like it though you could tell she started jiggling her foot againboy she was a nervous girl would you care for a cigarette now i said i forgot she didnt smoke i dont smoke listen if youre gonna talk do it i got things to do i couldnt think of anything to talk about though i thought of asking her how she got to be a prostitute and all but i was scared to ask her she probably wouldntve told me anyway you dont come from new york do you i said finally thats all i could think of hollywood she said then she got up and went over to where shed put her dress down on the bed ya got a hanger i dont want to get my dress all wrinkly its brandclean sure i said right away i was only too glad to get up and do something i took her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her it was funny it made me feel sort of sad when i hung it up i thought of her going in a store and buying it and nobody in the store knowing she was a prostitute and all the salesman probably just thought she was a regular girl when she bought it it made me feel sad as helli dont know why exactly i sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going she was a lousy conversationalist do you work every night i asked herit sounded sort of awful after id said it yeah she was walking all around the room she picked up the menu off the desk and read it what do you do during the day she sort of shrugged her shoulders she was pretty skinny sleep go to the show she put down the menu and looked at me lets go hey i havent got all look i said i dont feel very much like myself tonight ive had a rough night honest to god ill pay you and all but do you mind very much if we dont do it do you mind very much the trouble was i just didnt want to do it i felt more depressed than sexy if you want to know the truth she was depressing her green dress hanging in the closet and all and besides i dont think i could ever do it with somebody that sits in a stupid movie all day long i really dont think i could she came over to me with this funny look on her face like as if she didnt believe me whatsa matter she said nothings the matter boy was i getting nervous the thing is i had an operation very recently yeah where on my wuddayacallitmy clavichord yeah where the hells that the clavichord i said well actually its in the spinal canal i mean its quite a ways down in the spinal canal yeah she said thats tough then she sat down on my goddam lap youre cute she made me so nervous i just kept on lying my head off im still recuperating i told her you look like a guy in the movies you know whosis you know who i mean what the hecks his name i dont know i said she wouldnt get off my goddam lap sure you know he was in that pitcher with melvine douglas the one that was melvine douglass kid brother that falls off this boat you know who i mean no i dont i go to the movies as seldom as i can then she started getting funny crude and all do you mind cutting it out i said im not in the mood i just told you i just had an operation she didnt get up from my lap or anything but she gave me this terrifically dirty look listen she said i was sleepin when that crazy maurice woke me up if you think im i said id pay you for coming and all i really will i have plenty of dough its just that im practically just recovering from a very serious what the heck did you tell that crazy maurice you wanted a girl for then if you just had a goddam operation on your goddam wuddayacallit huh i thought id be feeling a lot better than i do i was a little premature in my calculations no kidding im sorry if youll just get up a second ill get my wallet i mean it she was sore as hell but she got up off my goddam lap so that i could go over and get my wallet off the chiffonier i took out a fivedollar bill and handed it to her thanks a lot i told her thanks a million this is a five it costs ten she was getting funny you could tell i was afraid something like that would happeni really was maurice said five i told her he said fifteen till noon and only five for a throw ten for a throw he said five im sorryi really ambut thats all im gonna shell out she sort of shrugged her shoulders the way she did before and then she said very cold do you mind getting me my frock or would it be too much trouble she was a pretty spooky kid even with that little bitty voice she had she could sort of scare you a little bit if shed been a big old prostitu te with a lot of makeup on her face and all she wouldnt have been half as spooky i went and got her dress for her she put it on and all and then she picked up her polo coat off the bed so long crumbbum she said so long i said i didnt thank her or anything im glad i didnt after old sunny was gone i sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of cigarettes it was getting daylight outside boy i felt miserable i felt so depressed you cant imagine what i did i started talking sort of out loud to allie i do that sometimes when i get very depressed i keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in front of bobby fallons house bobby fallon used to live quite near us in mainethis is years ago anyway what happened was one day bobby and i were going over to lake sedebego on our bikes we were going to take our lunches and all and our bb gunswe were kids and all and we thought we coul d shoot something with our bb guns anyway allie heard us talking about it and he wanted to go and i wouldnt let him i told him he was a child so once in a while now when i get very depressed i keep saying to him okay go home and get your bike and meet me in front of bobbys house hurry up it wasnt that i didnt use to take him with me when i went somewhere i did but that one day i didnt he didnt get sore about ithe never got sore about anything but i keep thinking about it anyway when i get very depressed finally though i got undressed and got in bed i felt like praying or something when i was in bed but i couldnt do it i cant always pray when i feel like it in the first place im sort of an atheist i like jesus and all but i dont care too much for most of the other stuff in the bible take the disciples for instance they annoy the hell out of me if you want to know the truth they were all right after jesus was dead and all but while he was alive they were about as much use to him as a hole in the head all they did was keep letting him down i like almost anybody in the bible better than the disciples if you want to know the truth the guy i like best in the bible next to jesus was that lunatic and all that lived in the tombs and kept cutting himself with stones i like him ten times as much as the disciples that poor bastard i used to get in quite a few arguments about it when i was at whooton school with this boy that lived down the corridor arthur childs old childs was a quaker and all and he read the bible all the time he was a very nice kid and i liked him but i could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff in the bible especially the disciples he kept telling me if i didnt like the disciples then i didnt like jesus and all he said that because jesus picked the disciples you were supposed to like them i said i knew he picked them but that he picked them at random i said he didnt have time to go around analyzing everybody i said i wasnt blaming jesus or anything it wasnt his fault that he didnt have any time i remember i asked old childs if he thought judas the one that betrayed jesus and all went to hell after he committed suicide childs said certainly thats exactly where i disagreed with him i said id bet a thousand bucks that jesus never sent old judas to hell i still would too if i had a thousand bucks i think any one of the disciples wouldve sent him to hell and all and fast toobut ill bet anything jesus didnt do it old childs said the trouble with me was that i didnt go to church or anything he was right about that in a way i dont in the first place my parents are different religions and all the children in our family are atheists if you want to know the truth i cant even stand ministers the ones theyve had at every school ive gone to they all have these holy joe voices when they start giving their sermons god i hate that i dont see why the hell they cant talk in their natural voice they sound so phony when they talk anyway when i was in bed i couldnt pray worth a damn every time i got started i kept picturing old sunny calling me a crumbbum finally i sat up in bed and smoked another cigarette it tasted lousy i mustve smoked around two packs since i left pencey all of a sudden while i was laying there smoking somebody knocked on the door i kept hoping it wasnt my door they were knocking on but i knew damn well it was i dont know how i knew but i knew i knew who it was too im psychic whos there i said i was pretty scared im very yellow about those things they just knocked again though louder finally i got out of bed with just my pajamas on and opened the door i didnt even have to turn the light on in the room because it was already daylight old sunny and maurice the pimpy elevator guy were standing there whats the matter wuddaya want i said boy my voice was shaking like hell nothin much old maurice said just five bucks he did all the talking for the two of them old sunny just stood there next to him with her mouth open and all i paid her already i gave her five bucks ask her i said boy was my voice shaking its ten bucks chief i tole ya that ten bucks for a throw fifteen bucks till noon i tole ya that you did not tell me that you said five bucks a throw you said fifteen bucks till noon all right but i distinctly heard you open up chief what for i said god my old heart was damn near beating me out of the room i wished i was dressed at least its terrible to be just in your pajamas when something like that happens lets go chief old maurice said then he gave me a big shove with his crumby hand i damn near fell over on my canhe was a huge sonuvabitch the next thing i knew he and old sunny were both in the room they acted like they owned the damn place old sunny sat down on the window sill old maurice sat down in the big chair and loosened his collar and allhe was wearing this elevator operators uniform boy was i nervous all right chief lets have it i gotta get back to work i told you about ten times i dont owe you a cent i already gave her the five cut the crap now lets have it why should i give her another five bucks i said my voice was cracking all over the place youre trying to chisel me old maurice unbuttoned his whole uniform coat all he had on underneath was a phony shirt collar but no shirt or anything he had a big fat hairy stomach nobodys tryna chisel nobody he said lets have it chief no when i said that he got up from his chair and started walking towards me and all he looked like he was very very tired or very very bored god was i scared i sort of had my arms folded i remember it wouldnt have been so bad i dont think if i hadnt had just my goddam pajamas on lets have it chief he came right up to where i was standing thats all he could say lets have it chief he was a real moron no chief youre gonna force me inna roughin ya up a little bit i dont wanna do it but thats the way it looks he said you owe us five bucks i dont owe you five bucks i said if you rough me up ill yell like hell ill wake up everybody in the hotel the police and all my voice was shaking like a bastard go ahead yell your goddam head off fine old maurice said want your parents to know you spent the night with a whore highclass kid like you he was pretty sharp in his crumby way he really was leave me alone if youd said ten itd be different but you distinctly are ya gonna let us have it he had me right up against the damn door he was almost standing on top of me his crumby old hairy stomach and all leave me alone get the hell out of my room i said i still had my arms folded and all god what a jerk i was then sunny said something for the first time hey maurice want me to get his wallet she said its right on the wutchamacallit yeah get it leave my wallet alone i awreddy got it sunny said she waved five bucks at me see all im takin is the five you owe me im no crook all of a sudden i started to cry id give anything if i hadnt but i did no youre no crooks i said youre just stealing five shut up old maurice said and gave me a shove leave him alone hey sunny said cmon hey we got the dough he owes us lets go cmon hey im comin old maurice said but he didnt i mean it maurice hey leave him alone whos hurtin anybody he said innocent as hell then what he did he snapped his finger very hard on my pajamas i wont tell you where he snapped it but it hurt like hell i told him he was a goddam dirty moron whats that he said he put his hand behind his ear like a deaf guy whats that what am i i was still sort of crying i was so damn mad and nervous and all youre a dirty moron i said youre a stupid chiseling moron and in about two years youll be one of those scraggy guys that come up to you on the street and ask for a dime for coffee youll have snot all over your dirty filthy overcoat and youll be then he smacked me i didnt even try to get out of the way or duck or anything all i felt was this terrific punch in my stomach i wasnt knocked out or anything though because i remember looking up from the floor and seeing them both go out the door and shut it then i stayed on the floor a fairly long time sort of the way i did with stradlater only this time i thought i was dying i really did i thought i was drowning or something the trouble was i could hardly breathe when i did finally get up i had to walk to the bathroom all doubled up and holding onto my stomach and all but im crazy i swear to god i am about halfway to the bathroom i sort of started pretending i had a bullet in my guts old maurice had plugged me now i was on the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something to steady my nerves and help me really go into action i pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom dressed and all with my automatic in my pocket and staggering around a little bit then id walk downstairs instead of using the elevator id hold onto the banister and all with this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time what id do id walk down a few floorsholding onto my guts blood leaking all over the place and then id ring the elevator bell as soon as old maurice opened the doors hed see me with the automatic in my hand and hed start screaming at me in this very highpitched yellow belly voice to leave him alone but id plug him anyway six shots right through his fat hairy belly then id throw my automatic down the elevator shaftafter id wiped off all the finger prints and all then id crawl back to my room and call up jane and have her come over and bandage up my guts i pictured her holding a cigarette for me to smoke while i was bleeding and all the goddam movies they can ruin you im not kidding i stayed in the bathroom for about an hour taking a bath and all then i got back in bed it took me quite a while to get to sleepi wasnt even tiredbut finally i did what i really felt like though was committing suicide i felt like jumping out the window i probably wouldve done it too if id been sure somebodyd cover me up as soon as i landed i didnt want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me when i was all gory i didnt sleep too long because i think it was only around ten oclock when i woke up i felt pretty hungry as soon as i had a cigarette the last time id eaten was those two hamburgers i had with brossard and ackley when we went in to agerstown to the movies that was a long time ago it seemed like fifty years ago the phone was right next to me and i started to call down and have them send up some breakfast but i was sort of afraid they might send it up with old maurice if you think i was dying to see him again youre crazy so i just laid around in bed for a while and smoked another cigarette i thought of giving old jane a buzz to see if she was home yet and all but i wasnt in the mood what i did do i gave old sally hayes a buzz she went to mary a woodruff and i knew she was home because id had this letter from her a couple of weeks ago i wasnt too crazy about her but id known her for years i used to think she was quite intelligent in my stupidity the reason i did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff if somebody knows quite a lot about those things it takes you quite a while to find out whether theyre really stupid or not it took me years to find it out in old sallys case i think id have found it out a lot sooner if we hadnt necked so damn much my big trouble is i always sort of think whoever im necking is a pretty intelligent person it hasnt got a goddam thing to do with it but i keep thinking it anyway anyway i gave her a buzz first the maid answered then her father then she got on sally i said yeswho is this she said she was quite a little phony id already told her father who it was holden caulfield how are ya holden im fine how are you swell listen how are ya anyway i mean hows school fine she said i meanyou know swell well listen i was wondering if you were busy today its sunday but theres always one or two matinees going on sunday benefits and that stuff would you care to go id love to grand grand if theres one word i hate its grand its so phony for a second i was tempted to tell her to forget about the matinee but we chewed the fat for a while that is she chewed it you couldnt get a word in edgewise first she told me about some harvard guy it probably was a freshman but she didnt say naturallythat was rushing hell out of her calling her up night and day night and daythat killed me then she told me about some other guy some west point cadet that was cutting his throat over her too big deal i told her to meet me under the clock at the biltmore at two oclock and not to be late because the show probably started at twothirty she was always late then i hung up she gave me a pain in the ass but she was very goodlooking after i made the date with old sally i got out of bed and got dressed and packed my bag i took a look out the window before i left the room though to see how all the perverts were doing but they all had their shades down they were the heighth of modesty in the morning then i went down in the elevator and checked out i didnt see old maurice around anywhere i didnt break my neck looking for him naturally the bastard i got a cab outside the hotel but i didnt have the faintest damn idea where i was going i had no place to go it was only sunday and i couldnt go home till wednesday or tuesday the soonest and i certainly didnt feel like going to another hotel and getting my brains beat out so what i did i told the driver to take me to grand central station it was right near the biltmore where i was meeting sally later and i figured what id do id check my bags in one of those strong boxes that they give you a key to then get some breakfast i was sort of hungry while i was in the cab i took out my wallet and sort of counted my money i dont remember exactly what i had left but it was no fortune or anything id spent a kings ransom in about two lousy weeks i really had im a goddam spendthrift at heart what i dont spend i lose half the time i sort of even forget to pick up my change at restaurants and night clubs and all it drives my parents crazy you cant blame them my fathers quite wealthy though i dont know how much he makeshes never discussed that stuff with mebut i imagine quite a lot hes a corporation lawyer those boys really haul it in another reason i know hes quite well off hes always investing money in shows on broadway they always flop though and it drives my mother crazy when he does it she hasnt felt too healthy since my brother allie died shes very nervous thats another reason why i hated like hell for her to know i got the ax again after i put my bags in one of those strong boxes at the station i went into this little sandwich bar and bad breakfast i had quite a large breakfast for meorange juice bacon and eggs toast and coffee usually i just drink some orange juice im a very light eater i really am thats why im so damn skinny i was supposed to be on this diet where you eat a lot of starches and crap to gain weight and all but i didnt ever do it when im out somewhere i generally just eat a swiss cheese sandwich and a malted milk it isnt much but you get quite a lot of vitamins in the malted milk h v caulfield holden vitamin caulfield while i was eating my eggs these two nuns with suitcases and alli guessed they were moving to another convent or something and were waiting for a traincame in and sat down next to me at the counter they didnt seem to know what the hell to do with their suitcases so i gave them a hand they were these very inexpensivelooking suitcasesthe ones that arent genuine leather or anything it isnt important i know but i hate it when somebody has cheap suitcases it sounds terrible to say it but i can even get to hate somebody just looking at them if they have cheap suitcases with them something happened once for a while when i was at elkton hills i roomed with this boy dick slagle that had these very inexpensive suitcases he used to keep them under the bed instead of on the rack so that nobodyd see them standing next to mine it depressed holy hell out of me and i kept wanting to throw mine out or something or even trade with him mine came from mark cross and they were genuine cowhide and all that crap and i guess they cost quite a pretty penny but it was a funny thing heres what happened what i did i finally put my suitcases under my bed instead of on the rack so that old slagle wouldnt get a goddam inferiority complex about it but heres what he did the day after i put mine under my bed he took them out and put them back on the rack the reason he did it it took me a while to find out was because he wanted people to think my bags were his he really did he was a very funny guy that way he was always saying snotty things about them my suitcases for instance he kept saying they were too new and bourgeois that was his favorite goddam word he read it somewhere or heard it somewhere everything i had was bourgeois as hell even my fountain pen was bourgeois he borrowed it off me all the time but it was bourgeois anyway we only roomed together about two months then we both asked to be moved and the funny thing was i sort of missed him after we moved because he had a helluva good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes i wouldnt be surprised if he missed me too at first he only used to be kidding when he called my stuff bourgeois and i didnt give a damnit was sort of funny in fact then after a while you could tell he wasnt kidding any more the thing is its really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirsif yours are really good ones and theirs arent you think if theyre intelligent and all the other person and have a good sense of humor that they dont give a damn whose suitcases are better but they do they really do its one of the reasons why i roomed with a stupid bastard like stradlater at least his suitcases were as good as mine anyway these two nuns were sitting next to me and we sort of struck up a conversation the one right next to me had one of those straw baskets that you see nuns and salvation army babes collecting dough with around christmas time you see them standing on corners especially on fifth avenue in front of the big department stores and all anyway the one next to me dropped hers on the floor and i reached down and picked it up for her i asked her if she was out collecting money for charity and all she said no she said she couldnt get it in her suitcase when she was packing it and she was just carrying it she had a pretty nice smile when she looked at you she had a big nose and she had on those glasses with sort of iron rims that arent too attractive but she had a helluva kind face i thought if you were taking up a collection i told her i could make a small contribution you could keep the money for when you do take up a collection oh how very kind of you she said and the other one her friend looked over at me the other one was reading a little black book while she drank her coffee it looked like a bible but it was too skinny it was a bibletype book though all the two of them were eating for breakfast was toast and coffee that depressed me i hate it if im eating bacon and eggs or something and somebody else is only eating toast and coffee they let me give them ten bucks as a contribution they kept asking me if i was sure i could afford it and all i told them i had quite a bit of money with me but they didnt seem to believe me they took it though finally the both of them kept thanking me so much it was embarrassing i swung the conversation around to general topics and asked them where they were going they said they were schoolteachers and that theyd just come from chicago and that they were going to start teaching at some convent on th street or th street or one of those streets way the hell uptown the one next to me with the iron glasses said she taught english and her friend taught history and american government then i started wondering like a bastard what the one sitting next to me that taught english thought about being a nun and all when she read certain books for english books not necessarily with a lot of sexy stuff in them but books with lovers and all in them take old eustacia vye in the return of the native by thomas hardy she wasnt too sexy or anything but even so you cant help wondering what a nun maybe thinks about when she reads about old eustacia i didnt say anything though naturally all i said was english was my best subject oh really oh im so glad the one with the glasses that taught english said what have you read this year id be very interested to know she was really nice well most of the time we were on the anglosaxons beowulf and old grendel and lord randal my son and all those things but we had to read outside books for extra credit once in a while i read the return of the native by thomas hardy and romeo and juliet and julius oh romeo and juliet lovely didnt you just love it she certainly didnt sound much like a nun yes i did i liked it a lot there were a few things i didnt like about it but it was quite moving on the whole what didnt you like about it can you remember to tell you the truth it was sort of embarrassing in a way to be talking about romeo and juliet with her i mean that play gets pretty sexy in some parts and she was a nun and all but she asked me so i discussed it with her for a while well im not too crazy about romeo and juliet i said i mean i like them buti dont know they get pretty annoying sometimes i mean i felt much sorrier when old mercutio got killed than when romeo and juliet did the think is i never liked romeo too much after mercutio gets stabbed by that other manjuliets cousinwhats his name tybalt thats right tybalt i saidi always forget that guys name it was romeos fault i mean i liked him the best in the play old mercutio i dont know all those montagues and capulets theyre all rightespecially julietbut mercutio he wasits hard to explain he was very smart and entertaining and all the thing is it drives me crazy if somebody gets killed especially somebody very smart and entertaining and all and its somebody elses fault romeo and juliet at least it was their own fault what school do you go to she asked me she probably wanted to get off the subject of romeo and juliet i told her pencey and shed heard of it she said it was a very good school i let it pass though then the other one the one that taught history and government said theyd better be running along i took their check off them but they wouldnt let me pay it the one with the glasses made me give it back to her youve been more than generous she said youre a very sweet boy she certainly was nice she reminded me a little bit of old ernest morrows mother the one i met on the train when she smiled mostly weve enjoyed talking to you so much she said i said id enjoyed talking to them a lot too i meant it too id have enjoyed it even more though i think if i hadnt been sort of afraid the whole time i was talking to them that theyd all of a sudden try to find out if i was a catholic catholics are always trying to find out if youre a catholic it happens to me a lot i know partly because my last name is irish and most people of irish descent are catholics as a matter of fact my father was a catholic once he quit though when he married my mother but catholics are always trying to find out if youre a catholic even if they dont know your last name i knew this one catholic boy louis shaney when i was at the whooton school he was the first boy i ever met there he and i were sitting in the first two chairs outside the goddam infirmary the day school opened waiting for our physicals and we sort of struck up this conversation about tennis he was quite interested in tennis and so was i he told me he went to the nationals at forest hills every summer and i told him i did too and then we talked about certain hotshot tennis players for quite a while he knew quite a lot about tennis for a kid his age he really did then after a while right in the middle of the goddam conversation he asked me did you happen to notice where the catholic church is in town by any chance the thing was you could tell by the way he asked me that he was trying to find out if i was a catholic he really was not that he was prejudiced or anything but he just wanted to know he was enjoying the conversation about tennis and all but you could tell he wouldve enjoyed it more if i was a catholic and all that kind of stuff drives me crazy im not saying it ruined our conversation or anythingit didntbut it sure as hell didnt do it any good thats why i was glad those two nuns didnt ask me if i was a catholic it wouldnt have spoiled the conversation if they had but it wouldve been different probably im not saying i blame catholics i dont id be the same way probably if i was a catholic its just like those suitcases i was telling you about in a way all im saying is that its no good for a nice conversation thats all im saying when they got up to go the two nuns i did something very stupid and embarrassing i was smoking a cigarette and when i stood up to say goodby to them by mistake i blew some smoke in their face i didnt mean to but i did it i apologized like a madman and they were very polite and nice about it but it was very embarrassing anyway after they left i started getting sorry that id only given them ten bucks for their collection but the thing was id made that date to go to a matinee with old sally hayes and i needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff i was sorry anyway though goddam money it always ends up making you blue as hell after i had my breakfast it was only around noon and i wasnt meeting old sally till two oclock so i started taking this long walk i couldnt stop thinking about those two nuns i kept thinking about that beatup old straw basket they went around collecting money with when they werent teaching school i kept trying to picture my mother or somebody or my aunt or sally hayess crazy mother standing outside some department store and collecting dough for poor people in a beatup old straw basket it was hard to picture not so much my mother but those other two my aunts pretty charitableshe does a lot of red cross work and allbut shes very welldressed and all and when she does anything charitable shes always very welldressed and has lipstick on and all that crap i couldnt picture her doing anything for ch arity if she had to wear black clothes and no lipstick while she was doing it and old sally hayess mother jesus christ the only way she could go around with a basket collecting dough would be if everybody kissed her ass for her when they made a contribution if they just dropped their dough in her basket then walked away without saying anything to her ignoring her and all shed quit in about an hour shed get bored shed hand in her basket and then go someplace swanky for lunch thats what i liked about those nuns you could tell for one thing that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch it made me so damn sad when i thought about it their never going anywhere swanky for lunch or anything i knew it wasnt too important but it made me sad anyway i started walking over toward broadway just for the hell of it because i hadnt been over there in years besides i wanted to find a record store that was open on sunday there was this record i wanted to get for phoebe called little shirley beans it was a very hard record to get it was about a little kid that wouldnt go out of the house because two of her front teeth were out and she was ashamed to i heard it at pencey a boy that lived on the next floor had it and i tried to buy it off him because i knew it would knock old phoebe out but he wouldnt sell it it was a very old terrific record that this colored girl singer estelle fletcher made about twenty years ago she sings it very dixieland and whorehouse and it doesnt sound at all mushy if a white girl was singing it shed make it sound cute as hell but old estelle fletcher knew what the hell she was doing and it was one of the best records i ever heard i figured id buy it in some store that was open on sunday and then id take it up to the park with me it was sunday and phoebe goes rollerskating in the park on sundays quite frequently i knew where she hung out mostly it wasnt as cold as it was the day before but the sun still wasnt out and it wasnt too nice for walking but there was one nice thing this family that you could tell just came out of some church were walking right in front of mea father a mother and a little kid about six years old they looked sort of poor the father had on one of those pearlgray hats that poor guys wear a lot when they want to look sharp he and his wife were just walking along talking not paying any attention to their kid the kid was swell he was walking in the street instead of on the sidewalk but right next to the curb he was making out like he was walking a very straight line the way kids do and the whole time he kept singing and humming i got up closer so i could hear what he was singing he was singing that song if a body catch a body coming through the rye he had a pretty little voice too he was just singing for the hell of it you could tell the cars zoomed by brakes screeched all over the place his parents paid no attention to him and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing if a body catch a body coming through the rye it made me feel better it made me feel not so depressed any more broadway was mobbed and messy it wa s sunday and only about twelve oclock but it was mobbed anyway everybody was on their way to the moviesthe paramount or the astor or the strand or the capitol or one of those crazy places everybody was all dressed up because it was sunday and that made it worse but the worst part was that you could tell they all wanted to go to the movies i couldnt stand looking at them i can understand somebody going to the movies because theres nothing else to do but when somebody really wants to go and even walks fast so as to get there quicker then it depresses hell out of me especially if i see millions of people standing in one of those long terrible lines all the way down the block waiting with this terrific patience for seats and all boy i couldnt get off that goddam broadway fast enough i was lucky the first record store i went into had a copy of little shirley beans they charged me five bucks for it because it was so hard to get but i didnt care boy it made me so happy all of a sudden i could hardly wait to get to the park to see if old phoebe was around so that i could give it to her when i came out of the record store i passed this drugstore and i went in i figured maybe id give old jane a buzz and see if she was home for vacation yet so i went in a phone booth and called her up the only trouble was her mother answered the phone so i had to hang up i didnt feel like getting involved in a long conversation and all with her im not crazy about talking to girls mothers on the phone anyway i shouldve at least asked her if jane was home yet though it wouldnt have killed me but i didnt feel like it you really have to be in the mood for that stuff i still had to get those damn theater tickets so i bought a paper and looked up to see what shows were playing on account of it was sunday there were only about three shows playing so what i did was i went over and bought two orchestra seats for i know my love it was a benefit performance or something i didnt much want to see it but i knew old sally the queen of the phonies would start drooling all over the place when i told her i had tickets for that because the lunts were in it and all she liked shows that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all with the lunts and all i dont i dont like any shows very much if you want to know the truth theyre not as bad as movies but theyre certainly nothing to rave about in the first place i hate actors they never act like people they just think they do some of the good ones do in a very slight way but not in a way thats fun to watch and if any actors really good you can always tell he knows hes good and that spoils it you take sir laurence olivier for example i saw him in hamlet db took phoebe and i to see it last year he treated us to lunch first and then he took us hed already seen it and the way he talked about it at lunch i was anxious as hell to see it too but i didnt enjoy it much i just dont see whats so marvelous about sir laurence olivier thats all he has a terrific voice and hes a helluva handsome guy and hes very nice to watch when hes walking or dueling or something but he wasnt at all the way db said hamlet was he was too much like a goddam general instead of a sad screwedup type guy the best part in the whole picture was when old ophelias brotherthe one that gets in the duel with hamlet at the very end was going away and his father was giving him a lot of advice while the father kept giving him a lot of advice old ophelia wa s sort of horsing around with her brother taking his dagger out of the holster and teas ing him and all while he was trying to look interested in the bull his father was shooting that was nice i got a big bang out of that but you dont see that kind of stuff much the only thing old phoebe liked was when hamlet patted this dog on the head she thought that was funny and nice and it was what ill have to do is ill have to read that play the trouble with me is i always have to read that stuff by myself if an actor acts it out i hardly listen i keep worrying about whether hes going to do something phony every minute after i got the tickets to the lunts show i took a cab up to the park i shouldve taken a subway or something because i was getting slightly low on dough but i wanted to get off that damn broadway as fast as i could it was lousy in the park it wasnt too cold but the sun still wasnt out and there didnt look like there was anything in the park except dog crap and globs of spit and cigar butts from old men and the benches all looked like theyd be wet if you sat down on them it made you depressed and every once in a while for no reason you got goose flesh while you walked it didnt seem at all like christmas was coming soon it didnt seem like anything was coming but i kept walking over to the mall anyway because thats where phoebe usually goes when shes in the park she likes to skate near the bandstand its funny thats the same place i used to like to skate when i was a kid when i got there though i didnt see her around anywhere there were a few kids around skating and all and two boys were playing flys up with a soft ball but no phoebe i saw one kid about her age though sitting on a bench all by herself tightening her skate i thought maybe she might know phoebe and could tell me where she was or something so i went over and sat down next to her and asked her do you know phoebe caulfield by any chance who she said all she had on was jeans and about twenty sweaters you could tell her mother made them for her because they were lumpy as hell phoebe caulfield she lives on seventyfi rst street shes in the fourth grade over at you know phoebe yeah im her brother you know where she is shes in miss callons class isnt she the kid said i dont know yes i think she is shes probly in the museum then we went last saturday the kid said which museum i asked her she shrugged her shoulders sort of i dont know she said the museum i know but the one where the pictures are or the one where the indians are the one where the indians thanks a lot i said i got up and started to go but then i suddenly remembered it was sunday this is sunday i told the kid she looked up at me oh then she isnt she was having a helluva time tightening her skate she didnt have any gloves on or anything and her hands were all red and cold i gave her a hand with it boy i hadnt had a skate key in my hand for years it didnt feel funny though you could put a skate key in my hand fifty years from now in pitch dark and id still know what it is she thanked me and all when i had it tightened for her she was a very nice polite little kid god i love it when a kids nice and polite when you tighten their skate for them or something most kids are they really are i asked her if shed care to have a hot chocolate or something with me but she said no thank you she said she had to meet her friend kids always have to meet their friend that kills me even though it was sunday and phoebe wouldnt be there with her class or anything and even though it was so damp and lousy out i walked all the way through the park over to the museum of natural history i knew that was the museum the kid with the skate key meant i knew that whole museum routine like a book phoebe went to the same school i went to when i was a kid and we used to go there all the time we had this teacher miss aigletinger that took us there damn near every saturday sometimes we looked at the animals and sometimes we looked at the stuff the indians had made in ancient times pottery and straw baskets and all stuff like that i get very happy when i think about it even now i remember after we looked at all the indian stuff usually we went to see some movie in this big auditorium columbus they were always showing columbus discovering america having one helluva time getting old ferdinand and isabella to lend him the dough to buy ships with and then the sailors mutinying on him and all nobody gave too much of a damn about old columbus but you always had a lot of candy and gum and stuff with you and the inside of that auditorium had such a nice smell it always smelled like it was raining outside even if it wasnt and you were in the only nice dry cosy place in the world i loved that damn museum i remember you had to go through the indian room to get to the auditorium it was a long long room and you were only supposed to whisper the teacher would go first then the class youd be two rows of kids and youd have a partner most of the time my partner was this girl named gertrude levine she always wanted to hold your hand and her hand was always sticky or sweaty or something the floor was all stone and if you had some marbles in your hand and you dropped them they bounced like madmen all over the floor and made a helluva racket and the teacher would hold up the class and go back and see what the hell was going on she never got sore though miss aigletinger then youd pass by this long long indian war canoe about as long as three goddam cadillacs in a row with about twenty indians in it some of them paddling some of them just standing around looking tough and they all had war paint all over their faces there was one very spooky guy in the back of the canoe with a mask on he was the witch doctor he gave me the creeps but i liked him anyway another thing if you touched one of the paddles or anything while you were passing one of the guards would say to you dont touch anything children but he always said it in a nice voice not like a goddam cop or anything then youd pass by this big glass case with indians inside it rubbing sticks together to make a fire and a squaw weaving a blanket the squaw that was weaving the blanket was sort of bending over and you could see her bosom and all we all used to sneak a good look at it even the girls because they were only little kids and they didnt have any more bosom than we did then just before you went inside the auditorium right near the doors you passed this eskimo he was sitting over a hole in this icy lake and he was fishing through it he had about two fish right next to the hole that hed already caught boy that museum was full of glass cases there were even more upstairs with deer inside them drinking at water holes and birds flying south for the winter the birds nearest you were all stuffed and hung up on wires and the ones in back were just painted on the wall but they all looked like they were really flying south and if you bent your head down and sort of looked at them upside down they looked in an even bigger hurry to fly south the best thing though in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was nobodyd move you could go there a hundred thousand times and that eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish the birds would still be on their way south the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole with their pretty antlers and their pretty skinny legs and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket nobodyd be different the only thing that would be different would be you not that youd be so much older or anything it wouldnt be that exactly youd just be different thats all youd have an overcoat on this time or the kid that was your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and youd have a new partner or youd have a substitute taking the class instead of miss aigletinger or youd heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom or youd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them i mean youd be different in some wayi cant explain what i mean and even if i could im not sure id feel like it i took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while i walked and put it on i knew i wouldnt meet anybody that knew me and it was pretty damp out i kept walking and walking and i kept thinking about old phoebe going to that museum on saturdays the way i used to i thought how shed see the same stuff i used to see and how shed be different every time she saw it it didnt exactly depress me to think about it but it didnt make me feel gay as hell either certain things they should stay the way they are you ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone i know thats impossible but its too bad anyway anyway i kept thinking about all that while i walked i passed by this playground and stopped and watched a couple of very tiny kids on a seesaw one of them was sort of fat and i put my hand on the skinny kids end to sort of even up the weight but you could tell they didnt want me around so i let them alone then a funny thing happened when i got to the museum all of a sudden i wouldnt have gone inside for a million bucks it just didnt appeal to meand here id walked through the whole goddam park and looked forward to it and all if phoebed been there i probably would have but she wasnt so all i did in front of the museum was get a cab and go down to the biltmore i didnt feel much like going id made that damn date with sally though i was way early when i got there so i just sat down on one of those leather couches right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls a lot of schools were home for vacation already and there were about a million girls sitting and standing around waiting for their dates to show up girls with their legs crossed girls with their legs not crossed girls with terrific legs girls with lousy legs girls that looked like swell girls girls that looked like theyd be bitches if you knew them it was really nice sightseeing if you know what i mean in a way it was sort of depressing too because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them when they got out of school and college i mean you figured most of them would probably marry dopey guys guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at golf or even just some stupid game like pingpong guys that are very mean guys that never read books guys that are very boringbut i have to be careful about that i mean about calling certain guys bores i dont understand boring guys i really dont when i was at elkton hills i roomed for about two months with this boy harris mackim he was very intelligent and all but he was one of the biggest bores i ever met he had one of these very raspy voices and he never stopped talking practically he never st opped talking and what was awful was he never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place but he could do one thing the sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody i ever heard hed be making his bed or hanging up stuff in the closethe was always hanging up stuff in the closetit drove me crazyand hed be whistling while he did it if he wasnt talking in this raspy voice he could even whistle classical stuff but most of the time he just whistled jazz he could take something very jazzy like tin roof blues and whistle it so nice and easyright while he was hanging stuff up in the closetthat it could kill you naturally i never told him i thought he was a terrific whistler i mean you dont just go up to somebody and say youre a terrific whistler but i roomed with him for about two whole months even though he bored me till i was half crazy just because he was such a terrific whistler the best i ever heard so i dont know about bores maybe you shouldnt feel too sorry if you see some swell girl getting married to them they dont hurt anybody most of them and maybe theyre secretly all terrific whistlers or something who the hell knows not me finally old sally started coming up the stairs and i started down to meet her she looked terrific she really did she had on this black coat and sort of a black beret she hardly ever wore a hat but that beret looked nice the funny part is i felt like marrying her the minute i saw her im crazy i didnt even like her much and yet all of a sudden i felt like i was in love with her and wanted to marry her i swear to god im crazy i admit it holden she said its marvelous to see you its been ages she had one of these very loud embarrassing voices when you met her somewhere she got away with it because she was so damn goodlooking but it always gave me a pain in the ass swell to see you i said i meant it too how are ya anyway absolutely marvelous am i late i told her no but she was around ten minutes late as a matter of fact i didnt give a damn though all that crap they have in cartoons in the saturday evening post and all showing guys on street corners looking sore as hell because their dates are latethats bunk if a girl looks swell when she meets you who gives a damn if shes late nobody we better hurry i said the show starts at twoforty we started going down the stairs to where the taxis are what are we going to see she said i dont know the lunts its all i could get tickets for the lunts oh marvelous i told you shed go mad when she heard it was for the lunts we horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater at first she didnt want to because she had her lipstick on and all but i was being seductive as hell and she didnt have any alternative twice when the goddam cab stopped short in traffic i damn near fell off the seat those damn drivers never even look where theyre going i swear they dont then just to show you how crazy i am when we were coming out of this big clinch i told her i loved her and all it was a lie of course but the thing is i meant it when i said it im crazy i swear to god i am oh darling i love you too she said then right in the same damn breath she said promise me youll let your hair grow crew cuts are getting corny and your hairs so lovely lovely my ass the show wasnt as bad as some ive seen it was on the crappy side though it was about five hundred thousand years in the life of this one old couple it starts out when theyre young and all and the girls parents dont want her to marry the boy but she marries him anyway then they keep getting older and older the husband goes to war and the wife has this brother thats a drunkard i couldnt get very interested i mean i didnt care too much when anybody in the family died or anything they were all just a bunch of actors the husband and wife were a pretty nice old couplevery witty and allbut i couldnt get too interested in them for one thing they kept drinking tea or some goddam thing all through the play every time you saw them some butler was shoving some tea in front of them or the wife was pouring it for somebody and everybody kept coming in and going out all the timeyou got dizzy watching people sit down and stand up alfred lunt and lynn fontanne were the old couple and they were very good but i didnt like them much they were different though ill say that they didnt act like people and they didnt act like actors its hard to explain they acted more like they knew they were celebrities and all i mean they were good but they were too good when one of them got finished making a speech the other one said something very fast right after it it was supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each other and all the trouble was it was too much like people talking and interrupting each other they acted a little bit the way old ernie down in the village plays the piano if you do something too good then after a while if you dont watch it you start showing off and then youre not as good any more but anyway they were the only ones in the showthe lunts i meanthat looked like they had any real brains i have to admit it at the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerks for a cigarette what a deal that was you never saw so many phonies in all your life everybody smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and know how sharp they were some dopey movie actor was standing near us having a cigarette i dont know his name but he always plays the part of a guy in a war movie that gets yellow before its time to go over the top he was with some gorgeous blonde and the two of them were trying to be very blasé and all like as if he didnt even know people were looking at him modest as hell i got a big bang out of it old sally didnt talk much except to rave about the lunts because she was busy rubbering and being charming then all of a sudden she saw some jerk she knew on the other side of the lobby some guy in one of those very dark gray flannel suits and one of those checkered vests strictly ivy league big deal he was standing next to the wall smoking himself to death and looking bored as hell old sally kept saying i know that boy from somewhere she always knew somebody any place you took her or thought she did she kept saying that till i got bored as hell and i said to her why dont you go on over and give him a big soul kiss if you know him hell enjoy it she got sore when i said that finally though the jerk noticed her and came over and said hello you shouldve seen the way they said hello youd have thought they hadnt seen each other in twenty years youd have thought theyd taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids old buddyroos it was nauseating the funny part was they probably met each other just once at some phony party finally when they were all done slobbering around old sally introduced us his name was george somethingi dont even rememberand he went to andover big big deal you shouldve seen him when old sally asked him how he liked the play he was the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebodys question he stepped back and stepped right on the ladys foot behind him he probably broke every toe in her body he said the play itself was no masterpiece but that the lunts of course were absolute angels angels for chrissake angels that killed me then he and old sally started talking about a lot of people they both knew it was the phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life they both kept thinking of places as fast as they could then theyd think of somebody that lived there and mention their name i was all set to puke when it was time to go sit down again i really was and then when the next act was over they continued their goddam boring conversation they kept thinking of more places and more names of people that lived there the worst part was the jerk had one of those very phony ivy league voices one of those very tired snobby voices he sounded just like a girl he didnt hesitate to horn in on my date the bastard i even thought for a minute that he was going to get in the goddam cab with us when the show was over because he walked about two blocks with us but he had to meet a bunch of phonies for cocktails he said i could see them all sitting around in some bar with their goddam checkered vests criticizing shows and books and women in those tired snobby voices they kill me those guys i sort of hated old sally by the time we got in the cab after listening to that phony andover bastard for about ten hours i was all set to take her home and alli really was but she said i have a marvelous idea she was always having a marvelous idea listen she said what time do you have to be home for dinner i mean are you in a terrible hurry or anything do you have to be home any special time me no no special time i said truer word was never spoken boy why lets go iceskating at radio city thats the kind of ideas she always had iceskating at radio city you mean right now just for an hour or so dont you want to if you dont want to i didnt say i didnt want to i said sure if you want to do you mean it dont just say it if you dont mean it i mean i dont give a darn one way or the other not much she didnt you can rent those darling little skating skirts old sally said jeannette cultz did it last week thats why she was so hot to go she wanted to see herself in one of those little skirts that just come down over their butt and all so we went and after they gave us our skates they gave sally this little blue butt twitcher of a dress to wear she really did look damn good in it though i save to admit it and dont think she didnt know it the kept walking ahead of me so that id see how cute her little ass looked it did look pretty cute too i have to admit it the funny part was though we were the worst skaters on the whole goddam rink i mean the worst and there were some lulus too old sallys ankles kept bending in till they were practically on the ice they not only looked stupid as hell but they probably hurt like hell too i know mine did mine were killing me we mustve looked gorgeous and what made it worse there were at least a couple of hundred rubbernecks that didnt have anything better to do than stand around and watch everybody falling all over themselves do you want to get a table inside and have a drink or something i said to her finally thats the most marvelous idea youve had all day the said she was killing herself it was brutal i really felt sorry for her we took off our goddam skates and went inside this bar where you can get drinks and watch the skaters in just your stocking feet as soon as we sat down old sally took off her gloves and i gave her a cigarette she wasnt looking too happy the waiter came up and i ordered a coke for hershe didnt drinkand a scotch and soda for myself but the sonuvabitch wouldnt bring me one so i had a coke too then i sort of started lighting matches i do that quite a lot when im in a certain mood i sort of let them burn down till i cant hold them any more then i drop them in the ashtray its a nervous habit then all of a sudden out of a clear blue sky old sally said look i have to know are you or arent you coming over to help me trim the tree christmas eve i have to know she was still being snotty on account of her ankles when she was skating i wrote you i would youve asked me that about twenty times sure i am i mean i have to know she said she started looking all around the goddam room all of a sudden i quit lighting matches and sort of leaned nearer to her over the table i had quite a few topics on my mind hey sally i said what she said she was looking at some girl on the other side of the room did you ever get fed up i said i mean did you ever get scared that everything was going to go lousy unless you did something i mean do you like school and all that stuff its a terrific bore i mean do you hate it i know its a terrific bore but do you hate it is what i mean well i dont exactly hate it you always have to well i hate it boy do i hate it i said but it isnt just that its everything i hate living in new york and all taxicabs and madison avenue buses with the drivers and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door and being introduced to phony guys that call the lunts angels and going up a nd down in elevators when you just want to go outside and guys fitting your pants all the time at brooks and people always dont shout please old sally said which was very funny because i wasnt even shouting take cars i said i said it in this very quiet voice take most people theyre crazy about cars they worry if they get a little scratch on them and theyre always talking about how many miles they get to a gallon and if they get a brandnew car already they start thinking about trading it in for one thats even newer i dont even like old cars i mean they dont even interest me id rather have a goddam horse a horse is at least human for gods sake a horse you can at least i dont know what youre even talking about old sally said you jump from one you know something i said youre probably the only reason im in new york right now or anywhere if you werent around id probably be someplace way the hell off in the woods or some goddam place youre the only reason im around practically youre sweet she said but you could tell she wanted me to change the damn subject you ought to go to a boys school sometime try it sometime i said its full of phonies and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam cadillac some day and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques the guys that are on the basketball team stick together the catholics stick together the goddam intellectuals stick together the guys that play bridge stick together even the guys that belong to the goddam bookofthemonth club stick together if you try to have a little intelligent now listen old sally said lots of boys get more out of school than that i agree i agree they do some of them but thats all i get out of it see thats my point thats exactly my goddam point i said i dont get hardly anything out of anything im in bad shape im in lousy shape you certainly are then all of a sudden i got this idea look i said heres my idea how would you like to get the hell out of here heres my idea i know this guy down in greenwich village that we can borrow his car for a couple of weeks he used to go to the same school i did and he still owes me ten bucks what we could do is tomorrow morning we could drive up to massachusetts and vermont and all around there see its beautiful as hell up there it really is i was getting excited as hell the more i thought of it and i sort of reached over and took old sallys goddam hand what a goddam fool i was no kidding i said i have about a hundred and eighty bucks in the bank i can take it out when it opens in the morning and then i could go down and get this guys car no kidding well stay in these cabin camps and stuff like that till the dough runs out then when the dough runs out i could get a job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and later on we could get married or something i could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all honest to god we could have a terrific time wuddaya say cmon wuddaya say will you do it with me please you cant just do something like that old sally said she sounded sore as hell why not why the hell not stop screaming at me please she said which was crap because i wasnt even screaming at her why cantcha why not because you cant thats all in the first place were both practically children and did you ever stop to think what youd do if you didnt get a job when your money ran out wed starve to death the whole things so fantastic it isnt even it isnt fantastic id get a job dont worry about that you dont have to worry about that whats the matter dont you want to go with me say so if you dont it isnt that it isnt that at all old sally said i was beginning to hate her in a way well have oodles of time to do those thingsall those things i mean after you go to college and all and if we should get married and all therell be oodles of marvelous places to go to youre just no there wouldnt be there wouldnt be oodles of places to go to at all itd be entirely different i said i was getting depressed as hell again what she said i cant hear you one minute you scream at me and the next you i said no there wouldnt be marvelous places to go to after i went to college and all open your ears itd be entirely different wed have to go downstairs in elevators with suitcases and stuff wed have to phone up everybody and tell em goodby and send em postcards from hotels and all and id be working in some office making a lot of dough and riding to work in cabs and madison avenue buses and reading newspapers and playing bridge all the time and going to the movies and seeing a lot of stupid shorts and coming attractions and newsreels news reels christ almighty theres always a dumb horse race and some dame breaking a bottle over a ship and some chimpanzee riding a goddam bicycle with pants on it wouldnt be the same at all you dont see what i mean at all maybe i dont maybe you dont either old sally said we both hated each others guts by that time you could see there wasnt any sense trying to have an intelligent conversation i was sorry as hell id started it cmon lets get outa here i said you give me a royal pain in the ass if you want to know the truth boy did she hit the ceiling when i said that i know i shouldntve said it and i probably wouldntve ordinarily but she was depressing the hell out of me usually i never say crude things like that to girls boy did she hit the ceiling i apologized like a madman but she wouldnt accept my apology she was even crying which scared me a little bit because i was a little afraid shed go home and tell her father i called her a pain in the ass her father was one of those big s ilent bastards and he wasnt too crazy about me anyhow he once told old sally i was too goddam noisy no kidding im sorry i kept telling her youre sorry youre sorry thats very funny she said she was still sort of crying and all of a sudden i did feel sort of sorry id said it cmon ill take ya home no kidding i can go home by myself thank you if you think id let you take me home youre mad no boy ever said that to me in my entire life the whole thing was sort of funny in a way if you thought about it and all of a sudden i did something i shouldnt have i laughed and i have one of these very loud stupid laughs i mean if i ever sat behind myself in a movie or something id probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up it made old sally madder than ever i stuck around for a while apologizing and trying to get her to excuse me but she wouldnt she kept telling me to go away and leave her alone so finally i did it i went inside and got my shoes and stuff and left without her i shouldntve but i was pretty goddam fed up by that time if you want to know the truth i dont even know why i started all that stuff with her i mean about going away somewhere to massachusetts and vermont and all i probably wouldntve taken her even if shed wanted to go with me she wouldnt have been anybody to go with the terrible part though is that i meant it when i asked her thats the terrible part i swear to god im a madman when i left the skating rink i felt sort of hungry so i went in this drugstore and had a swiss cheese sandwich and a malted and then i went in a phone booth i thought maybe i might give old jane another buzz and see if she was home yet i mean i had the whole evening free and i thought id give her a buzz and if she was home yet take her dancing or something somewhere i never danced with her or anything the whole time i knew her i saw her dancing once though she looked like a very good dancer it was at this fourth of july dance at the club i didnt know her too well then and i didnt think i ought to cut in on her date she was dating this terrible guy al pike that went to choate i didnt know him too well but he was always hanging around the swimming pool he wore those white lastex kind of swimming trunks and he was always going off the high dive he did the same lousy old half gainer all day long it was the only dive he could do but he thought he was very hot stuff all muscles and no brains anyway thats who jane dated that night i couldnt understand it i swear i couldnt after we started going around together i asked her how come she could date a showoff bastard like al pike jane said he wasnt a showoff she said he had an inferiority complex she acted like she felt sorry for him or something and she wasnt just putting it on she meant it its a funny thing about girls every time you mention some guy thats strictly a bastardvery mean or very conceited and alland when you mention it to the girl shell tell you he has an inferiority complex maybe he has but that still doesnt keep him from being a bastard in my opinion girls you never know what theyre going to think i once got this girl roberta walshs roommate a date with a friend of mine his name was bob robinson and he really had an inferiority complex you could tell he was very ashamed of his parents and all because they said he dont and she dont and stuff like that and they werent very wealthy but he wasnt a bastard or anything he was a very nice guy but this roberta walshs roommate didnt like him at all she told roberta he was too conceitedand the reason she thought he was conceited was because he happened to mention to her that he was captain of the debating team a little thing like that and she thought he was conceited the trouble with girls is if they like a boy no matter how big a bastard he is theyll say he has an inferiority complex and if they dont like him no matter how nice a guy he is or how big an inferiority complex he has theyll say hes conceited even smart girls do it anyway i gave old jane a buzz again but her phone didnt answer so i had to hang up then i had to look through my address book to see who the hell might be available for the evening the trouble was though my address book only has about three people in it jane and this man mr antolini that was my teacher at elkton hills and my fathers office number i keep forgetting to put peoples names in so what i did finally i gave old carl luce a buzz he graduated from the whooton school after i left he was about three years older than i was and i didnt like him too much but he was one of these very intellectual guys he had the highest iq of any boy at whootonand i thought he might want to have dinner with me somewhere and have a slightly intellectual conversation he was very enlightening sometimes so i gave him a buzz he went to columbia now but he lived on th street and all and i knew hed be home when i got him on the phone he said he couldnt make it for dinner but that hed meet me for a drink at ten oclock at the wicker bar on th i think he was pretty surprised to hear from me i once called him a fatassed phony i had quite a bit of time to kill till ten oclock so what i did i went to the movies at radio city it was probably the worst thing i couldve done but it was near and i couldnt think of anything else i came in when the goddam stage show was on the rockettes were kicking their heads off the way they do when theyre all in line with their arms around each others waist the audience applauded like mad and some guy behind me kept saying to his wife you know what that is thats precision he killed me then after the rockettes a guy came out in a tuxedo and roller skates on and started skating under a bunch of little tables and telling jokes while he did it he was a very good skater and all but i couldnt enjoy it much because i kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that rollerskates on the stage it seemed so stupid i guess i just wasnt in the right mood then after him they had this christmas thing they have at radio city every year all these angels start coming out of the boxes and everywhere guys carrying crucifixes and stuff all over the place and the whole bunch of themthousands of themsinging come all ye faithful like mad big deal its supposed to be religious as hell i know and very pretty and all but i cant see anything religious or pretty for gods sake about a bunch of actors carrying crucifixes all over the stage when they were all finished and started going out the boxes again you could tell they could hardly wait to get a cigarette or something i saw it with old sally hayes the year before and she kept saying how beautiful it was the costumes and all i said old jesus probably wouldve puked if he could see itall those fancy costumes and all sally said i was a sacrilegious atheist i probably am the thing jesus really wouldve liked would be the guy that plays the kettle drums in the orchestra ive watched that guy since i was about eight years old my brother allie and i if we were with our parents and all we used to move our seats and go way down so we could watch him hes the best drummer i ever saw he only gets a chance to bang them a couple of times during a whole piece but he never looks bored when he isnt doing it then when he does bang them he does it so nice and sweet with this nervous expression on his face one time when we went to washington with my father allie sent him a postcard but ill bet he never got it we werent too sure how to address it after the christmas thing was over the goddam picture started it was so putrid i couldnt take my eyes off it it was about this english guy alec something that was in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all he comes out of the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place all over london not knowing who the hell he is hes really a duke but he doesnt know it then he meets this nice homey sincere girl getting on a bus her goddam hat blows off and he catches it and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about charles dickens hes both their favorite author and all hes carrying this copy of oliver twist and sos she i couldve puked anyway they fell in love right away on account of theyre both so nuts about charles dickens and all and he helps her run her publishing business shes a publisher the girl only shes not doing so hot because her brothers a drunkard and he spends all their dough hes a very bitter guy the brother because he was a doctor in the war and now he cant operate any more because his nerves are shot so he boozes all the time but hes pretty witty and all anyway old alec writes a book and this girl publishes it and they both make a hatful of dough on it theyre all set to get married when this other girl old marcia shows up marcia was alecs fiancée before he lost his memory and she recognizes him when hes in this store autographing books she tells old alec hes really a duke and all but he doesnt believe her and doesnt want to go with her to visit his mother and all his mothers blind as a bat but the other girl the homey one makes him go shes very noble and all so he goes but he still doesnt get his memory back even when his great dane jumps all over him and his mother sticks her fingers all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he was a kid but then one day some kids are playing cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with a cricket ball then right away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and kisses his mother on the forehead and all then he starts being a regular duke again and he forgets all about the homey babe that has the publishing business id tell you the rest of the story but i might puke if i did it isnt that id spoil it for you or anything there isnt anything to spoil for chrissake anyway it ends up with alec and the homey babe getting married and the brother thats a drunkard gets his nerves back and operates on alecs mother so she can see again and then the drunken brother and old marcia go for each other it ends up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their asses off because the great dane comes in with a bunch of puppies everybody thought it was a male i suppose or some goddam thing all i can say is dont see it if you dont want to puke all over yourself the part that got me was there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all through the goddam picture the phonier it got the more she cried youd have thought she did it because she was kindhearted as hell but i was sitting right next to her and she wasnt she had this little kid with her that was bored as hell and had to go to the bathroom but she wouldnt take him she kept telling him to sit still and behave himself she was about as kindhearted as a goddam wolf you take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies and nine times out of ten theyre mean bastards at heart im not kidding after the movie was over i started walking down to the wicker bar where i was supposed to meet old carl luce and while i walked i sort of thought about war and all those war movies always do that to me i dont think i could stand it if i had to go to war i really couldnt it wouldnt be too bad if theyd just take you out and shoot you or something but you have to stay in the army so goddam long thats the whole trouble my brother db was in the army for four goddam years he was in the war toohe landed on dday and allbut i really think he hated the army worse than the war i was practically a child at the time but i remember when he used to come home on furlough and all all he did was lie on his bed practically he hardly ever even came in the living room later when he went overseas and was in the war and all he didnt get wounded or anything and he didnt have to shoot anybody all he had to do was drive some cowboy general around all day in a command car he once told allie and i that if hed had to shoot anybody he wouldntve known which direc tion to shoot in he said the army was practically as full of bastards as the nazis were i remember allie once asked him wasnt it sort of good that he was in the war because he was a writer and it gave him a lot to write about and all he made allie go get his baseball mitt and then he asked him who was the best war poet rupert brooke or emily dickinson allie said emily dickinson i dont know too much about it myself because i dont read much poetry but i do know itd drive me crazy if i had to be in the army and be with a bunch of guys like ackley and stradlater and old maurice all the time marching with them and all i was in the boy scouts once for about a week and i couldnt even stand looking at the back of the guys neck in front of me they kept telling you to look at the back of the guys neck in front of you i swear if theres ever another war they better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing squad i wouldnt object what gets me about db though he hated the war so much and yet he got me to read this book a farewell to arms last summer he said it was so terrific thats what i cant understand it had this guy in it named lieutenant henry that was supposed to be a nice guy and all i dont see how db could hate the army and war and all so much and still like a phony like that i mean for instance i dont see how he could like a phony book like that and still like that one by ring lardner or that other one hes so crazy about the great gatsby db got sore when i said that and said i was too young and all to appreciate it but i dont think so i told him i liked ring lardner and the great gatsby and all i did too i was crazy about the great gatsby old gatsby old sport that killed me anyway im sort of glad theyve got the atomic bomb invented if theres ever another war im going to sit right the hell on top of it ill volunteer for it i swear to god i will in case you dont live in new york the wicker bar is in this sort of swanky hotel the seton hotel i used to go there quite a lot but i dont any more i gradually cut it out its one of those places that are supposed to be very sophisticated and all and the phonies are coming in the window they used to have these two french babes tina and janine come out and play the piano and sing about three times every night one of them played the pianostrictly lousyand the other one sang and most of the songs were either pretty dirty or in french the one that sang old janine was always whispering into the goddam microphone before she sang shed say and now we like to geeve you our impression of vooly voo fransay eet ees the story of a leetle fransh girl who comes to a beeg ceety just like new york and falls een love wees a leetle boy from brookleen we hope you like eet then when she was all done whispering and being cute as hell shed sing some dopey song half in english and half in french and drive all the phonies in the place mad with joy if you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and all you got to hate everybody in the world i swear you did the bartender was a louse too he was a big snob he didnt talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or a celebrity or something if you were a big shot or a celebrity or something then he was even more nauseating hed go up to you and say with this big charming smile like he was a helluva swell guy if you knew him well hows connecticut or hows florida it was a terrible place im not kidding i cut out going there entirely gradually it was pretty early when i got there i sat down at the barit was pretty crowdedand had a couple of scotch and sodas before old luce even showed up i stood up when i ordered them so they could see how tall i was and all and not think i was a goddam minor then i watched the phonies for a while some guy next to me was snowing hell out of the babe he was with he kept telling her she had aristocratic hands that killed me the other end of the bar was full of flits they werent too flittylookingi mean they didnt have their hair too long or anything but you could tell they were flits anyway finally old luce showed up old luce what a guy he was supposed to be my student adviser when i was at whooton the only thing he ever did though was give these sex talks and all late at night when there was a bunch of guys in his room he knew quite a bit about sex especially perverts and all he was always telling us about a lot of creepy guys that go around having affairs with sheep and guys that go around with girls pants sewed in the lining of their hats and all and flits and lesbians old luce knew who every flit and lesbian in the united states was all you had to do was mention somebodyanybody and old luced tell you if he was a flit or not sometimes it was hard to believe the people he said were flits and lesbians and all movie actors and like that some of the ones he said were flits were even married for gods sake youd keep saying to him you mean joe blows a flit joe blow that big tough guy that plays gangsters and cowboys all the time old luced say certainly he was always saying certainly he said it didnt matter if a guy was married or not he said half the married guys in the world were flits and didnt even know it he said you could turn into one practically overnight if you had all the traits and all he used to scare the hell out of us i kept waiting to turn into a flit or something the funny thing about old luce i used to think he was sort of flitty himself in a way he was always saying try this for size and then hed goose the hell out of you while you were going down the corridor and whenever he went to the can he always left the goddam door open and talked to you while you were brushing your teeth or something that stuffs so rt of flitty it really is ive known quite a few real flits at schools and all and theyre always doing stuff like that and thats why i always had my doubts about old luce he was a pretty intelligent guy though he really was he never said hello or anything when he met you the first thing he said when he sat down was that he could only stay a couple of minutes he said he had a date then he ordered a dry martini he told the bartender to make it very dry and no olive hey i got a flit for you i told him at the end of the bar dont look now i been saving him for ya very funny he said same old caulfield when are you going to grow up i bored him a lot i really did he amused me though he was one of those guys that sort of amuse me a lot hows your sex life i asked him he hated you to ask him stuff like that relax he said just sit back and relax for chrissake im relaxed i said hows columbia ya like it certainly i like it if i didnt like it i wouldnt have gone there he said he could be pretty boring himself sometimes whatre you majoring in i asked him perverts i was only horsing around whatre you trying to befunny no im only kidding i said listen hey luce youre one of these intellectual guys i need your advice im in a terrific he let out this big groan on me listen caulfield if you want to sit here and have a quiet peaceful drink and a quiet peaceful conver all right all right i said relax you could tell he didnt feel like discussing anything serious with me thats the trouble with these intellectual guys they never want to discuss anything serious unless they feel like it so all i did was i started discussing topics in general with him no kidding hows your sex life i asked him you still going around with that same babe you used to at whooton the one with the terrffic good god no he said how come what happened to her i havent the faintest idea for all i know since you ask shes probably the whore of new hampshire by this time that isnt nice if she was decent enough to let you get sexy with her all the time you at least shouldnt talk about her that way oh god old luce said is this going to be a typical caulfield conversation i want to know right now no i said but it isnt nice anyway if she was decent and nice enough to let you must we pursue this horrible trend of thought i didnt say anything i was sort of afraid hed get up and leave on me if i didnt shut up so all i did was i ordered another drink i felt like getting stinking drunk whore you going around with now i asked him you feel like telling me nobody you know yeah but who i might know her girl lives in the village sculptress if you must know yeah no kidding how old is she ive never asked her for gods sake well around how old i should imagine shes in her late thirties old luce said in her late thirties yeah you like that i asked him you like em that old the reason i was asking was because he really knew quite a bit about sex and all he was one of the few guys i knew that did he lost his virginity when he was only fourteen in nantucket he really did i like a mature person if thats what you mean certainly you do why no kidding they better for sex and all listen lets get one thing straight i refuse to answer any typical caulfield questions tonight when in hell are you going to grow up i didnt say anything for a while i let it drop for a while then old luce ordered another martini and told the bartender to make it a lot dryer listen how long you been going around with her this sculpture babe i asked him i was really interested did you know her when you were at whooton hardly she just arrived in this country a few months ago she did wheres she from she happens to be from shanghai no kidding she chinese for chrissake obviously no kidding do you like that her being chinese obviously why id be interested to knowi really would i simply happen to find eastern philosophy more satisfactory than western since you ask you do wuddaya mean philosophy ya mean sex and all you mean its better in china that what you mean not necessarily in china for gods sake the east i said must we go on with this inane conversation listen im serious i said no kidding whys it better in the east its too involved to go into for gods sake old luce said they simply happen to regard sex as both a physical and a spiritual experience if you think im so do i so do i regard it as a wuddayacallita physical and spiritual experience and all i really do but it depends on who the hell im doing it with if im doing it with somebody i dont even not so loud for gods sake caulfield if you cant manage to keep your voice down lets drop the whole all right but listen i said i was getting excited and i was talking a little too loud sometimes i talk a little loud when i get excited this is what i mean though i said i know its supposed to be physical and spiritual and artistic and all but what i mean is you cant do it with everybodyevery girl you neck with and alland make it come out that way can you lets drop it old luce said do you mind all right but listen take you and this chinese babe whats so good about you two drop it i said i was getting a little too personal i realize that but that was one of the annoying things about luce when we were at whooton hed make you describe the most personal stuff that happened to you but if you started asking him questions about himself he got sore these intellectual guys dont like to have an intellectual conversation with you unless theyre running the whole thing they always want you to shut up when they shut up and go back to your room when they go back to their room when i was at whooton old luce used to hate ityou really could tell he didwhen after he was finished giving his sex talk to a bunch of us in his room we stuck around and chewed the fat by ourselves for a while i mean the other guys and myself in somebody elses room old luce hated that he always wanted everybody to go back to their own room and shut up when he was finished being the big shot the thing he was afraid of he was afraid somebodyd say something smarter than he had he really amused me maybe ill go to china my sex life is lousy i said naturally your mind is immature it is it really is i know it i said you know what the trouble with me is i can never get really sexyi mean really sexywith a girl i dont like a lot i mean i have to like her a lot if i dont i sort of lose my goddam desire for her and all boy it really screws up my sex life something awful my sex life stinks naturally it does for gods sake i told you the last time i saw you what you need you mean to go to a psychoanalyst and all i said thats what hed told me i ought to do his father was a psychoanalyst and all its up to you for gods sake its none of my goddam business what you do with your life i didnt say anything for a while i was thinking supposing i went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all i said what would he do to me i mean what would he do to me he wouldnt do a goddam thing to you hed simply talk to you and youd talk to him for gods sake for one thing hed help you to recognize the patterns of your mind the what the patterns of your mind your mind runs in listen im not giving an elementary course in psychoanalysis if youre interested call him up and make an appointment if youre not dont i couldnt care less frankly i put my hand on his shoulder boy he amused me youre a real friendly bastard i told him you know that he was looking at his wrist watch i have to tear he said and stood up nice seeing you he got the bartender and told him to bring him his check hey i said just before he beat it did your father ever psychoanalyze you me why do you ask no reason did he though has he not exactly hes helped me to adjust myself to a certain extent but an extensive analysis hasnt been necessary why do you ask no reason i was just wondering well take it easy he said he was leaving his tip and all and he was starting to go have just one more drink i told him please im lonesome as hell no kidding he said he couldnt do it though he said he was late now and then he left old luce he was strictly a pain in the ass but he certainly had a good vocabulary he had the largest vocabulary of any boy at whooton when i was there they gave us a test i kept sitting there getting drunk and waiting for old tina and janine to come out and do their stuff but they werent there a flittylooking guy with wavy hair came out and played the piano and then this new babe valencia came out and sang she wasnt any good but she was better than old tina and janine and at least she sang good songs the piano was right next to the bar where i was sitting and all and old valencia was standing practically right next to me i sort of gave her the old eye but she pretended she didnt even see me i probably wouldnt have done it but i was getting drunk as hell when she was finished she beat it out of the room so fast i didnt even get a chance to invite her to join me for a drink so i called the headwaiter over i told him to ask old valencia if shed care to join me for a drink he said he would but he probably didnt even give her my message people never give your message to anybody boy i sat at that goddam bar till around one oclock or so getting drunk as a bastard i could hardly see straight the one thing i did though i was careful as hell not to get boisterous or anything i didnt want anybody to notice me or anything or ask how old i was but boy i could hardly see straight when i was really drunk i started that stupid business with the bullet in my guts again i was the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their guts i kept putting my hand under my jacket on my stomach and all to keep the blood from dripping all over the place i didnt want anybody to know i was even wounded i was concealing the fact that i was a wounded sonuvabitch finally what i felt like i felt like giving old jane a buzz and see if she was home yet so i paid my check and all then i left the bar and went out where the telephones were i kept keeping my hand under my jacket to keep the blood from dripping boy was i drunk but when i got inside this phone booth i wasnt much in the mood any more to give old jane a buzz i was too drunk i guess so what i did i gave old sally hayes a buzz i had to dial about twenty numbers before i got the right one boy was i blind hello i said when somebody answered the goddam phone i sort of yelled it i was so drunk who is this this very cold ladys voice said this is me holden caulfield lemme speaka sally please sallys asleep

said can you imagine how drunk i was i hung up too then i figured she probably just came home from a date i pictured her out with the lunts and all somewhere and that andover jerk all of them swimming around in a goddam pot of tea and saying sophisticated stuff to each other and being charming and phony i wished to god i hadnt even phoned her when im drunk im a madman i stayed in the damn phone booth for quite a while i kept holding onto the phone sort of so i wouldnt pass out i wasnt feeling too marvelous to tell you the truth finally though i came out and went in the mens room staggering around like a moron and filled one of the washbowls with cold water then i dunked my head in it right up to the ears i didnt even bother to dry it or anything i just let the sonuvabitch drip then i walked over to this radiator by the window and sat down on it it was nice and warm it felt good because i was shivering like a bastard its a funny thing i always shiver like hell when im drunk i didnt have anything else to do so i kept sitting on the radiator and counting these little white squares on the floor i was getting soaked about a gallon of water was dripping down my neck getting all over my collar and tie and all but i didnt give a damn i was too drunk to give a damn then pretty soon the guy that played the piano for old valencia this very wavyhaired flittylooking guy came in to comb his golden locks we sort of struck up a conversation while he was combing it except that he wasnt too goddam friendly hey you gonna see that valencia babe when you go back in the bar i asked him its highly probable he said witty bastard all i ever meet is witty bastards listen give her my compliments ask her if that goddam waiter gave her my message willya why dont you go home mac how old are you anyway eightysix listen give her my compliments okay why dont you go home mac not me boy you can play that goddam piano i told him i was just flattering him he played the piano stinking if you want to know the truth you oughta go on the radio i said handsome chap like you all those goddam golden locks ya need a manager go home mac like a good guy go home and hit the sack no home to go to no kiddingyou need a manager he didnt answer me he just went out he was all through combing his hair and patting it and all so he left like stradlater all these handsome guys are the same when theyre done combing their goddam hair they beat it on you when i finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hatcheck room i was crying and all i dont know why but i was i guess it was because i was feeling so damn depressed and lonesome then when i went out to the checkroom i couldnt find my goddam check the hatcheck girl was very nice about it though she gave me my coat anyway and my little shirley beans r ecordi still had it with me and all i gave her a buck for being so nice but she wouldnt take it she kept telling me to go home and go to bed i sort of tried to make a date with her for when she got through working but she wouldnt do it she said she was old enough to be my mother and all i showed her my goddam gray hair and told her i was fortytwoi was only horsing around naturally she was nice though i showed her my goddam red hunting hat and she liked it she made me put it on before i went out because my hair was still pretty wet she was all right i didnt feel too drunk any more when i went outside but it was getting very cold out again and my teeth started chattering like hell i couldnt make them stop i walked over to madison avenue and started to wait around for a bus because i didnt have hardly any money left and i had to start economizing on cabs and all but i didnt feel like getting on a damn bus and besides i didnt even know where i was supposed to go so what i did i started walking over to the park i figured id go by that little lake and see what the hell the ducks were doing see if they were around or not i still didnt know if they were around or not it wasnt far over to the park and i didnt have anyplace else special to go toi didnt even know where i was going to sleep yetso i went i wasnt tired or anything i just felt blue as hell then something terrible happened just as i got in the park i dropped old phoebes record it brokeinto about fifty pieces it wa s in a big envelope and all but it broke anyway i damn near cried it made me feel so terrible but all i did was i took the pieces out of the envelope and put them in my coat pocket they werent any good for anything but i didnt feel like just throwing them away then i went in the park boy was it dark ive lived in new york all my life and i know central park like the back of my hand because i used to rollerskate there all the time and ride my bike when i was a kid but i had the most terrific trouble finding th at lagoon that night i knew right where it wasit was right near central park south and allbut i still couldnt find it i mustve been drunker than i thought i kept walking and walking and it kept getting darker and darker and spookier and spookier i didnt see one person the whole time i was in the park im just as glad i probably wouldve jumped about a mile if i had then finally i found it what it was it was partly frozen and partly not frozen but i didnt see any ducks around i walked all around the whole damn lakei damn near fell in once in fact but i didnt see a single duck i thought maybe if there were any around they might be asleep or something near the edge of the water near the grass and all thats how i nearly fell in but i couldnt find any finally i sat down on this bench where it wasnt so goddam dark boy i was still shivering like a bastard and the back of my hair even though i had my hunting hat on was sort of full of little hunks of ice that worried me i thought probably id get pneumonia and die i started picturing millions of jerks coming to my funeral and all my grandfather from detroit that keeps calling out the numbers of the streets when you ride on a goddam bus with him and my auntsi have about fifty auntsand all my lousy cousins what a mobd be there they all came when allie died the whole goddam stupid bunch of them i have this one stupid aunt with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he looked lying there db told me i wasnt there i was still in the hospital i had to go to the hospital and all after i hurt my hand anyway i kept worrying that i was getting pneumonia with all those hunks of ice in my hair and that i was going to die i felt sorry as hell for my mother and father especially my mother because she still isnt over my brother allie yet i kept picturing her not knowing what to do with all my suits and athletic equipment and all the only good thing i knew she wouldnt let old phoebe come to my goddam funeral because she was only a little kid that was the only good part then i thought about the whole bunch of them sticking me in a goddam cemetery and all with my name on this tombstone and all surrounded by dead guys boy when youre dead they really fix you up i hope to hell when i do die somebody has sense enough to just dump me in the river or something anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery people coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on sunday and all that crap who wants flowers when youre dead nobody when the weathers nice my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of flowers on old allies grave i went with them a couple of times but i cut it out in the first place i certainly dont enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all it wasnt too bad when the sun was out but twicetwice we were there when it started to rain it was awful it rained on his lousy tombstone and it rained on the grass on his stomach it rained all over the place all the visitors that were visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their cars thats what nearly drove me crazy all the visitors could get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then go someplace nice for dinnereverybody except allie i couldnt stand it i know its only his body and all thats in the cemetery and his souls in heaven and all that crap but i couldnt stand it anyway i just wish he wasnt there you didnt know him if youd known him youd know what i mean its not too bad when the suns out but the sun only comes out when it feels like coming out after a while just to get my mind off getting pneumonia and all i took out my dough and tried to count it in the lousy light from the street lamp all i had was three singles and five quarters and a nickel leftboy i spent a fortune since i left pencey then what i did i went down near the lagoon and i sort of skipped the quarters and the nickel across it where it wasnt frozen i dont know why i did it but i did it i guess i thought itd take my mind off getting pneumonia and dying it didnt though i started thinking how old phoebe would f eel if i got pneumonia and died it was a childish way to think but i couldnt stop myself shed feel pretty bad if something like that happened she likes me a lot i mean shes quite fond of me she really is anyway i couldnt get that off my mind so finally what i figured id do i figured id better sneak home and see her in case i died and all i had my door key with me and all and i figured what id do id sneak in the apartment very quiet and all and just sort of chew the fat with her for a while the only thing that worried me was our front door it creaks like a bastard its a pretty old apartment house and the superintendents a lazy bastard and everything creaks and squeaks i was afraid my parents might hear me sneaking in but i decided id try it anyhow so i got the hell out of the park and went home i walked all the way it wasnt too far and i wasnt tired or even drunk any more it was just very cold and nobody around anywhere the best break i had in years when i got home the regular night elevator boy pete wasnt on the car some new guy id never seen was on the car so i figured that if i didnt bump smack into my parents and all id be able to say hello to old phoebe and then beat it and nobodyd even know id been around it was really a terrific break what made it even better the new elevator boy was sort of on the stupid side i told him in this very casual voice to take me up to the dicksteins the dicksteins were these people that had the other apartment on our floor id already taken off my hunting hat so as not to look suspicious or anything i went in the elevator like i was in a terrific hurry he had the elevator doors all shut and all and was all set to take me up and then he turned around and said they aint in theyre at a party on the fourteenth floor thats all right i said im supposed to wait for them im their nephew he gave me this sort of stupid suspicious look you better wait in the lobby fella he said id like toi really would i said but i have a bad leg i have to hold it in a certain position i think id better sit down in the chair outside their door he didnt know what the hell i was talking about so all he said was oh and took me up not bad boy its funny all you have to do is say something nobody understands and theyll do practically anything you want them to i got off at our floorlimping like a bastardand started walking over toward the dicksteins side then when i heard the elevator doors shut i turned around and went over to our side i was doing all right i didnt even feel drunk anymore then i took out my door key and opened our door quiet as hell then very very carefully and all i went inside and closed the door i really shouldve been a crook it was dark as hell in the foyer naturally and naturally i couldnt turn on any lights i had to be careful not to bump into anything and make a racket i certainly knew i was home though our foyer has a funny smell that doesnt smell like anyplace else i dont know what the hell it is it isnt cauliflower and it isnt perfumei dont know what the hell it isbut you always know youre home i started to take off my coat and hang it up in the foyer closet but that closets full of hangers that rattle like madmen when you open the door so i left it on then i started walking very very slowly back toward old phoebes room i knew the maid wouldnt hear me because she had only one eardrum she had this brother that stuck a straw down her ear when she was a kid she once told me she was pretty deaf and all but my parents especially my mother she has ears like a goddam bloodhound so i took it very very easy when i went past their door i even held my breath for gods sake you can hit my father over the head with a chair and he wont wake up but my mother all you have to do to my mother is cough somewhere in siberia and shell hear you shes nervous as hell half the time shes up all night smoking cigarettes finally after about an hour i got to old phoebes room she wasnt there though i forgot about that i forgot she always sleeps in dbs room when hes away in hollywood or some place she likes it because its the biggest room in the house also because it has this big old madman desk in it that db bought off some lady alcoholic in philadelphia and this big gigantic bed thats about ten miles wide and ten miles long i dont know where he bought that bed anyway old phoebe likes to sleep in dbs room when hes away and he lets her you ought to see her doing her homework or something at that crazy desk its almost as big as the bed you can hardly see her when shes doing her homework thats the kind of stuff she likes though she doesnt like her own room because its too little she says she says she likes to spread out that kills me whats old phoebe got to spread out nothing anyway i went into dbs room quiet as hell and turned on the lamp on the desk old phoebe didnt even wake up when the light was on and all i sort of looked at her for a while she was laying there asleep with her face sort of on the side of the pillow she had her mouth way open its funny you take adults they look lousy when theyre asleep and they have their mouths way open but kids dont kids look all right they can even have spit all over the pillow and they still look all right i went around the room very quiet and all looking at stuff for a while i felt swell for a change i didnt even feel like i was getting pneumonia or anything any more i just felt good for a change old phoebes clothes were on this chair right next to the bed shes very neat for a child i mean she doesnt just throw her stuff around like some kids shes no slob she had the jacket to this tan suit my mother bought her in canada hung up on the back of the chair then her blouse and stuff were on the seat her shoes and socks were on the floor right underneath the chair right next to each other i never saw the shoes before they were new they were these dark brown loafers sort of like this pair i have and they went swell with that suit my mother bought her in canada my mother dresses her nice she really does my mother has terrific taste in some things shes no good at buying ice skates or anything like that but clothes shes perfect i mean phoebe always has some dress on that can kill you you take most little kids even if their parents are wealthy and all they usually ha ve some terrible dress on i wish you could see old phoebe in that suit my mother bought her in canada im not kidding i sat down on old dbs desk and looked at the stuff on it it was mostly phoebes stuff from school and all mostly books the one on top was called arithmetic is fun i sort of opened the first page and took a look at it this is what old phoebe had on it phoebe weatherfield caulfield b that killed me her middle name is josephine for gods sake not weatherfield she doesnt like it though every time i see her shes got a new middle name for herself the book underneath the arithmetic was a geography and the book under the geography was a speller shes very good in spelling shes very good in all her subjects but shes best in spelling then under the speller there were a bunch of notebooks she has about five thousand notebooks you never saw a kid with so many notebooks i opened the one on top and looked at the first page it had on it bernice meet me at recess i have something very very important to tell you that was all there was on that page the next one had on it why has south eastern alaska so many caning factories because theres so much salmon why has it valuable forests because it has the right climate what has our government done to make life easier for the alaskan eskimos look it up for tomorrow phoebe weatherfield caulfield phoebe weatherfield caulfield phoebe weatherfield caulfield phoebe w caulfield phoebe weatherfield caulfield esq please pass to shirley shirley you said you were sagitarius but your only taurus bring your skates when you come over to my house i sat there on dbs desk and read the whole notebook it didnt take me long and i can read that kind of stuff some kids notebook phoebes or anybodys all day and all night long kids notebooks kill me then i lit another cigaretteit was my last one i mustve smoked about three cartons that day then finally i woke her up i mean i couldnt sit there on that desk for the rest of my life and besides i was afraid my parents might barge in on me all of a sudden and i wanted to at least say hello to her before they did so i woke her up she wakes up very easily i mean you dont have to yell at her or anything all you have to do practically is sit down on the bed and say wake up phoeb and bingo shes awake holden she said right away she put her arms around my neck and all shes very affectionate i mean shes quite affectionate for a child sometimes shes even too affectionate i sort of gave her a kiss and she said whenja get home she was glad as hell to see me you could tell not so loud just now how are ya anyway im fine did you get my letter i wrote you a fivepage yeahnot so loud thanks she wrote me this letter i didnt get a chance to answer it though it was all about this play she was in in school she told me not to make any dates or anything for friday so that i could come see it hows the play i asked her whatd you say the name of it was a christmas pageant for americans it stinks but im benedict arnold i have practically the biggest part she said boy was she wideawake she gets very excited when she tells you that stuff it starts out when im dying this ghost comes in on christmas eve and asks me if im ashamed and everything you know for betraying my country and everything are you coming to it she was sitting way the hell up in the bed and all thats what i wrote you about are you sure im coming certainly im coming daddy cant come he has to fly to california she said boy was she wideawake it only takes her about two seconds to get wideawake she was sittingsort of kneelingway up in bed and she was holding my goddam hand listen mother said youd be home wednesday she said she said wednesday i got out early not so loud youll wake everybody up what time is it they wont be home till very late mother said they went to a party in norwalk connecticut old phoebe sa id guess what i did this afternoon what movie i saw guess i dont knowlisten didnt they say what time theyd the doctor old phoebe said its a special movie they had at the lister foundation just this one day they had ittoday was the only day it was all about this doctor in kentucky and everything that sticks a blanket over this childs face thats a cripple and cant walk then they send him to jail and everything it was excellent listen a second didnt they say what time theyd he feels sorry for it the doctor thats why he sticks this blanket over her face and everything and makes her suffocate then they make him go to jail for life imprisonment but this child that he stuck the blanket over its head comes to visit him all the time and thanks him for what he did he was a mercy killer only he knows he deserves to go to jail because a doctor isnt supposed to take things away from god this girl in my classs mother took us alice holmborg shes my best friend shes the only girl in the whole wait a second willya i said im asking you a question did they say what time theyd be back or didnt they no but not till very late daddy took the car and everything so they wouldnt have to worry about trains we have a radio in it now except that mother said nobody can play it when the cars in traffic i began to relax sort of i mean i finally quit worrying about whether theyd catch me home or not i figured the hell with it if they did they did you shouldve seen old phoebe she had on these blue pajamas with red elephants on the collars elephants knock her out so it was a good picture huh i said swell except alice had a cold and her mother kept asking her all the time if she felt grippy right in the middle of the picture always in the middle of something important her motherd lean all over me and everything and ask alice if she felt grippy it got on my nerves then i told her about the record listen i bought you a record i told her only i broke it on the way home i took the pieces out of my coat pocket and showed her i was plastered i said gimme the pieces she said im saving them she took them right out of my hand and then she put them in the drawer of the night table she kills me db coming home for christmas i asked her he may and he may not mother said it all depends he may have to stay in hollywood and write a picture about annapolis annapolis for gods sake its a love story and everything guess whos going to be in it what movie star guess im not interested annapolis for gods sake whats db know about annapolis for gods sake whats that got to do with the kind of stories he writes i said boy that stuff drives me crazy that goddam hollywood whatd you do to your arm i asked her i noticed she had this big hunk of adhesive tape on her elbow the reason i noticed it her pajamas didnt have any sleeves this boy curtis weintraub thats in my class pushed me while i was going down the stairs in the park she said wanna see she started taking the crazy adhesive tape off her arm leave it alone whyd he push you down the stairs i dont know i think he hates me old phoebe said this other girl and me selma atterbury put ink and stuff all over his windbreaker that isnt nice what are youa child for gods sake no but every time im in the park he follows me everywhere hes always following me he gets on my nerves he probably likes you thats no reason to put ink all i dont want him to like me she said then she started looking at me funny holden she said how come youre not home wednesday what boy you have to watch her every minute if you dont think shes smart youre mad how come youre not home wednesday she asked me you didnt get kicked out or anything did you i told you they let us out early they let the whole you did get kicked out you did old phoebe said then she hit me on the leg with her fist she gets very fisty when she feels like it you did oh holden she had her hand on her mouth and all she gets very emotional i swear to god who said i got kicked out nobody said i you did you did she said then she smacked me again with her fist if you dont think that hurts youre crazy daddyll kill you she said then she flopped on her stomach on the bed and put the goddam pillow over her head she does that quite frequently shes a true madman sometimes cut it out now i said nobodys gonna kill me nobodys gonna evencmon phoeb take that goddam thing off your head nobodys gonna kill me she wouldnt take it off though you cant make her do something if she doesnt want to all she kept saying was daddy s gonna kill you you could hardly understand her with that goddam pillow over her head nobodys gonna kill me use your head in the first place im going away what i may do i may get a job on a ranch or something for a while i know this guy whose grandfathers got a ranch in colorado i may get a job out there i said ill keep in touch with you and all when im gone if i go cmon take that off your head cmon hey phoeb please please willya she wouldn t take it off though i tried pulling it off but shes strong as hell you get tired fighting with her boy if she wants to keep a pillow over her head she keeps it phoebe please cmon outa there i kept saying cmon hey hey weatherfield cmon out she wouldnt come out though you cant even reason with her sometimes finally i got up and went out in the living room and got some cigarettes out of the box on the table and stuck some in my pocket i was all out when i came back she had the pillow off her head all righti knew she would but she still wouldnt look at me even though she was laying on her back and all when i came around the side of the bed and sat down again she turned her crazy face the other way she was ostracizing the hell out of me just like the fencing team at pencey when i left all the goddam foils on the subway hows old hazel weatherfield i said you write any new stories about her i got that one you sent me right in my suitcase its down at the station its very good daddyll kill you boy she really gets something on her mind when she gets something on her mind no he wont the worst hell do hell give me hell again and then hell send me to that goddam military school thats all hell do to me and in the first place i wont even be around ill be away ill beill probably be in colorado on this ranch dont make me laugh you cant even ride a horse who cant sure i can certainly i can they can teach you in about two minutes i said stop picking at that she wa s picking at that adhesive tape on her arm who gave you that haircut i asked her i just noticed what a stupid haircut somebody gave her it was way too short none of your business she said she can be very snotty sometimes she can be quite snotty i suppose you failed in every single subject again she saidvery snotty it was sort of funny too in a way she sounds like a goddam schoolteacher sometimes and shes only a little child no i didnt i said i passed english then just for the hell of it i gave her a pinch on the behind it was sticking way out in the breeze the way she was laying on her side she has hardly any behind i didnt do it hard but she tried to hit my hand anyway but she missed then all of a sudden she said oh why did you do it she meant why did i get the ax again it made me sort of sad the way she said it oh god phoebe dont ask me im sick of everybody asking me that i said a million reasons why it was one of the worst schools i ever went to it was full of phonies and mean guys you never saw so many mean guys in your life for instance if you were having a bull session in somebodys room and somebody wanted to come in nobodyd let them in if they were some dopey pimply guy everybody was always locking their door when somebody wanted to come in and they had this goddam secret fraternity that i was too yellow not to joi n there was this one pimply boring guy robert ackley that wanted to get in he kept trying to join and they wouldnt let him just because he was boring and pimply i dont even feel like talking about it it was a stinking school take my word old phoebe didnt say anything but she was listen ing i could tell by the back of her neck that she was listening she always listens when you tell her something and the funny part is she knows half the time what the hell youre talking about she really does i kept talking about old pencey i sort of felt like it even the couple of nice teachers on the faculty they were phonies too i said there was this one old guy mr spencer hi s wife was always giving you hot chocolate and all that stuff and they were really pretty nice but you shouldve seen him when the headmaster old thurmer came in the history class and sat down in the back of the room he was always coming in and sitting down in the back of the room for about a half an hour he was supposed to be incognito or something after a while hed be sitting back there and then hed start interrupting what old spencer was saying to crack a lot of corny jokes old spencerd practically kill himself chuckling and smiling and all like as if thurmer was a goddam prince or something dont swear so much it wouldve made you puke i swear it would i said then on veterans day they have this day veterans day that all the jerks that graduated from pencey around come back and walk all over the place with their wives and children and everybody you shouldve seen this one old guy th at was about fifty what he did was he came in our room and knocked on the door and asked us if wed mind if he used the bathroom the bathroom was at the end of the corridori dont know why the hell he asked us you know what he said he said he wanted to see if his initials were still in one of the can doors what he did he carved his goddam stupid sad old initials in one of the can doors about ninety years ago and he wanted to see if they were still there so my roommate and i walked him down to the bathroom and all and we had to stand there while he looked for his initials in all the can doors he kept talking to us the whole time telling us how when he was at pencey they were the happiest days of his life and giving us a lot of advice for the future and all boy did he depress me i dont mean he was a bad guyhe wasnt but you dont have to be a bad guy to depress somebodyyou can be a good guy and do it all you have to do to depress somebody is give them a lot of phony advice while youre looking for your initials in some can doorthats all you have to do i dont know maybe it wouldnt have been so bad if he hadnt been all out of breath he was all out of breath from just climbing up the stairs and the whole time he was looking for his initials he kept breathing hard with his nostrils all funny and sad while he kept telling stradlater and i to get all we could out of pencey god phoebe i cant explain i just didnt like anything that was happening at pencey i cant explain old phoebe said something then but i couldnt hear her she had the side of her mouth right smack on the pillow and i couldnt hear her what i said take your mouth away i cant hear you with your mouth that way you dont like anything thats happening it made me even more depressed when she said that yes i do yes i do sure i do dont say that why the hell do you say that because you dont you dont like any schools you dont like a million things you dont i do thats where youre wrongthats exactly where youre wrong why the hell do you have to say that i said boy was she depressing me because you dont she said name one thing one thing one thing i like i said okay the trouble was i couldnt concentrate too hot sometimes its hard to concentrate one thing i like a lot you mean i asked her she didnt answer me though she was in a cockeyed position way the hell over the other side of the bed she was about a thousand miles away cmon answer me i said one thing i like a lot or one thing i just like you like a lot all right i said but the trouble was i couldnt concentrate about all i could think of were those two nuns that went around collecting dough in those beatup old straw baskets especially the one with the glasses with those iron rims and this boy i knew at elkton hills there was this one boy at elkton hills named james castle that wouldnt take back something he said about this very conceited boy phil stabile james castle called him a very conceited guy and one of stabiles lousy friends went and squealed on him to stabile so stabile with about six other dirty bastards went down to james castles room and went in and locked the goddam door and tried to make him take back what he said but he wouldnt do it so they started in on him i wont even tell you what they did to himits too repulsivebut he still wouldnt take it back old james castle and you shouldve seen him he was a skinny little weaklooking guy with wrists about as big as pencils finally what he did instead of taking back what he said he jumped out the window i was in the shower and all and even i could hear him land outside but i just thought something fell out the window a radio or a desk or something not a boy or anything then i heard everybody running through the corridor and down the stairs so i put on my bathrobe and i ran downstairs too and there was old james castle laying right on the stone steps and all he was dead and his teeth and blood were all over the place and nobody would even go near him he had on this turtleneck sweater id lent him all they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel them they didnt even go to jail that was about all i could think of though those two nuns i saw at breakfast and this boy james castle i knew at elkton hills the funny part is i hardly even know james castle if you want to know the truth he was one of these very quiet guys he was in my math class but he was way over on the other side of the room and he hardly ever got up to recite or go to the blackboard or anything some guys in school hardly ever get up to recite or go to the blackboard i think the only time i ever even had a conversation with him was that time he asked me if he could borrow this turtleneck sweater i had i damn near dropped dead when he asked me i was so surprised and all i remember i was brushing my teeth in the can when he asked me he said his cousin was coming in to take him for a drive and all i didnt even know he knew i had a turtleneck sweater all i knew about him was that his name was always right ahead of me at roll call cabel r cabel w castle caulfieldi can still remember it if you want to know the truth i almost didnt lend him my sweater just because i didnt know him too well what i said to old phoebe she said something to me but i didnt hear her you cant even think of one thing yes i can yes i can well do it then i like allie i said and i like doing what im doing right now sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff and allies deadyou always say that if somebodys dead and everything and in heaven then it isnt really i know hes dead dont you think i know that i can still like him though cant i just because somebodys dead you dont just stop liking them for gods sake especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know thatre alive and all old phoebe didnt say anything when she cant think of anything to say she doesnt say a goddam word anyway i like it now i said i mean right now sitting here with you and just chewing the fat and horsing that isnt anything really it is so something really certainly it is why the hell isnt it people never think anything is anything really im getting goddam sick of it stop swearing all right name something else name something youd like to be like a scientist or a lawyer or something i couldnt be a scientist im no good in science well a lawyerlike daddy and all lawyers are all right i guessbut it doesnt appeal to me i said i mean theyre all right if they go around saving innocent guys lives all the time and like that but you dont do that kind of stuff if youre a lawyer all you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy cars and dri nk martinis and look like a hotshot and besides even if you did go around saving guys lives and all how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys lives or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over the reporters and everybody the way it is in the dirty movies how would you know you werent being a phony the trouble is you wouldnt im not too sure old phoebe knew what the hell i was talking about i mean shes only a little child and all but she was listening at least if somebody at least listens its not too bad daddys going to kill you hes going to kill you she said i wasnt listening though i was thinking about something elsesomething crazy you know what id like to be i said you know what id like to be i mean if i had my goddam choice what stop swearing you know that song if a body catch a body comin through the rye id like its if a body meet a body coming through the rye old phoebe said its a poem by robert burns i know its a poem by robert burns she was right though it is if a body meet a body coming through the rye i didnt know it then though i thought it was if a body catch a body i said anyway i keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all thousands of little kids and nobodys aroundnobody big i meanexcept me and im standing on the edge of some crazy cliff what i have to do i have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliffi mean if theyre running and they dont look where theyre going i have to come out from somewhere and catch them thats all id do all day id just be the catcher in the rye and all i know its crazy but thats the only thing id really like to be i know its crazy old phoebe didnt say anything for a long time then when she said something all she said was daddys going to kill you i dont give a damn if he does i said i got up from the bed then because what i wanted to do i wanted to phone up this guy that was my english teacher at elkton hills mr antolini he lived in new york now he quit elkton hills he took this job teaching english at nyu i have to make a phone call i told phoebe ill be right back dont go to sleep i didnt want her to go to sleep while i was in the living room i knew she wouldnt but i said it anyway just to make sure while i was walking toward the door old phoebe said holden and i turned around she was sitting way up in bed she looked so pretty im taking belching lessons from this girl phyllis margulies she said listen i listened and i heard something but it wasnt much good i said then i went out in the living room and called up this teacher i had mr antolini i made it very snappy on the phone because i was afraid my parents would barge in on me right in the middle of it they didnt though mr antolini was very nice he said i could come right over if i wanted t o i think i probably woke he and his wife up because it took them a helluva long time to answer the phone the first thing he asked me was if anything was wrong and i said no i said id flunked out of pencey though i thought i might as well tell him he said good god when i said that he had a good sense of humor and all he told me to come right over if i felt like it he was about the best teacher i ever had mr antolini he was a pretty young guy not much older than my brother db and you could kid around with him without losing your respect for him he was the one that finally picked up that boy that jumped out the window i told you about james castle old mr antolini felt his pulse and all and then he took off his coat and put it over james castle and carried him all the way over to the infirmary he didnt even give a damn if his coat got all bloody when i got back to dbs room old phoebed turned the radio on this dance music was coming out shed turned it on low though so the maid wouldnt hear it you shouldve seen her she was sitting smack in the middle of the bed outside the covers with her legs folded like one of those yogi guys she was listening to the music she kills me cmon i said you feel like dancing i taught her how to dance and all when she was a tiny little kid shes a very good dancer i mean i just taught her a few things she learned it mostly by herself you cant teach somebody how to really dance you have shoes on she said ill take em off cmon she practically jumped off the bed and then she waited while i took my shoes off and then i danced with her for a while shes really damn good i dont like people that dance with little kids because most of the time it looks terrible i mean if youre out at a restaurant somewhere and you see some old guy take his little kid out on the dance floor usually they keep yanking the kids dress up in the back by mistake and the kid cant dance worth a damn anyway and it looks terrible but i dont do it out in public with phoebe or anything we just horse around in the house its different with her anyway because she can dance she can follow anything you do i mean if you hold her in close as hell so that it doesnt matter that your legs are so much longer she stays right with you you can cross over or do some corny dips or even jitterbug a little and she stays right with you you can even tango for gods sake we danced about four numbers in between numbers shes funny as hell she stays right in position she wont even talk or anything you both have to stay right in position and wait for the orchestra to start playing again that kills me youre not supposed to laugh or anything either anyway we danced about four numbers and then i turned off the radio old phoebe jumped back in bed and got under the covers im improving arent i she asked me and how i said i sat down next to her on the bed again i was sort of out of breath i was smoking so damn much i had hardly any wind she wasnt even out of breath feel my forehead she said all of a sudden why feel it just feel it once i felt it i didnt feel anything though does it feel very feverish she said no is it supposed to yesim making it feel it again i felt it again and i still didnt feel anything but i said i think its starting to now i didnt want her to get a goddam inferiority complex she nodded i can make it go up to over the thermoneter thermometer who said so alice holmborg showed me how you cross your legs and hold your breath and think of something very very hot a radiat or or something then your whole forehead gets so hot you can burn somebodys hand that killed me i pulled my hand away from her forehead like i was in terrific danger thanks for telling me i said oh i wouldntve burned your hand idve stopped before it got tooshhh then quick as hell she sat way the hell up in bed she scared hell out of me when she did that whats the matter i said the front door she said in this loud whisper its them i quick jumped up and ran over and turned off the light over the desk then i jammed out my cigarette on my shoe and put it in my pocket then i fanned hell out of the air to get the smoke outi shouldnt even have been smoking for gods sake then i grabbed my shoes and got in the closet and shut the door boy my heart was beating like a bastard i heard my mother come in the room phoebe she said now stop that i saw the light young lady hello i heard old phoebe say i couldnt sleep did you have a good time marvelous my mother said but you could tell she didnt mean it she doesnt enjoy herself much when she goes out why are you awake may i ask were you warm enough i was warm enough i just couldnt sleep phoebe have you been smoking a cigarette in here tell me the truth please young lady what old phoebe said you heard me i just lit one for one second i just took one puff then i threw it out the window why may i ask i couldnt sleep i dont like that phoebe i dont like that at all my mother said do you want another blanket no thanks gnight old phoebe said sh e was trying to get rid of her you could tell how was the movie my mother said excellent except alices mother she kept leaning over and asking her if she felt grippy during the whole entire movie we took a taxi home let me feel your forehead i didnt catch anything she didnt have anything it was just her mother well go to sleep now how was your dinner lousy phoebe said you heard what your father said about us ing that word what was lousy about it you had a lovely lamb chop i walked all over lexington avenue just to the lamb chop was all right but charlene always breathes on me whenever she puts something down she breathes all over the food and everything she breathes on everything well go to sleep give mother a kiss did you say your prayers i said them in the bathroom gnight good night go right to sleep now i have a splitting headache my mother said she gets headaches quite frequently she really does take a few aspirins old phoebe said holdenll be home on wednesday wont he so far as i know get under there now way down i heard my mother go out and close the door i waited a couple of minutes then i came out of the closet i bumped smack into old phoebe when i did it because it was so dark and she was out of bed and coming to tell me i hurt you i said you had to whisper now because they were both home i gotta get a move on i said i found the edge of the bed in the dark and sat down on it and started putting on my shoes i was pretty nervous i admit it dont go now phoebe whispered waitll theyre asleep no now nows the best time i said shell be in the bathroom and daddyll turn on the news or something nows the best time i could hardly tie my shoelaces i was so damn nervous not that they wouldve killed me or anything if theyd caught me home but it wouldve been very unpleasant and all where the hell are ya i said to old phoebe it was so dark i couldnt see her here she was standing right next to me i didnt even see her i got my damn bags at the station i said listen you got any dough phoeb im practically broke just my christmas dough for presents and all i havent done any shopping at all yet oh i didnt want to take her christmas dough you want some she said i dont want to take your christmas dough i can lend you some she said then i heard her over at dbs desk opening a million drawers and feeling around with her hand it was pitchblack it was so dark in the room if you go away you wont see me in the play she said her voice sounded funny when she said it yes i will i wont go way before that you think i wanna miss the play i said what ill do ill probably stay at mr antolinis house till maybe tuesday night then ill come home if i get a chance ill phone ya here old phoebe said she was trying to give me the dough but she couldnt find my hand where she put the dough in my hand hey i dont need all this i said just give me two bucks is all no kiddinghere i tried to give it back to her but she wouldnt take it you can take it all you can pay me back bring it to the play how much is it for gods sake eight dollars and eightyfive cents sixtyfive cents i spent some then all of a sudden i started to cry i couldnt help it i did it so nobody could hear me but i did it it scared hell out of old phoebe when i started doing it and she came over and tried to make me stop but once you get started you cant just stop on a goddam dime i was still sitting on the edge of the bed when i did it and she put her old arm around my neck and i put my arm around her too but i still couldnt stop for a long time i thought i was going to choke to death or something boy i scared hell out of poor old phoebe the damn window was open and ev erything and i could feel her shivering and all because all she had on was her pajamas i tried to make her get back in bed but she wouldnt go finally i stopped but it certainly took me a long long time then i finished buttoning my coat and all i told her id keep in touch with her she told me i could sleep with her if i wanted to but i said no that id better beat it that mr antolini was waiting for me and all then i took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her she likes those kind of crazy hats she didnt want to take it but i made her ill bet she slept with it on she really likes those kind of hats then i told her again id give her a buzz if i got a chance and then i left it was a helluva lot easier getting out of the house than it was getting in for some reason for one thing i didnt give much of a damn any more if they caught me i really didnt i figured if they caught me they caught me i almost wished they did in a way i walked all the way downstairs instead of taking the elevator i went down the back stairs i nearly broke my neck on about ten million garbage pails but i got out all right the elevator boy didnt even see me he probably still thinks im up at the dicksteins mr and mrs antolini had this very swanky apartment over on sutton place with two steps that you go down to get in the living room and a bar and all id been there quite a few times because after i left elkton hills mr antoilni came up to our house for dinner quite frequently to find out how i was getting along he wasnt married then then when he got married i used to play tennis with he and mrs antolini quite frequently out at the west side tennis club in forest hills long island mrs antolini belonged there she was lousy with dough she was about sixty years older than mr antolini but they seemed to get along quite well for one thing they were both very intellectual especially mr antolini except that he was more witty than intellectual when you were with him sort of like db mrs antolini was mostly serious she had asthma pretty bad they both read all dbs storiesmrs antolini tooand when db went to hollywood mr antolini phoned him up and told him not to go he went anyway though mr antolini said that anybody that could write like db had no business going out to hollywood thats exactly what i said practically i would have walked down to their house because i didnt want to spend any of phoebes christmas dough that i didnt have to but i felt funny when i got outside sort of dizzy so i took a cab i didnt want to but i did i had a helluva time even finding a cab old mr antolini answered the door when i rang the bellafter the elevator boy finally let me up the bastard he had on his bathrobe and slippers and he had a highball in one hand he was a pretty sophisticated guy and he was a pretty heavy drinker holden mboy he said my god hes grown another twenty inches fine to see you how are you mr antolini hows mrs antolini were both just dandy lets have that coat he took my coat off me and hung it up i expected to see a dayold infant in your arms nowhere to turn snowflakes in your eyelashes hes a very witty guy sometimes he turned around and yelled out to the kitchen lillian hows the coffee coming lillian was mrs antolinis first name its all ready she yelled back is that holden hello holden hello mrs antolini you were always yelling when you were there thats because the both of them were never in the same room at the same time it was sort of funny sit down holden mr antolini said you could tell he was a little oiled up the room looked like theyd just had a party glasses were all over the place and dishes with peanuts in them excuse the appearance of the place he said weve been entertaining some buffalo friends of mrs antolinis some buffaloes as a matter of fact i laughed and mrs antolini yelled something in to me from the kitchen but i couldnt hear her whatd she say i asked mr antolini she said not to look at her when she comes in she just arose from the sack have a cigarette are you smoking now thanks i said i took a cigarette from the box he offered me just once in a while im a moderate smoker ill bet you are he said he gave me a light from this big lighter off the table so you and pencey are no longer one he said he always said things that way sometimes it amused me a lot and sometimes it didnt he sort of did it a little bit too much i dont mean he wasnt witty or anythinghe wasbut sometimes it gets on your nerves when somebodys always saying things like so you and pencey are no longer one db does it too much sometimes too what was the trouble mr antolini asked me howd you do in english ill show you the door in short order if you flunked english you little ace composition writer oh i passed english all right it was mostly literature though i only wrote about two compositions the whole term i said i flunked oral expression though they had this course you had to take oral expression that i flunked why oh i dont know i didnt feel much like going into it i was still feeling sort of dizzy or something and i had a helluva headache all of a sudden i really did but you could tell he was interested so i told him a little bit about it its this course where each boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech you know spontaneous and all and if the boy digresses at all youre supposed to yell digression at him as fast as you can it just about drove me crazy i got an f in it why oh i dont know that digression business got on my nerves i dont know the trouble with me is i like it when somebody digresses its more interesting and all you dont care to have somebody stick to the point when he tells you something oh sure i like somebody to stick to the point and all but i dont like them to stick too much to the point i dont know i guess i dont like it when somebody sticks to the point all the time the boys that got the best marks in oral expression were the ones that stuck to the point all the timei admit it but there was this one boy richard kinsella he didnt stick to the point too much and they were always yelling digression at him it was terrible because in the first place he was a very nervous guyi mean he was a very nervous guyand his lips were always shaking whenever it was his time to make a speech and you could hardly hear him if you were sitting way in the back of the room when his lips sort of quit shaking a little bit though i liked his speeches better than anybody elses he practically flunked the course though too he got a d plus because they kept yelling digression at him all the time for instance he made this speech about this farm his father bought in vermont they kept yelling digression at him the whole time he was making it and this teacher mr vinson gave him an f on it because he hadnt told what kind of animals and vegetables and stuff grew on the farm and all what he did was richard kinsella hed start telling you all about that stuffthen all of a sudden hed start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle and how his uncle got polio and all when he was fortytwo years old and how he wouldnt let anybody come to see him in the hospital because he didnt want anybody to see him with a brace on it didnt have much to do with the farmi admit itbut it was nice its nice when somebody tells you about their uncle especially when they start out telling you about their fathers farm and then all of a sudden get more interested in their uncle i mean its dirty to keep yelling digression at him when hes all nice and excited i dont know its hard to explain i didnt feel too much like trying either for one thing i had this terrific headache all of a sudden i wished to god old mrs antolini would come in with the coffee thats something that annoys hell out of mei mean if somebody says the coffees all ready and it isnt holden one short faintly stuffy pedagogical question dont you think theres a time and place for everything dont you think if someone starts out to tell you about his fathers farm he should stick to his guns then get around to telling you about his uncles brace or if his uncles brace is such a provocative subject shouldnt he have selected it in the first place as his subjectnot the farm i didnt feel much like thinking and answering and all i had a headache and i felt lousy i even had sort of a stomachache if you want to know the truth yesi dont know i guess he should i mean i guess he shouldve picked his uncle as a subject instead of the farm if that interested him most but what i mean is lots of time you dont know what interests you most till you start talking about something that doesnt interest you most i mean you cant help it sometimes what i think is youre supposed to leave somebody alone if hes at least being interesting and hes getting all excited about something i like it when somebody gets excited about something its nice you just didnt know this teacher mr vinson he could drive you crazy sometimes him and the goddam class i mean hed keep telling you to unify and simplify all the time some things you just cant do that to i mean you cant hardly ever simplify and unify something just because somebody wants you to you didnt know this guy mr vinson i mean he was very intelligent and all but you could tell he didnt have too much brains coffee gentlemen finally mrs antolini said she came in carrying this tray with coffee and cakes and stuff on it holden dont you even peek at me im a mess hello mrs antolini i said i started to get up and all but mr antolini got hold of my jacket and pulled me back down old mrs antolinis hair was full of those iron curler jobs and she didnt have any lipstick or anything on she didnt look too gorgeous she looked pretty old and all ill leave this right here just dive in you two she said she put the tray down on the cigarette table pushing all these glasses out of the way hows your mother holden shes fine thanks i havent seen her too recently but the last i darling if holden needs anything everythings in the linen closet the top shelf im going to bed im exhausted mrs antolini said she looked it too can you boys make up the couch by yourselves well take care of everything you run along to bed mr antolini said he gave mrs antolini a kiss and she said goodby to me and went in the bedroom they were always kissing each other a lot in public i had part of a cup of coffee and about half of some cake that was as hard as a rock all old mr antolini had was another highball though he makes them strong too you could tell he may get to be an alcoholic if he doesnt watch his step i had lunch with your dad a couple of weeks ago he said all of a sudden did you know that no i didnt youre aware of course that hes terribly concerned about you i know it i know he is i said apparently before he phoned me hed just had a long rather harrowing letter from your latest headmaster to the effect that you were making absolutely no effort at all cutting classes coming unprepared to all your classes in general being an allaround i didnt cut any classes you werent allowed to cut any there were a couple of them i didnt attend once in a while like that oral expression i told you about but i didnt cut any i didnt feel at all like discussing it the coffee made my stomach feel a little better but i still had this awful headache mr antolini lit another cigarette he smoked like a fiend then he said frankly i dont know what the hell to say to you holden i know im very hard to talk to i realize that i have a feeling that youre riding for some kind of a terrible terrible fall but i dont honestly know what kind are you listening to me yes you could tell he was trying to concentrate and all it may be the kind where at the age of thirty you sit in some bar hating everybody who comes in looking as if he might have played football in college then again you may pick up just enough education to hate people who say its a secret between he and i or you may end up in some business office throwing paper clips at the nearest stenographer i just dont know but do you know what im driving at at all yes sure i said i did too but youre wrong about that hating business i mean about hating football players and all you really are i dont hate too many guys what i may do i may hate them for a little while like this guy stradlater i knew at pencey and this other boy robert ackley i hated them once in a whilei admit itbut it doesnt last too long is what i mean after a while if i didnt see them if they didnt come in the room or if i didnt see them in the dining room for a couple of meals i sort of missed them i mean i sort of missed them mr antolini didnt say anything for a while he got up and got another hunk of ice and put it in his drink then he sat down again you could tell he was thinking i kept wishing though that hed continue the conversation in the morning instead of now but he was hot people are mostly hot to have a discussion when youre not all right listen to me a minute now i may not word this as memorably as id like to but ill write you a letter about it in a day or two then you can get it all straight but listen now anyway he started concentrating again then he said this fall i think youre riding forits a special kind of fall a horrible kind the man falling isnt permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom he just keeps falling and falling the whole arrangements designed for men who at some time or other in their lives were looking for something their own environment couldnt supply them with or they thought their own environment couldnt supply them with so they gave up looking they gave it up before they ever really even got started you follow me yes sir sure yes he got up and poured some more booze in his glass then he sat down again he didnt say anything for a long time i dont want to scare you he said but i can very clearly see you dying nobly one way or another for some highly unworthy cause he gave me a funny look if i write something down for you will you read it carefully and keep it yes sure i said i did too i still have the paper he gave me he went over to this desk on the other side of the room and without sitting down wrote something on a piece of paper then he came back and sat down with the paper in his hand oddly enough this wasnt written by a practicing poet it was written by a psychoanalyst named wilhelm stekel heres what heare you still with me yes sure i am heres what he said the mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one he leaned over and handed it to me i read it right when he gave it to me and then i thanked him and all and put it in my pocket it was nice of him to go to all that trouble it really was the thing was though i didnt feel much like concentrating boy i felt so damn tired all of a sudden you could tell he wasnt tired at all though he was pretty oiled up for one thing i think that one of these days he said youre going to have to find out where you want to go and then youve got to start going there but immediately you cant afford to lose a minute not you i nodded because he was looking right at me and all but i wasnt too sure what he was talking about i was pretty sure i knew but i wasnt too positive at the time i was too damn tired and i hate to tell you he said but i think that once you have a fair idea where you want to go your first move will be to apply yourself in school youll have to youre a studentwhether the idea appeals to you or not youre in love with knowledge and i think youll find once you get past all the mr vineses and their oral comp mr vinsons i said he meant all the mr vinsons not all the mr vineses i shouldnt have interrupted him though all rightthe mr vinsons once you get past all the mr vinsons youre going to start getting closer and closerthat is if you want to and if you look for it and wait for itto the kind of information that will be very very dear to your heart among other things youll find that youre not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior youre by no means alone on that score youll be excited and stimulated to know many many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now happily some of them kept records of their troubles youll learn from themif you want to just as someday if you have something to offer someone will learn something from you its a beautiful reciprocal arrangement and it isnt education its history its poetry he stopped and took a big drink out of his highball then he started again boy he was really hot i was glad i didnt try to stop him or anything im not trying to tell you he said that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world its not so but i do say that educated and scholarly men if theyre brilliant and creative to begin withwhich unfortunately is rarely the casetend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative they tend to express themselves more clearly and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end andmost importantnine times out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker do you follow me at all yes sir he didnt say anything again for quite a while i dont know if youve ever done it but its sort of hard to sit around waiting for somebody to say something when theyre thinking and all it really is i kept trying not to yawn it wasnt that i was bored or anythingi wasntbut i was so damn sleepy all of a sudden something else an academic education will do for you if you go along with it any considerable distance itll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have what itll fit and maybe what it wont after a while youll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing for one thing it may save you an extraordinary amount of time trying on ideas that dont suit you arent becoming to you youll begin to know your true measurements and dress your mind accordingly then all of a sudden i yawned what a rude bastard but i couldnt help it mr antolini just laughed though cmon he said and got up well fix up the couch for you i followed him and he went over to this closet and tried to take down some sheets and blankets and stuff that was on the top shelf but he couldnt do it with this highball glass in his hand so he drank it and then put the glass down on the floor and then he took the stuff down i helped him bring it over to the couch we both made the bed together he wasnt too hot at it he didnt tuck anything in very tight i didnt care though i couldve slept standing up i was so tired howre all your women theyre okay i was being a lousy conversationalist but i didnt feel like it hows sally he knew old sally hayes i introduced him once shes all right i had a date with her this afternoon boy it seemed like twenty years ago we dont have too much in common any more helluva pretty girl what about that other girl the one you told me about in maine ohjane gallagher shes all right im probably gonna give her a buzz tomorrow we were all done making up the couch then its all yours mr antolini said i dont know what the hell youre going to do with those legs of yours thats all right im used to short beds i said thanks a lot sir you and mrs antolini really saved my life tonight you know where the bathroom is if theres anything you want just holler ill be in the kitchen for a whilewill the light bother you noheck no thanks a lot all right good night handsome gnight sir thanks a lot he went out in the kitchen and i went in the bathroom and got undressed and all i couldnt brush my teeth because i didnt have any toothbrush with me i didnt have any pajamas either and mr antolini forgot to lend me some so i just went back in the living room and turned off this little lamp next to the couch and then i got in bed with just my shorts on it was way too short for me the couch but i really couldve slept standing up without batting an eyelash i laid awake for just a couple of seconds thinking about all that stuff mr antolinid told me about finding out the size of your mind and all he was really a pretty smart guy but i couldnt keep my goddam eyes open and i fell asleep then something happened i dont even like to talk about it i woke up all of a sudden i dont know what time it was or anything but i woke up i felt something on my head some guys hand boy it really scared hell out of me what it was it was mr antolinis hand what he was doing was he was sitting on the floor right next to the couch in the dark and all and he was sort of petting me or patting me on the goddam head boy ill bet i jumped about a thousand feet what the hellya doing i said nothing im simply sitting here admiring whatre ya doing anyway i said over again i didnt know what the hell to say i mean i was embarrassed as hell how bout keeping your voice down im simply sitting here i have to go anyway i saidboy was i nervous i started putting on my damn pants in the dark i could hardly get them on i was so damn nervous i know more damn perverts at schools and all than anybody you ever met and theyre always being perverty when im around you have to go where mr antolini said he was trying to act very goddam casual and cool and all but he wasnt any too goddam cool take my word i left my bags and all at the station i think maybe id better go down and get them i have all my stuff in them theyll be there in the morning now go back to bed im going to bed myself whats the matter with you nothings the matter its just that all my money and stuffs in one of my bags ill be right back ill get a cab and be right back i said boy i was falling all over myself in the dark the thing is it isnt mine the money its my mothers and i dont be ridiculous holden get back in that bed im going to bed myself the money will be there safe and sound in the morn no no kidding i gotta get going i really do i was damn near all dressed already except that i couldnt find my tie i couldnt remember where id put my tie i put on my jacket and all without it old mr antolini was sitting now in the big chair a little ways away from me watching me it was dark and all and i couldnt see him so hot but i knew he was watching me all right he was still boozing too i could see his trusty highball glass in his hand youre a very very strange boy i know it i said i didnt even look around much for my tie so i went without it goodby sir i said thanks a lot no kidding he kept walking right behind me when i went to the front door and when i rang the elevator bell he stayed in the damn doorway all he said was that business about my being a very very strange boy again strange my ass then he waited in the doorway and all till the goddam elevator came i never waited so long for an elevator in my whole goddam life i swear i didnt know what the hell to talk about while i was waiting for the elevator and he kept standing there so i said im gonna start reading some good books i really am i mean you had to say something it was very embarrassing you grab your bags and scoot right on back here again ill leave the door unlatched thanks a lot i said gby the elevator was finally there i got in and went down boy i was shaking like a madman i was sweating too when something perverty like that happens i start sweating like a bastard that kind of stuffs happened to me about twenty times since i was a kid i cant stand it when i got outside it was just getting light out it was pretty cold too but it felt good because i was sweating so much i didnt know where the hell to go i didnt want to go to another hotel and spend all phoebes dough so finally all i did was i walked over to lexington and took the subway down to grand central my bags were there and all and i figured id sleep in that crazy waiting room where all the benches are so thats what i did it wasnt too bad for a while because there werent many people around and i could stick my feet up but i dont feel much like discussing it it wasnt too nice dont ever try it i mean it itll depress you i only slept till around nine oclock because a million people started coming in the waiting room and i had to take my feet down i cant sleep so hot if i have to keep my feet on the floor so i sat up i still had that headache it was even worse and i think i was more depressed than i ever was in my whole life i didnt want to but i started thinking about old mr antolini and i wondered what hed tell mrs antolini when she saw i hadnt slept there or anything that part didnt worry me too much though because i knew mr antolini was very smart and that he could make up something to tell her he could tell her id gone home or something that part didnt worry me much but what did worry me was the part about how id woke up and found him patting me on the head and all i mean i wondered if just maybe i was wrong about thinking be was making a flitty pass at ne i wondered if maybe he just liked to pat guys on the head when theyre asleep i mean how can you tell about that stuff for sure you cant i even started wondering if maybe i shouldve got my bags and gone back to his house the way id said i would i mean i started thinking that even if he was a flit he certainlyd been very nice to me i thought how he hadnt minded it when id called him up so late and how hed told me to come right over if i felt like it and how he went to all that trouble giving me that advice about finding out the size of your mind and all and how he was the only guy thatd even gone near that boy james castle i told you about when he was dead i thought about all that stuff and the more i thought about it the more depressed i got i mean i started thinking maybe i shouldve gone back to his house maybe he was only patting my head just for the hell of it the more i thought about it though the more depressed and screwed up about it i got what made it even worse my eyes were sore as hell they felt sore and burny from not getting too much sleep besides that i was getting sort of a cold and i didnt even have a goddam handkerchief with me i had some in my suitcase but i didnt feel like taking it out of that strong box and opening it up right in public and all there was this magazine that somebodyd left on the bench next to me so i started reading it thinking itd make me stop thinking about mr antolini and a million other things for at least a little while but this damn article i started reading made me feel almost worse it was all about hormones it described how you should look your face and eyes and all if your hormones were in good shape and i didnt look that way at all i looked exactly like the guy in the article with lousy hormones so i started getting worried about my hormones then i read this other article about how you can tell if you have cancer or not it said if you had any sores in your mouth that didnt heal pretty quickly it was a sign that you probably had cancer id had this sore on the inside of my lip for about two weeks so figured i was getting cancer that magazine was some little cheerer upper i finally quit reading it and went outside for a walk i figured id be dead in a couple of months because i had cancer i really did i was even positive i would be it certainly didnt make me feel too gorgeous it sort of looked like it wa s going to rain but i went for this walk anyway for one thing i figured i ought to get some breakfast i wasnt at all hungry but i figured i ought to at least eat something i mean at least get something with some vitamins in it so i started walking way over east where the pretty cheap restaurants are because i didnt want to spend a lot of dough while i was walking i passed these two guys that were unloading this big christmas tree off a truck one guy kept saying to the other guy hold the sonuvabitch up hold it up for chrissake it certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a christmas tree it was sort of funny though in an awful way and i started to sort of laugh it was about the worst thing i couldve done because the minute i started to laugh i thought i was going to vomit i really did i even started to but it went away i dont know why i mean i hadnt eaten anything unsanitary or like that and usually i have quite a strong stomach anyway i got over it and i figured id feel better if i had something to eat so i went in this very cheaplooking restaurant and had doughnuts and coffee only i didnt eat the doughnuts i couldnt swallow them too well the thing is if you get very depressed about something its hard as hell to swallow the waiter was very nice though he took them back without charging me i just drank the coffee then i left and started walking over toward fifth avenue it was monday and all and pretty near christmas and all the stores were open so it wasnt too bad walking on fifth avenue it was fairly christmasy all those scraggy looking santa clauses were standing on corn ers ringing those bells and the salvation army girls the ones that dont wear any lipstick or anything were tinging bells too i sort of kept looking around for those two nuns id met at breakfast the day before but i didnt see them i knew i wouldnt because theyd told me theyd come to new york to be schoolteachers but i kept looking for them anyway anyway it was pretty christmasy all of a sudden a million little kids were downtown with their mothers getting on and off buses and coming in and out of stores i wished old phoebe was around shes not little enough any more to go stark staring mad in the toy department but she enjoys horsing around and looking at the people the christmas before last i took her downtown shopping with me we had a helluva time i think it was in bloomingdales we went in the shoe department and we pretended sheold phoebe wanted to get a pair of those very high storm shoes the kind that have about a million holes to lace up we had the poor salesman guy going crazy old phoebe tried on about twenty pairs and each time the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up it was a dirty trick but it killed old phoebe we finally bought a pair of moccasins and charged them the salesman was very nice about it i think he knew we were horsing around because old phoebe always starts giggling anyway i kept walking and walking up fifth avenue without any tie on or anything then all of a sudden something very spooky started happening every time i came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb i had this feeling that id never get to the other side of the street i thought id just go down down down and nobodyd ever see me again boy did it scare me you cant imagine i started sweating like a bastardmy whole shirt and underwear and everything then i started doing something else every time id get to the end of a block id make believe i was talking to my brother allie id say to him allie dont let me disappear allie dont let me disappear allie dont let me disappear please allie and then when id reach the other side of the street without disappearing id thank him then it would start all over again as soon as i got to the next corner but i kept going and all i was sort of afraid to stop i thinki dont remember to tell you the truth i know i didnt stop till i was way up in the sixties past the zoo and all then i sat down on this bench i could hardly get my breath and i was still sweating like a bastard i sat there i guess for about an hour finally what i decided id do i decided id go away i decided id never go home again and id never go away to another school again i decided id just see old phoebe and sort of say good by to her and all and give her back her christmas dough and then id start hitchhiking my way out west what id do i figured id go down to the holland tunnel and bum a ride and then id bum another one and another one and another one and in a few days id be somewhere out west where it was very pretty and sunny and where nobodyd know me and id get a job i figured i could get a job at a filling station somewhere putting gas and oil in peoples cars i didnt care what kind of job it was though just so people didnt know me and i didnt know anybody i thought what id do was id pretend i was one of those deafmutes that way i wouldnt have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody if anybody wanted to tell me something theyd have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me theyd get bored as hell doing that after a while and then id be through with having conversations for the rest of my life everybodyd think i was just a poor deafmute bastard and theyd leave me alone theyd let me put gas and oil in their stupid cars and theyd pay me a salary and all for it and id build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough i made and live there for the rest of my life id build it right near the woods but not right in them because id want it to be sunny as hell all the time id cook all my own food and later on if i wanted to get married or something id meet this beautiful girl that was also a deafmute and wed get married shed come and live in my cabin with me and if she wanted to say anything to me shed have to write it on a goddam piece of paper like everybody else if we had any children wed hide them somewhere we could buy them a lot of books and teach them how to read and write by ourselves i got excited as hell thinking about it i really did i knew the part about pretending i was a deafmute was crazy but i liked thinking about it anyway but i really decided to go out west and all all i wanted to do first was say goodby to old phoebe so all of a sudden i ran like a madman across the streeti damn near got killed doing it if you want to know the truthand went in this stationery store and bought a pad and pencil i figured id write her a note telling her where to meet me so i could say goodby to her and give her back her christmas dough and then id take the note up to her school and get somebody in the principals office to give it to her but i just put the pad and pencil in my pocket and started walking fast as hell up to her schooli was too excited to write the note right in the stationery store i walked fast because i wanted her to get the note before she went home for lunch and i didnt have any too much time i knew where her school was naturally because i went there myself when i was a kid when i got there it felt funny i wasnt sure id remember what it was like inside but i did it was exactly the same as it was when i went there they had that same big yard inside that was always sort of dark with those cages around the light bulbs so they wouldnt break if they got hit with a ball they had those same white circles painted all over the floor for games and stuff and those same old basketball rings without any netsjust the backboards and the rings nobody was around at all probably because it wasnt recess period and it wasnt lunchtime yet all i saw was one little kid a colored kid on his way to the bathroom he had one of those wooden passes sticking out of his hip pocket the same way we used to have to show he had permission and all to go to the bathroom i was still sweating but not so bad any more i went over to the stairs and sat down on the first step and took out the pad and pencil id bought the stairs had the same smell they used to have when i went there like somebodyd just taken a leak on them school stairs always smell like that anyway i sat there and wrote this note dear phoebe i cant wait around till wednesday any more so i will probably hitch hike out west this afternoon meet me at the museum of art near the door at quarter past if you can and i will give you your christmas dough back i didnt spend much l o v e h o l d e n her school was practically right near the museum and she had to pass it on her way home for lunch anyway so i knew she could meet me all right then i started walking up the stairs to the principals office so i could give the note to somebody that would bring it to her in her classroom i folded it about ten times so nobodyd open it you cant trust anybody in a goddam school but i knew theyd give it to her if i was her brother and all while i was walking up the stairs though all of a sudden i thought i was going to puke again only i didnt i sat down for a second and then i felt better but while i was sitting down i saw something that drove me crazy somebodyd written fuck you on the wall it drove me damn near crazy i thought how phoebe and all the other little kids would see it and how theyd wonder what the hell it meant and then finally some dirty kid would tell themall cockeyed naturallywhat it meant and how theyd all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days i kept wanting to kill whoeverd written it i figured it was some perverty bum thatd sneaked in the school late at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall i kept picturing myself catching him at it and how id smash his head on the stone steps till he was good and goddam dead and bloody but i knew too i wouldnt have the guts to do it i knew that that made me even more depressed i hardly even had the guts to rub it off the wall with my hand if you want to know the truth i was afraid some teacher would catch me rubbing it off and would think id written it but i rubbed it out anyway finally then i went on up to the principals office the principal didnt seem to be around but some old lady around a hundred years old was sitting at a typewriter i told her i was phoebe caulfields brother in b and i asked her to please give phoebe the note i said it was very important because my mother was sick and wouldnt have lunch ready for phoebe and that shed have to meet me and have lunch in a drugstore she was very nice about it the old lady she took the note off me and called some other lady from the next office and the other lady went to give it to phoebe then the old lady that was around a hundred years old and i shot the breeze for a while she was pretty nice and i told her how id gone there to school too and my brothers she asked me where i went to school now and i told her pencey and she said pencey was a very good school even if id wanted to i wouldnt have had the strength to straighten her out besides if she thought pencey was a very good school let her think it you hate to tell new stuff to somebody around a hundred years old they dont like to hear it then after a while i left it was funny she yelled good luck at me the same way old spencer did when i left pencey god how i hate it when somebody yells good luck at me when im leaving somewhere its depressing i went down by a different staircase and i saw another fuck you on the wall i tried to rub it off with my hand again but this one was scratched on with a knife or something it wouldnt come off its hopeless anyway if you had a million years to do it in you couldnt rub out even half the fuck you signs in the world its impossible i looked at the clock in the recess yard and it was only twenty to twelve so i had quite a lot of time to kill before i met old phoebe but i just walked over to the museum anyway there wasnt anyplace else to go i thought maybe i might stop in a phone booth and give old jane gallagher a buzz before i started bumming my way west but i wasnt in the mood for one thing i wasnt even sure she was home for vacation yet so i just went over to the museum and hung around while i was waiting around for phoebe in the museum right inside the doors and all these two little kids came up to me and asked me if i knew where the mummies were the one little kid the one that asked me had his pants open i told him about it so he buttoned them up right where he was standing talking to mehe didnt even bother to go behind a post or anything he killed me i wouldve laughed but i was afraid id feel like vomiting again so i didnt wherere the mummies fella the kid said again ya know i horsed around with the two of them a little bit the mummies whatre they i asked the one kid you know the mummiesthem dead guys that get buried in them toons and all toons that killed me he meant tombs how come you two guys arent in school i said no school tday the kid that did all the talking said he was lying sure as im alive the little bastard i didnt have anything to do though till old phoebe showed up so i helped them find the place where the mummies were boy i used to know exactly where they were but i hadnt been in that museum in years you two guys so interested in mummies i said yeah cant your friend talk i said he aint my friend hes my brudda cant he talk i looked at the one that wasnt doing any talking cant you talk at all i asked him yeah he said i dont feel like it finally we found the place where the mummies were and we went in you know how the egyptians buried their dead i asked the one kid naa well you should its very interesting they wrapped their faces up in these cloths that were treated with some secret chemical that way they could be buried in their tombs for thousands of years and their faces wouldnt rot or anything nobody knows how to do it except the egyptians even modern science to get to where the mummies were you had to go down this very narrow sort of hall with stones on the side that theyd taken right out of this pharaohs tomb and all it was pretty spooky and you could tell the two hotshots i was with werent enjoying it too much they stuck close as hell to me and the one that didnt talk at all practically was holding onto my sleeve lets go he said to his brother i seen em awreddy cmon hey he turned around and beat it hes got a yella streak a mile wide the other one said so long he beat it too i was the only one left in the tomb then i sort of liked it in a way it was so nice and peaceful then all of a sudden youd never guess what i saw on the wall another fuck you it was written with a red crayon or something right under the glass part of the wall under the stones thats the whole trouble you cant ever find a place thats nice and peaceful because there isnt any you may think there is but once you get there when youre not looking somebodyll sneak up and write fuck you right under your nose try it sometime i think even if i ever die and they stick me in a cemetery and i have a tombstone and all itll say holden caulfield on it and then what year i was born and what year i died and then right under that itll say fuck you im positive in fact after i came out of the place where the mummies were i had to go to the bathroom i sort of had diarrhea if you want to know the truth i didnt mind the diarrhea part too much but something else happened when i was coming out of the can right before i got to the door i sort of passed out i was lucky though i mean i couldve killed myself when i hit the floor but all i did was sort of land on my side it was a funny thing though i felt better after i passed out i really did my arm sort of hurt from where i fell but i didnt feel so damn dizzy any more it was about ten after twelve or so then and so i went back and stood by the door and waited for old phoebe i thought how it might be the last time id ever see her again any of my relatives i mean i figured id probably see them again but not for years i might come home when i was about thirtyfive i figured in case somebody got sick and wanted to see me before they died but that would be the only reason id leave my cabin and come back i even started picturing how it would be when i came back i knew my motherd get nervous as hell and start to cry and beg me to stay home and not go back to my cabin but id go anyway id be casual as hell id make her calm down and then id go over to the other side of the living room and take out this cigarette case and light a cigarette cool as all hell id ask them all to visit me sometime if they wanted to but i wouldnt insist or anything what id do id let old phoebe come out and visit me in the summertime and on christmas vacation and easter vacation and id let db come out and visit me for a while if he wanted a nice quiet place for his writing but he couldnt write any movies in my cabin only stories and books id have this rule that nobody could do anything phony when they visited me if anybody tried to do anything phony they couldnt stay all of a sudden i looked at the clock in the checkroom and it was twentyfive of one i began to get scared that maybe that old lady in the school had told that other lady not to give old phoebe my message i began to get scared that maybe shed told her to burn it or something it really scared hell out of me i really wanted to see old phoebe before i hit the road i mean i had her christmas dough and all finally i saw her i saw her through the glass part of the door the reason i saw her she had my crazy hunting hat onyou could see that hat about ten miles away i went out the doors and started down these stone stairs to meet her the thing i couldnt understand she had this big suitcase with her she was just coming across fifth avenue and she was dragging this goddam big suitcase with her she could hardly drag it when i got up closer i saw it was my old suitcase the one i used to use when i was at whooton i couldnt figure out what the hell she was doing with it hi she said when she got up close she was all out of breath from that crazy suitcase i thought maybe you werent coming i said what the hells in that bag i dont need anything im just going the way i am im not even taking the bags i got at the station what the hellya got in there she put the suitcase down my clothes she said im going with you can i okay what i said i almost fell over when she said that i swear to god i did i got sort of dizzy and i thought i was going to pass out or something again i took them down the back elevator so charlene wouldnt see me it isnt heavy all i have in it is two dresses and my moccasins and my underwear and socks and some other things feel it it isnt heavy feel it once cant i go with you holden cant i please no shut up i thought i was going to pass out cold i mean i didnt mean to tell her to shut up and all but i thought i was going to pass out again why cant i please holden i wont do anything ill just go with you thats all i wont even take my clothes with me if you dont want me toill just take my you cant take anything because youre not going im going alone so shut up please holden please let me go ill be very very veryyou wont even youre not going now shut up gimme that bag i said i took the bag off her i was almost all set to hit her i thought i was going to smack her for a second i really did she started to cry i thought you were supposed to be in a play at school and all i thought you were supposed to be benedict arnold in that play and all i said i said it very nasty whuddaya want to do not be in the play for gods sake that made her cry even harder i was glad all of a sudden i wanted her to cry till her eyes practically dropped out i almost hated her i think i hated her most because she wouldnt be in that play any more if she went away with me come on i said i started up the steps to the museum again i figured what id do was id check the crazy suitcase shed brought in the checkroom andy then she could get it again at three oclock after school i knew she couldnt take it back to school with her come on now i said she didnt go up the steps with me though she wouldnt come with me i went up anyway though and brought the bag in the checkroom and checked it and then i came down again she was still standing there on the sidewalk but she turned her back on me when i came up to her she can do that she can turn her back on you when she feels like it im not going away anywhere i changed my mind so stop crying and shut up i said the funny part was she wasnt even crying when i said that i said it anyway though cmon now ill walk you back to school cmon now youll be late she wouldnt answer me or anything i sort of tried to get hold of her old hand but she wouldnt let me she kept turning around on me didja have your lunch ya had your lunch yet i asked her she wouldnt answer me all she did was she took off my red hunting hatthe one i gave herand practically chucked it right in my face then she turned her back on me again it nearly killed me but i didnt say anything i just picked it up and stuck it in my coat pocket come on hey ill walk you back to school i said im not going back to school i didnt know what to say when she said that i just stood there for a couple of minutes you have to go back to school you want to be in that play dont you you want to be benedict arnold dont you no sure you do certainly you do cmon now lets go i said in the first place im not going away anywhere i told you im going home im going home as soon as you go back to school first im gonna go down to the station and get my bags and then im gonna go straight i said im not going back to school you can do what you want to do but im not going back to chool she said so shut up it was the first time she ever told me to shut up it sounded terrible god it sounded terrible it sounded worse than swearing she still wouldnt look at me either and every time i sort of put my hand on her shoulder or something she wouldnt let me listen do you want to go for a walk i asked her do you want to take a walk down to the zoo if i let you not go back to school this afternoon and go for walk will you cut out this crazy stuff she wouldnt answer me so i said it over again if i let you skip school this afternoon and go for a little walk will you cut out the crazy stuff will you go back to school tomorrow like a good girl i may and i may not she said then she ran right the hell across the street without even looking to see if any cars were coming shes a madman sometimes i didnt follow her though i knew shed follow me so i started walking downtown toward the zoo on the park side of the street and she started walking downtown on the other goddam side of the street she wouldnt look over at me at all but i could tell she was probably watching me out of the corner of her crazy eye to see where i was going and all anyway we kept walking that way all the way to the zoo the only thing that bothered me was when a doubledecker bus came along because then i couldnt see across the street and i couldnt see where the hell she was but when we got to the zoo i yelled over to her phoebe im going in the zoo cmon now she wouldnt look at me but i could tell she heard me and when i started down the steps to the zoo i turned around and saw she was crossing the street and following me and all there werent too many people in the zoo because it was sort of a lousy day but there were a few around the sea lions swimming pool and all i started to go by but old phoebe stopped and made out she was watching the sea lions getting feda guy was throwing fish at themso i went back i figured it was a good chance to catch up with her and all i went up and sort of stood behind her and sort of put my hands on her shoulders but she bent her knees and slid out from meshe can certainly be very snotty when she wants to she kept standing there while the sea lions were getting fed and i stood right behind her i didnt put my hands on her shoulders again or anything because if i had she really wouldve beat it on me kids are funny you have to watch what youre doing she wouldnt walk right next to me when we left the sea lions but she didnt walk too far away she sort of walked on one side of the sidewalk and i walked on the other side it wasnt too gorgeous but it was better than having her walk about a mile away from me like before we went up and watched the bears on that little hill for a while but there wasnt much to watch only one of the bears was out the polar bear the other one the brown one was in his goddam cave and wouldnt come out all you could see was his rear end there was a little kid standing next to me with a cowboy hat on practically over his ears and he kept telling his father make him come out daddy make him come out i looked at old phoebe but she wouldnt laugh you know kids when theyre sore at you they wont laugh or anything after we left the bears we left the zoo and crossed over this little street in the park and then we went through one of those little tunnels that always smell from somebodys taking a leak it was on the way to the carrousel old phoebe still wouldnt talk to me or anything but she was sort of walking next to me now i took a hold of the belt at the back of her coat just for the hell of it but she wouldnt let me she said keep your hands to yourself if you dont mind she was still sore at me but not as sore as she was before anyway we kept getting closer and closer to the carrousel and you could start to hear that nutty music it always plays it was playing oh marie it played that same song about fifty years ago when i was a little kid thats one nice thing about carrousels they always play the same songs i thought the carrousel was closed in the wintertime old phoebe said it was the first time she practically said anything she probably forgot she was supposed to be sore at me maybe because its around christmas i said she didnt say anything when i said that she probably remembered she was supposed to be sore at me do you want to go for a ride on it i said i knew she probably did when she was a tiny little kid and allie and db and i used to go to the park with her she was mad about the carrousel you couldnt get her off the goddam thing im too big she said i thought she wasnt going to answer me but she did no youre not go on ill wait for ya go on i said we were right there then there were a few kids riding on it mostly very little kids and a few parents were waiting around outside sitting on the benches and all what i did was i went up to the window where they sell the tickets and bought old phoebe a ticket then i gave it to her she was standing right next to me here i said wait a secondtake the rest of your dough too i started giving her the rest of the dough shed lent me you keep it keep it for me she said then she said right afterwardplease thats depressing when somebody says please to you i mean if its phoebe or somebody that depressed the hell out of me but i put the dough back in my pocket arent you gonna ride too she asked me she was looking at me sort of funny you could tell she wasnt too sore at me any more maybe i will the next time ill watch ya i said got your ticket yes go ahead thenill be on this bench right over here ill watch ya i went over and sat down on this bench and she went and got on the carrousel she walked all around it i mean she walked once all the way around it then she sat down on this big brown beatuplooking old horse then the carrousel started and i watched her go around and around there were only about five or six other kids on the ride and the song the carrousel was playing was smoke gets in y our eyes it was playing it very jazzy and funny all the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring and so was old phoebe and i was sort of afraid shed fall off the goddam horse but i didnt say anything or do anything the thing with kids is if they want to grab the gold ring you have to let them do it and not say anything if they fall off they fall off but its bad if you say anything to them when the ride was over she got off her horse and came over to me you ride once too this time she said no ill just watch ya i think ill just watch i said i gave her some more of her dough here get some more tickets she took the dough off me im not mad at you any more she said i know hurry upthe things gonna start again then all of a sudden she gave me a kiss then she held her hand out and said its raining its starting to rain i know then what she didit damn near killed meshe reached in my coat pocket and took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head dont you want it i said you can wear it a while okay hurry up though now youre gonna miss your ride you wont get your own horse or anything she kept hanging around though did you mean it what you said you really arent going away anywhere are you really going home afterwards she asked me yeah i said i meant it too i wasnt lying to her i really did go home afterwards hurry up now i said the things starting she ran and bought her ticket and got back on the goddam carrousel just in time then she walked all the way around it till she got her own horse back then she got on it she waved to me and i waved back boy it began to rain like a bastard in buckets i swear to god all the parents and mothers and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel so they wouldnt get soaked to the skin or anything but i stuck around on the bench for quite a while i got pretty soaking wet especially my neck and my pants my hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection in a way but i got soaked anyway i didnt care though i felt so damn happy all of sudden the way old phoebe kept going around and around i was damn near bawling i felt so damn happy if you want to know the truth i dont know why it was just that she looked so damn nice the way she kept going around
