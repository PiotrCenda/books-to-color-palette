the dark forest the hill of difficulty the panther the lion and the wolf virgil midway upon the journey of our life i found myself within a forest dark for the straightforward pathway had been lost ah me how hard a thing it is to say what was this forest savage rough and stern which in the very thought renews the fear so bitter is it death is little more but of the good to treat which there i found speak will i of the other things i saw there i cannot well repeat how there i entered so full was i of slumber at the moment in which i had abandoned the true way but after i had reached a mountains foot at that point where the valley terminated which had with consternation pierced my heart upward i looked and i beheld its shoulders vested already with that planets rays which leadeth others right by every road then was the fear a little quieted that in my hearts lake had endured throughout the night which i had passed so piteously and even as he who with distressful breath forth issued from the sea upon the shore turns to the water perilous and gazes so did my soul that still was fleeing onward turn itself back to rebehold the pass which never yet a living person left after my weary body i had rested the way resumed i on the desert slope so that the firm foot ever was the lower and lo almost where the ascent began a panther light and swift exceedingly which with a spotted skin was covered oer and never moved she from before my face nay rather did impede so much my way that many times i to return had turned the time was the beginning of the morning and up the sun was mounting with those stars that with him were what time the love divine at first in motion set those beauteous things so were to me occasion of good hope the variegated skin of that wild beast the hour of time and the delicious season but not so much that did not give me fear a lions aspect which appeared to me he seemed as if against me he were coming with head uplifted and with ravenous hunger so that it seemed the air was afraid of him and a shewolf that with all hungerings seemed to be laden in her meagreness and many folk has caused to live forlorn she brought upon me so much heaviness with the affright that from her aspect came that i the hope relinquished of the height and as he is who willingly acquires and the time comes that causes him to lose who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent een such made me that beast withouten peace which coming on against me by degrees thrust me back thither where the sun is silent while i was rushing downward to the lowland before mine eyes did one present himself who seemed from longcontinued silence hoarse when i beheld him in the desert vast have pity on me unto him i cried whicheer thou art or shade or real man he answered me not man man once i was and both my parents were of lombardy and mantuans by country both of them sub julio was i born though it was late and lived at rome under the good augustus during the time of false and lying gods a poet was i and i sang that just son of anchises who came forth from troy after that ilion the superb was burned but thou why goest thou back to such annoyance why climbst thou not the mount delectable which is the source and cause of every joy now art thou that virgilius and that fountain which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech i made response to him with bashful forehead o of the other poets honour and light avail me the long study and great love that have impelled me to explore thy volume thou art my master and my author thou thou art alone the one from whom i took the beautiful style that has done honour to me behold the beast for which i have turned back do thou protect me from her famous sage for she doth make my veins and pulses tremble thee it behoves to take another road responded he when he beheld me weeping if from this savage place thou wouldst escape because this beast at which thou criest out suffers not any one to pass her way but so doth harass him that she destroys him and has a nature so malign and ruthless that never doth she glut her greedy will and after food is hungrier than before many the animals with whom she weds and more they shall be still until the greyhound comes who shall make her perish in her pain he shall not feed on either earth or pelf but upon wisdom and on love and virtue twixt feltro and feltro shall his nation be of that low italy shall he be the saviour on whose account the maid camilla died euryalus turnus nisus of their wounds through every city shall he hunt her down until he shall have driven her back to hell there from whence envy first did let her loose therefore i think and judge it for thy best thou follow me and i will be thy guide and lead thee hence through the eternal place where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate who cry out each one for the second death and thou shalt see those who contented are within the fire because they hope to come wheneer it may be to the blessed people to whom then if thou wishest to ascend a soul shall be for that than i more worthy with her at my departure i will leave thee because that emperor who reigns above in that i was rebellious to his law wills that through me none come into his city he governs everywhere and there he reigns there is his city and his lofty throne o happy he whom thereto he elects and i to him poet i thee entreat by that same god whom thou didst never know so that i may escape this woe and worse thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said that i may see the portal of saint peter and those thou makest so disconsolate then he moved on and i behind him followed chapter the descent dantes protest and virgils appeal the intercession of the three ladies benedight day was departing and the embrowned air released the animals that are on earth from their fatigues and i the only one made myself ready to sustain the war both of the way and likewise of the woe which memory that errs not shall retrace o muses o high genius now assist me o memory that didst write down what i saw here thy nobility shall be manifest and i began poet who guidest me regard my manhood if it be sufficient ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me thou sayest that of silvius the parent while yet corruptible unto the world immortal went and was there bodily but if the adversary of all evil was courteous thinking of the high effect that issue would from him and who and what to men of intellect unmeet it seems not for he was of great rome and of her empire in the empyreal heaven as father chosen the which and what wishing to speak the truth were stablished as the holy place wherein sits the successor of the greatest peter upon this journey whence thou givest him vaunt things did he hear which the occasion were both of his victory and the papal mantle thither went afterwards the chosen vessel to bring back comfort thence unto that faith which of salvations way is the beginning but i why thither come or who concedes it i not aeneas am i am not paul nor i nor others think me worthy of it therefore if i resign myself to come i fear the coming may be illadvised thourt wise and knowest better than i speak and as he is who unwills what he willed and by new thoughts doth his intention change so that from his design he quite withdraws such i became upon that dark hillside because in thinking i consumed the emprise which was so very prompt in the beginning if i have well thy language understood replied that shade of the magnanimous thy soul attainted is with cowardice which many times a man encumbers so it turns him back from honoured enterprise as false sight doth a beast when he is shy that thou mayst free thee from this apprehension ill tell thee why i came and what i heard at the first moment when i grieved for thee among those was i who are in suspense and a fair saintly lady called to me in such wise i besought her to command me her eyes where shining brighter than the star and she began to say gentle and low with voice angelical in her own language o spirit courteous of mantua of whom the fame still in the world endures and shall endure longlasting as the world a friend of mine and not the friend of fortune upon the desert slope is so impeded upon his way that he has turned through terror and may i fear already be so lost that i too late have risen to his succour from that which i have heard of him in heaven bestir thee now and with thy speech ornate and with what needful is for his release assist him so that i may be consoled beatrice am i who do bid thee go i come from there where i would fain return love moved me which compelleth me to speak when i shall be in presence of my lord full often will i praise thee unto him then paused she and thereafter i began o lady of virtue thou alone through whom the human race exceedeth all contained within the heaven that has the lesser circles so grateful unto me is thy commandment to obey if twere already done were late no farther needst thou ope to me thy wish but the cause tell me why thou dost not shun the here descending down into this centre from the vast place thou burnest to return to since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern briefly will i relate she answered me why i am not afraid to enter here of those things only should one be afraid which have the power of doing others harm of the rest no because they are not fearful god in his mercy such created me that misery of yours attains me not nor any flame assails me of this burning a gentle lady is in heaven who grieves at this impediment to which i send thee so that stern judgment there above is broken in her entreaty she besought lucia and said thy faithful one now stands in need of thee and unto thee i recommend him lucia foe of all that cruel is hastened away and came unto the place where i was sitting with the ancient rachel beatrice said she the true praise of god why succourest thou not him who loved thee so for thee he issued from the vulgar herd dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint dost thou not see the death that combats him beside that flood where ocean has no vaunt never were persons in the world so swift to work their weal and to escape their woe as i after such words as these were uttered came hither downward from my blessed seat confiding in thy dignified discourse which honours thee and those whove listened to it after she thus had spoken unto me weeping her shining eyes she turned away whereby she made me swifter in my coming and unto thee i came as she desired i have delivered thee from that wild beast which barred the beautiful mountains short ascent what is it then why why dost thou delay why is such baseness bedded in thy heart daring and hardihood why hast thou not seeing that three such ladies benedight are caring for thee in the court of heaven and so much good my speech doth promise thee even as the flowerets by nocturnal chill bowed down and closed when the sun whitens them uplift themselves all open on their stems such i became with my exhausted strength and such good courage to my heart there coursed that i began like an intrepid person o she compassionate who succoured me and courteous thou who hast obeyed so soon the words of truth which she addressed to thee thou hast my heart so with desire disposed to the adventure with these words of thine that to my first intent i have returned now go for one sole will is in us both thou leader and thou lord and master thou thus said i to him and when he had moved i entered on the deep and savage way chapter the gate of hell the inefficient or indifferent pope celestine v the shores of acheron charon the earthquake and the swoon through me the way is to the city dolent through me the way is to eternal dole through me the way among the people lost justice incited my sublime creator created me divine omnipotence the highest wisdom and the primal love before me there were no created things only eterne and i eternal last all hope abandon ye who enter in these words in sombre colour i beheld written upon the summit of a gate whence i their sense is master hard to me and he to me as one experienced here all suspicion needs must be abandoned all cowardice must needs be here extinct we to the place have come where i have told thee thou shalt behold the people dolorous who have foregone the good of intellect and after he had laid his hand on mine with joyful mien whence i was comforted he led me in among the secret things there sighs complaints and ululations loud resounded through the air without a star whence i at the beginning wept thereat languages diverse horrible dialects accents of anger words of agony and voices high and hoarse with sound of hands made up a tumult that goes whirling on for ever in that air for ever black even as the sand doth when the whirlwind breathes and i who had my head with horror bound said master what is this which now i hear what folk is this which seems by pain so vanquished and he to me this miserable mode maintain the melancholy souls of those who lived withouten infamy or praise commingled are they with that caitiff choir of angels who have not rebellious been nor faithful were to god but were for self the heavens expelled them not to be less fair nor them the nethermore abyss receives for glory none the damned would have from them and i o master what so grievous is to these that maketh them lament so sore he answered i will tell thee very briefly these have no longer any hope of death and this blind life of theirs is so debased they envious are of every other fate no fame of them the world permits to be misericord and justice both disdain them let us not speak of them but look and pass and i who looked again beheld a banner which whirling round ran on so rapidly that of all pause it seemed to me indignant and after it there came so long a train of people that i neer would have believed that ever death so many had undone when some among them i had recognised i looked and i beheld the shade of him who made through cowardice the great refusal forthwith i comprehended and was certain that this the sect was of the caitiff wretches hateful to god and to his enemies these miscreants who never were alive were naked and were stung exceedingly by gadflies and by hornets that were there these did their faces irrigate with blood which with their tears commingled at their feet by the disgusting worms was gathered up and when to gazing farther i betook me people i saw on a great rivers bank whence said i master now vouchsafe to me that i may know who these are and what law makes them appear so ready to pass over as i discern athwart the dusky light and he to me these things shall all be known to thee as soon as we our footsteps stay upon the dismal shore of acheron then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast fearing my words might irksome be to him from speech refrained i till we reached the river and lo towards us coming in a boat an old man hoary with the hair of eld crying woe unto you ye souls depraved hope nevermore to look upon the heavens i come to lead you to the other shore to the eternal shades in heat and frost and thou that yonder standest living soul withdraw thee from these people who are dead but when he saw that i did not withdraw he said by other ways by other ports thou to the shore shalt come not here for passage a lighter vessel needs must carry thee and unto him the guide vex thee not charon it is so willed there where is power to do that which is willed and farther question not thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks of him the ferryman of the livid fen who round about his eyes had wheels of flame but all those souls who weary were and naked their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together as soon as they had heard those cruel words god they blasphemed and their progenitors the human race the place the time the seed of their engendering and of their birth thereafter all together they drew back bitterly weeping to the accursed shore which waiteth every man who fears not god charon the demon with the eyes of glede beckoning to them collects them all together beats with his oar whoever lags behind as in the autumntime the leaves fall off first one and then another till the branch unto the earth surrenders all its spoils in similar wise the evil seed of adam throw themselves from that margin one by one at signals as a bird unto its lure so they depart across the dusky wave and ere upon the other side they land again on this side a new troop assembles my son the courteous master said to me all those who perish in the wrath of god here meet together out of every land and ready are they to pass oer the river because celestial justice spurs them on so that their fear is turned into desire this way there never passes a good soul and hence if charon doth complain of thee well mayst thou know now what his speech imports this being finished all the dusk champaign trembled so violently that of that terror the recollection bathes me still with sweat the land of tears gave forth a blast of wind and fulminated a vermilion light which overmastered in me every sense and as a man whom sleep hath seized i fell chapter the first circle limbo virtuous pagans and the un baptized the four poets homer horace ovid and lucan the noble castle of philosophy broke the deep lethargy within my head a heavy thunder so that i upstarted like to a person who by force is wakened and round about i moved my rested eyes uprisen erect and steadfastly i gazed to recognise the place wherein i was true is it that upon the verge i found me of the abysmal valley dolorous that gathers thunder of infinite ululations obscure profound it was and nebulous so that by fixing on its depths my sight nothing whatever i discerned therein let us descend now into the blind world began the poet pallid utterly i will be first and thou shalt second be and i who of his colour was aware said how shall i come if thou art afraid whort wont to be a comfort to my fears and he to me the anguish of the people who are below here in my face depicts that pity which for terror thou hast taken let us go on for the long way impels us thus he went in and thus he made me enter the foremost circle that surrounds the abyss there as it seemed to me from listening were lamentations none but only sighs that tremble made the everlasting air and this arose from sorrow without torment which the crowds had that many were and great of infants and of women and of men to me the master good thou dost not ask what spirits these which thou beholdest are now will i have thee know ere thou go farther that they sinned not and if they merit had tis not enough because they had not baptism which is the portal of the faith thou holdest and if they were before christianity in the right manner they adored not god and among such as these am i myself for such defects and not for other guilt lost are we and are only so far punished that without hope we live on in desire great grief seized on my heart when this i heard because some people of much worthiness i knew who in that limbo were suspended tell me my master tell me thou my lord began i with desire of being certain of that faith which oercometh every error came any one by his own merit hence or by anothers who was blessed thereafter and he who understood my covert speech replied i was a novice in this state when i saw hither come a mighty one with sign of victory incoronate hence he drew forth the shade of the first parent and that of his son abel and of noah of moses the lawgiver and the obedient abraham patriarch and david king israel with his father and his children and rachel for whose sake he did so much and others many and he made them blessed and thou must know that earlier than these never were any human spirits saved we ceased not to advance because he spake but still were passing onward through the forest the forest say i of thickcrowded ghosts not very far as yet our way had gone this side the summit when i saw a fire that overcame a hemisphere of darkness we were a little distant from it still but not so far that i in part discerned not that honourable people held that place o thou who honourest every art and science who may these be which such great honour have that from the fashion of the rest it parts them and he to me the honourable name that sounds of them above there in thy life wins grace in heaven that so advances them in the mean time a voice was heard by me all honour be to the preeminent poet his shade returns again that was departed after the voice had ceased and quiet was four mighty shades i saw approaching us semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad to say to me began my gracious master him with that falchion in his hand behold who comes before the three even as their lord that one is homer poet sovereign he who comes next is horace the satirist the third is ovid and the last is lucan because to each of these with me applies the name that solitary voice proclaimed they do me honour and in that do well thus i beheld assemble the fair school of that lord of the song preeminent who oer the others like an eagle soars when they together had discoursed somewhat they turned to me with signs of salutation and on beholding this my master smiled and more of honour still much more they did me in that they made me one of their own band so that the sixth was i mid so much wit thus we went on as far as to the light things saying tis becoming to keep silent as was the saying of them where i was we came unto a noble castles foot seven times encompassed with lofty walls defended round by a fair rivulet this we passed over even as firm ground through portals seven i entered with these sages we came into a meadow of fresh verdure people were there with solemn eyes and slow of great authority in their countenance they spake but seldom and with gentle voices thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side into an opening luminous and lofty so that they all of them were visible there opposite upon the green enamel were pointed out to me the mighty spirits whom to have seen i feel myself exalted i saw electra with companions many mongst whom i knew both hector and aeneas caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes i saw camilla and penthesilea on the other side and saw the king latinus who with lavinia his daughter sat i saw that brutus who drove tarquin forth lucretia julia marcia and cornelia and saw alone apart the saladin when i had lifted up my brows a little the master i beheld of those who know sit with his philosophic family all gaze upon him and all do him honour there i beheld both socrates and plato who nearer him before the others stand democritus who puts the world on chance diogenes anaxagoras and thales zeno empedocles and heraclitus of qualities i saw the good collector hight dioscorides and orpheus saw i tully and livy and moral seneca euclid geometrician and ptolemy galen hippocrates and avicenna averroes who the great comment made i cannot all of them pourtray in full because so drives me onward the long theme that many times the word comes short of fact the sixfold company in two divides another way my sapient guide conducts me forth from the quiet to the air that trembles and to a place i come where nothing shines chapter the second circle the wanton minos the infernal hurricane francesca da rimini thus i descended out of the first circle down to the second that less space begirds and so much greater dole that goads to wailing there standeth minos horribly and snarls examines the transgressions at the entrance judges and sends according as he girds him i say that when the spirit evilborn cometh before him wholly it confesses and this discriminator of transgressions seeth what place in hell is meet for it girds himself with his tail as many times as grades he wishes it should be thrust down always before him many of them stand they go by turns each one unto the judgment they speak and hear and then are downward hurled o thou that to this dolorous hostelry comest said minos to me when he saw me leaving the practice of so great an office look how thou enterest and in whom thou trustest let not the portals amplitude deceive thee and unto him my guide why criest thou too do not impede his journey fateordained it is so willed there where is power to do that which is willed and ask no further question and now begin the dolesome notes to grow audible unto me now am i come there where much lamentation strikes upon me i came into a place mute of all light which bellows as the sea does in a tempest if by opposing winds t is combated the infernal hurricane that never rests hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine whirling them round and smiting it molests them when they arrive before the precipice there are the shrieks the plaints and the laments there they blaspheme the puissance divine i understood that unto such a torment the carnal malefactors were condemned who reason subjugate to appetite and as the wings of starlings bear them on in the cold season in large band and full so doth that blast the spirits maledict it hither thither downward upward drives them no hope doth comfort them for evermore not of repose but even of lesser pain and as the cranes go chanting forth their lays making in air a long line of themselves so saw i coming uttering lamentations shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress whereupon said i master who are those people whom the black air so castigates the first of those of whom intelligence thou fain wouldst have then said he unto me the empress was of many languages to sensual vices she was so abandoned that lustful she made licit in her law to remove the blame to which she had been led she is semiramis of whom we read that she succeeded ninus and was his spouse she held the land which now the sultan rules the next is she who killed herself for love and broke faith with the ashes of sichaeus then cleopatra the voluptuous helen i saw for whom so many ruthless seasons revolved and saw the great achilles who at the last hour combated with love paris i saw tristan and more than a thousand shades did he name and point out with his finger whom love had separated from our life after that i had listened to my teacher naming the dames of eld and cavaliers pity prevailed and i was nigh bewildered and i began o poet willingly speak would i to those two who go together and seem upon the wind to be so light and he to me thoult mark when they shall be nearer to us and then do thou implore them by love which leadeth them and they will come soon as the wind in our direction sways them my voice uplift i o ye weary souls come speak to us if no one interdicts it as turtledoves called onward by desire with open and steady wings to the sweet nest fly through the air by their volition borne so came they from the band where dido is approaching us athwart the air malign so strong was the affectionate appeal o living creature gracious and benignant who visiting goest through the purple air us who have stained the world incarnadine if were the king of the universe our friend we would pray unto him to give thee peace since thou hast pity on our woe perverse of what it pleases thee to hear and speak that will we hear and we will speak to you while silent is the wind as it is now sitteth the city wherein i was born upon the seashore where the po descends to rest in peace with all his retinue love that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize seized this man for the person beautiful that was taen from me and still the mode offends me love that exempts no one beloved from loving seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly that as thou seest it doth not yet desert me love has conducted us unto one death caina waiteth him who quenched our life these words were borne along from them to us as soon as i had heard those souls tormented i bowed my face and so long held it down until the poet said to me what thinkest when i made answer i began alas how many pleasant thoughts how much desire conducted these unto the dolorous pass then unto them i turned me and i spake and i began thine agonies francesca sad and compassionate to weeping make me but tell me at the time of those sweet sighs by what and in what manner love conceded that you should know your dubious desires and she to me there is no greater sorrow than to be mindful of the happy time in misery and that thy teacher knows but if to recognise the earliest root of love in us thou hast so great desire i will do even as he who weeps and speaks one day we reading were for our delight of launcelot how love did him enthral alone we were and without any fear full many a time our eyes together drew that reading and drove the colour from our faces but one point only was it that oercame us when as we read of the muchlongedfor smile being by such a noble lover kissed this one who neer from me shall be divided kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating galeotto was the book and he who wrote it that day no farther did we read therein and all the while one spirit uttered this the other one did weep so that for pity i swooned away as if i had been dying and fell even as a dead body falls chapter the third circle the gluttonous cerberus the eternal rain ciacco florence at the return of consciousness that closed before the pity of those two relations which utterly with sadness had confused me new torments i behold and new tormented around me whichsoever way i move and whichsoever way i turn and gaze in the third circle am i of the rain eternal maledict and cold and heavy its law and quality are never new huge hail and water sombrehued and snow athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain noisome the earth is that receiveth this cerberus monster cruel and uncouth with his three gullets like a dog is barking over the people that are there submerged red eyes he has and unctuous beard and black and belly large and armed with claws his hands he rends the spirits flays and quarters them howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs one side they make a shelter for the other oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates when cerberus perceived us the great worm his mouths he opened and displayed his tusks not a limb had he that was motionless and my conductor with his spans extended took of the earth and with his fists well filled he threw it into those rapacious gullets such as that dog is who by barking craves and quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws for to devour it he but thinks and struggles the like became those muzzles filthbegrimed of cerberus the demon who so thunders over the souls that they would fain be deaf we passed across the shadows which subdues the heavy rainstorm and we placed our feet upon their vanity that person seems they all were lying prone upon the earth excepting one who sat upright as soon as he beheld us passing on before him o thou that art conducted through this hell he said to me recall me if thou canst thyself wast made before i was unmade and i to him the anguish which thou hast perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance so that it seems not i have ever seen thee but tell me who thou art that in so doleful a place art put and in such punishment if some are greater none is so displeasing and he to me thy city which is full of envy so that now the sack runs over held me within it in the life serene you citizens were wont to call me ciacco for the pernicious sin of gluttony i as thou seest am battered by this rain and i sad soul am not the only one for all these suffer the like penalty for the like sin and word no more spake he i answered him ciacco thy wretchedness weighs on me so that it to weep invites me but tell me if thou knowest to what shall come the citizens of the divided city if any there be just and the occasion tell me why so much discord has assailed it and he to me they after long contention will come to bloodshed and the rustic party will drive the other out with much offence then afterwards behoves it this one fall within three suns and rise again the other by force of him who now is on the coast high will it hold its forehead a long while keeping the other under heavy burdens howeer it weeps thereat and is indignant the just are two and are not understood there envy and arrogance and avarice are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled here ended he his tearful utterance and i to him i wish thee still to teach me and make a gift to me of further speech farinata and tegghiaio once so worthy jacopo rusticucci arrigo and mosca and others who on good deeds set their thoughts say where they are and cause that i may know them for great desire constraineth me to learn if heaven doth sweeten them or hell envenom and he they are among the blacker souls a different sin downweighs them to the bottom if thou so far descendest thou canst see them but when thou art again in the sweet world i pray thee to the mind of others bring me no more i tell thee and no more i answer then his straightforward eyes he turned askance eyed me a little and then bowed his head he fell therewith prone like the other blind and the guide said to me he wakes no more this side the sound of the angelic trumpet when shall approach the hostile potentate each one shall find again his dismal tomb shall reassume his flesh and his own figure shall hear what through eternity reechoes so we passed onward oer the filthy mixture of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow touching a little on the future life wherefore i said master these torments here will they increase after the mighty sentence or lesser be or will they be as burning and he to me return unto thy science which wills that as the thing more perfect is the more it feels of pleasure and of pain albeit that this people maledict to true perfection never can attain hereafter more than now they look to be round in a circle by that road we went speaking much more which i do not repeat we came unto the point where the descent is there we found plutus the great enemy chapter the fourth circle the avaricious and the prodigal plutus fortune and her wheel the fifth circle the irascible and the sullen styx pape satan pape satan aleppe thus plutus with his clucking voice began and that benignant sage who all things knew said to encourage me let not thy fear harm thee for any power that he may have shall not prevent thy going down this crag then he turned round unto that bloated lip and said be silent thou accursed wolf consume within thyself with thine own rage not causeless is this journey to the abyss thus is it willed on high where michael wrought vengeance upon the proud adultery even as the sails inflated by the wind involved together fall when snaps the mast so fell the cruel monster to the earth thus we descended into the fourth chasm gaining still farther on the dolesome shore which all the woe of the universe insacks justice of god ah who heaps up so many new toils and sufferings as i beheld and why doth our transgression waste us so as doth the billow there upon charybdis that breaks itself on that which it encounters so here the folk must dance their roundelay here saw i people more than elsewhere many on one side and the other with great howls rolling weights forward by main force of chest they clashed together and then at that point each one turned backward rolling retrograde crying why keepest and why squanderest thou thus they returned along the lurid circle on either hand unto the opposite point shouting their shameful metre evermore then each when he arrived there wheeled about through his halfcircle to another joust and i who had my heart pierced as it were exclaimed my master now declare to me what people these are and if all were clerks these shaven crowns upon the left of us and he to me all of them were asquint in intellect in the first life so much that there with measure they no spending made clearly enough their voices bark it forth wheneer they reach the two points of the circle where sunders them the opposite defect clerks those were who no hairy covering have on the head and popes and cardinals in whom doth avarice practise its excess and i my master among such as these i ought forsooth to recognise some few who were infected with these maladies and he to me vain thought thou entertainest the undiscerning life which made them sordid now makes them unto all discernment dim forever shall they come to these two buttings these from the sepulchre shall rise again with the fist closed and these with tresses shorn ill giving and ill keeping the fair world have taen from them and placed them in this scuffle whateer it be no words adorn i for it now canst thou son behold the transient farce of goods that are committed unto fortune for which the human race each other buffet for all the gold that is beneath the moon or ever has been of these weary souls could never make a single one repose master i said to him now tell me also what is this fortune which thou speakest of that has the worlds goods so within its clutches and he to me o creatures imbecile what ignorance is this which doth beset you now will i have thee learn my judgment of her he whose omniscience everything transcends the heavens created and gave who should guide them that every part to every part may shine distributing the light in equal measure he in like manner to the mundane splendours ordained a general ministress and guide that she might change at times the empty treasures from race to race from one blood to another beyond resistance of all human wisdom therefore one people triumphs and another languishes in pursuance of her judgment which hidden is as in the grass a serpent your knowledge has no counterstand against her she makes provision judges and pursues her governance as theirs the other gods her permutations have not any truce necessity makes her precipitate so often cometh who his turn obtains and this is she who is so crucified even by those who ought to give her praise giving her blame amiss and bad repute but she is blissful and she hears it not among the other primal creatures gladsome she turns her sphere and blissful she rejoices let us descend now unto greater woe already sinks each star that was ascending when i set out and loitering is forbidden we crossed the circle to the other bank near to a fount that boils and pours itself along a gully that runs out of it the water was more sombre far than perse and we in company with the dusky waves made entrance downward by a path uncouth a marsh it makes which has the name of styx this tristful brooklet when it has descended down to the foot of the malign gray shores and i who stood intent upon beholding saw people mudbesprent in that lagoon all of them naked and with angry look they smote each other not alone with hands but with the head and with the breast and feet tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth said the good master son thou now beholdest the souls of those whom anger overcame and likewise i would have thee know for certain beneath the water people are who sigh and make this water bubble at the surface as the eye tells thee wheresoeer it turns fixed in the mire they say we sullen were in the sweet air which by the sun is gladdened bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek now we are sullen in this sable mire this hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats for with unbroken words they cannot say it thus we went circling round the filthy fen a great arc twixt the dry bank and the swamp with eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire unto the foot of a tower we came at last chapter phlegyas philippo argenti the gate of the city of dis i say continuing that long before we to the foot of that high tower had come our eyes went upward to the summit of it by reason of two flamelets we saw placed there and from afar another answer them so far that hardly could the eye attain it and to the sea of all discernment turned i said what sayeth this and what respondeth that other fire and who are they that made it and he to me across the turbid waves what is expected thou canst now discern if reek of the morass conceal it not cord never shot an arrow from itself that sped away athwart the air so swift as i beheld a very little boat come oer the water towrds us at that moment under the guidance of a single pilot who shouted now art thou arrived fell soul phlegyas phlegyas thou criest out in vain for this once said my lord thou shalt not have us longer than in the passing of the slough as he who listens to some great deceit that has been done to him and then resents it such became phlegyas in his gathered wrath my guide descended down into the boat and then he made me enter after him and only when i entered seemed it laden soon as the guide and i were in the boat the antique prow goes on its way dividing more of the water than tis wont with others while we were running through the dead canal uprose in front of me one full of mire and said who rt thou that comest ere the hour and i to him although i come i stay not but who art thou that hast become so squalid thou seest that i am one who weeps he answered and i to him with weeping and with wailing thou spirit maledict do thou remain for thee i know though thou art all defiled then stretched he both his hands unto the boat whereat my wary master thrust him back saying away there with the other dogs thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck he kissed my face and said disdainful soul blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom that was an arrogant person in the world goodness is none that decks his memory so likewise here his shade is furious how many are esteemed great kings up there who here shall be like unto swine in mire leaving behind them horrible dispraises and i my master much should i be pleased if i could see him soused into this broth before we issue forth out of the lake and he to me ere unto thee the shore reveal itself thou shalt be satisfied such a desire tis meet thou shouldst enjoy a little after that i saw such havoc made of him by the people of the mire that still i praise and thank my god for it they all were shouting at philippo argenti and that exasperate spirit florentine turned round upon himself with his own teeth we left him there and more of him i tell not but on mine ears there smote a lamentation whence forward i intent unbar mine eyes and the good master said even now my son the city draweth near whose name is dis with the grave citizens with the great throng and i its mosques already master clearly within there in the valley i discern vermilion as if issuing from the fire they were and he to me the fire eternal that kindles them within makes them look red as thou beholdest in this nether hell then we arrived within the moats profound that circumvallate that disconsolate city the walls appeared to me to be of iron not without making first a circuit wide we came unto a place where loud the pilot cried out to us debark here is the entrance more than a thousand at the gates i saw out of the heavens rained down who angrily were saying who is this that without death goes through the kingdom of the people dead and my sagacious master made a sign of wishing secretly to speak with them a little then they quelled their great disdain and said come thou alone and he begone who has so boldly entered these dominions let him return alone by his mad road try if he can for thou shalt here remain who hast escorted him through such dark regions think reader if i was discomforted at utterance of the accursed words for never to return here i believed o my dear guide who more than seven times hast rendered me security and drawn me from imminent peril that before me stood do not desert me said i thus undone and if the going farther be denied us let us retrace our steps together swiftly and that lord who had led me thitherward said unto me fear not because our passage none can take from us it by such is given but here await me and thy weary spirit comfort and nourish with a better hope for in this nether world i will not leave thee so onward goes and there abandons me my father sweet and i remain in doubt for no and yes within my head contend i could not hear what he proposed to them but with them there he did not linger long ere each within in rivalry ran back they closed the portals those our adversaries on my lords breast who had remained without and turned to me with footsteps far between his eyes cast down his forehead shorn had he of all its boldness and he said with sighs who has denied to me the dolesome houses and unto me thou because i am angry fear not for i will conquer in the trial whatever for defence within be planned this arrogance of theirs is nothing new for once they used it at less secret gate which finds itself without a fastening still oer it didst thou behold the dead inscription and now this side of it descends the steep passing across the circles without escort one by whose means the city shall be opened chapter the furies and medusa the angel the city of dis the sixth circle heresiarchs that hue which cowardice brought out on me beholding my conductor backward turn sooner repressed within him his new colour he stopped attentive like a man who listens because the eye could not conduct him far through the black air and through the heavy fog still it behoveth us to win the fight began he else… such offered us herself… o how i long that some one here arrive well i perceived as soon as the beginning he covered up with what came afterward that they were words quite different from the first but none the less his saying gave me fear because i carried out the broken phrase perhaps to a worse meaning than he had into this bottom of the doleful conch doth any eer descend from the first grade which for its pain has only hope cut off this question put i and he answered me seldom it comes to pass that one of us maketh the journey upon which i go true is it once before i here below was conjured by that pitiless erictho who summoned back the shades unto their bodies naked of me short while the flesh had been before within that wall she made me enter to bring a spirit from the circle of judas that is the lowest region and the darkest and farthest from the heaven which circles all well know i the way therefore be reassured this fen which a prodigious stench exhales encompasses about the city dolent where now we cannot enter without anger and more he said but not in mind i have it because mine eye had altogether drawn me towrds the high tower with the redflaming summit where in a moment saw i swift uprisen the three infernal furies stained with blood who had the limbs of women and their mien and with the greenest hydras were begirt small serpents and cerastes were their tresses wherewith their horrid temples were entwined and he who well the handmaids of the queen of everlasting lamentation knew said unto me behold the fierce erinnys this is megaera on the lefthand side she who is weeping on the right alecto tisiphone is between and then was silent each one her breast was rending with her nails they beat them with their palms and cried so loud that i for dread pressed close unto the poet medusa come so we to stone will change him all shouted looking down in evil hour avenged we not on theseus his assault turn thyself round and keep thine eyes close shut for if the gorgon appear and thou shouldst see it no more returning upward would there be thus said the master and he turned me round himself and trusted not unto my hands so far as not to blind me with his own o ye who have undistempered intellects observe the doctrine that conceals itself beneath the veil of the mysterious verses and now there came across the turbid waves the clangour of a sound with terror fraught because of which both of the margins trembled not otherwise it was than of a wind impetuous on account of adverse heats that smites the forest and without restraint the branches rends beats down and bears away right onward laden with dust it goes superb and puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds mine eyes he loosed and said direct the nerve of vision now along that ancient foam there yonder where that smoke is most intense even as the frogs before the hostile serpent across the water scatter all abroad until each one is huddled in the earth more than a thousand ruined souls i saw thus fleeing from before one who on foot was passing oer the styx with soles unwet from off his face he fanned that unctuous air waving his left hand oft in front of him and only with that anguish seemed he weary well i perceived one sent from heaven was he and to the master turned and he made sign that i should quiet stand and bow before him ah how disdainful he appeared to me he reached the gate and with a little rod he opened it for there was no resistance o banished out of heaven people despised thus he began upon the horrid threshold whence is this arrogance within you couched wherefore recalcitrate against that will from which the end can never be cut off and which has many times increased your pain what helpeth it to butt against the fates your cerberus if you remember well for that still bears his chin and gullet peeled then he returned along the miry road and spake no word to us but had the look of one whom other care constrains and goads than that of him who in his presence is and we our feet directed towrds the city after those holy words all confident within we entered without any contest and i who inclination had to see what the condition such a fortress holds soon as i was within cast round mine eye and see on every hand an ample plain full of distress and torment terrible even as at arles where stagnant grows the rhone even as at pola near to the quarnaro that shuts in italy and bathes its borders the sepulchres make all the place uneven so likewise did they there on every side saving that there the manner was more bitter for flames between the sepulchres were scattered by which they so intensely heated were that iron more so asks not any art all of their coverings uplifted were and from them issued forth such dire laments sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented and i my master what are all those people who having sepulture within those tombs make themselves audible by doleful sighs and he to me here are the heresiarchs with their disciples of all sects and much more than thou thinkest laden are the tombs here like together with its like is buried and more and less the monuments are heated and when he to the right had turned we passed between the torments and high parapets chapter farinata and cavalcante de cavalcanti discourse on the knowledge of the damned now onward goes along a narrow path between the torments and the city wall my master and i follow at his back o power supreme that through these impious circles turnest me i began as pleases thee speak to me and my longings satisfy the people who are lying in these tombs might they be seen already are uplifted the covers all and no one keepeth guard and he to me they all will be closed up when from jehoshaphat they shall return here with the bodies they have left above their cemetery have upon this side with epicurus all his followers who with the body mortal make the soul but in the question thou dost put to me within here shalt thou soon be satisfied and likewise in the wish thou keepest silent and i good leader i but keep concealed from thee my heart that i may speak the less nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me o tuscan thou who through the city of fire goest alive thus speaking modestly be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest a native of that noble fatherland to which perhaps i too molestful was upon a sudden issued forth this sound from out one of the tombs wherefore i pressed fearing a little nearer to my leader and unto me he said turn thee what dost thou behold there farinata who has risen from the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him i had already fixed mine eyes on his and he uprose erect with breast and front een as if hell he had in great despite and with courageous hands and prompt my leader thrust me between the sepulchres towards him exclaiming let thy words explicit be as soon as i was at the foot of his tomb somewhat he eyed me and as if disdainful then asked of me who were thine ancestors i who desirous of obeying was concealed it not but all revealed to him whereat he raised his brows a little upward then said he fiercely adverse have they been to me and to my fathers and my party so that two several times i scattered them if they were banished they returned on all sides i answered him the first time and the second but yours have not acquired that art aright then there uprose upon the sight uncovered down to the chin a shadow at his side i think that he had risen on his knees round me he gazed as if solicitude he had to see if some one else were with me but after his suspicion was all spent weeping he said to me if through this blind prison thou goest by loftiness of genius where is my son and why is he not with thee and i to him i come not of myself he who is waiting yonder leads me here whom in disdain perhaps your guido had his language and the mode of punishment already unto me had read his name on that account my answer was so full up starting suddenly he cried out how saidst thou—he had is he not still alive does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes when he became aware of some delay which i before my answer made supine he fell again and forth appeared no more but the other magnanimous at whose desire i had remained did not his aspect change neither his neck he moved nor bent his side and if continuing his first discourse they have that art he said not learned aright that more tormenteth me than doth this bed but fifty times shall not rekindled be the countenance of the lady who reigns here ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art and as thou wouldst to the sweet world return say why that people is so pitiless against my race in each one of its laws whence i to him the slaughter and great carnage which have with crimson stained the arbia cause such orisons in our temple to be made after his head he with a sigh had shaken there i was not alone he said nor surely without a cause had with the others moved but there i was alone where every one consented to the laying waste of florence he who defended her with open face ah so hereafter may your seed repose i him entreated solve for me that knot which has entangled my conceptions here it seems that you can see if i hear rightly beforehand whatsoeer time brings with it and in the present have another mode we see like those who have imperfect sight the things he said that distant are from us so much still shines on us the sovereign ruler when they draw near or are is wholly vain our intellect and if none brings it to us not anything know we of your human state hence thou canst understand that wholly dead will be our knowledge from the moment when the portal of the future shall be closed then i as if compunctious for my fault said now then you will tell that fallen one that still his son is with the living joined and if just now in answering i was dumb tell him i did it because i was thinking already of the error you have solved me and now my master was recalling me wherefore more eagerly i prayed the spirit that he would tell me who was with him there he said with more than a thousand here i lie within here is the second frederick and the cardinal and of the rest i speak not thereon he hid himself and i towards the ancient poet turned my steps reflecting upon that saying which seemed hostile to me he moved along and afterward thus going he said to me why art thou so bewildered and i in his inquiry satisfied him let memory preserve what thou hast heard against thyself that sage commanded me and now attend here and he raised his finger when thou shalt be before the radiance sweet of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold from her thoult know the journey of thy life unto the left hand then he turned his feet we left the wall and went towards the middle along a path that strikes into a valley which even up there unpleasant made its stench chapter the broken rocks pope anastasius general descrip tion of the inferno and its divisions upon the margin of a lofty bank which great rocks broken in a circle made we came upon a still more cruel throng and there by reason of the horrible excess of stench the deep abyss throws out we drew ourselves aside behind the cover of a great tomb whereon i saw a writing which said pope anastasius i hold whom out of the right way photinus drew slow it behoveth our descent to be so that the sense be first a little used to the sad blast and then we shall not heed it the master thus and unto him i said some compensation find that the time pass not idly and he thou seest i think of that my son upon the inside of these rocks began he then to say are three small circles from grade to grade like those which thou art leaving they all are full of spirits maledict but that hereafter sight alone suffice thee hear how and wherefore they are in constraint of every malice that wins hate in heaven injury is the end and all such end either by force or fraud afflicteth others but because fraud is mans peculiar vice more it displeases god and so stand lowest the fraudulent and greater dole assails them all the first circle of the violent is but since force may be used against three persons in three rounds tis divided and constructed to god to ourselves and to our neighbour can we use force i say on them and on their things as thou shalt hear with reason manifest a death by violence and painful wounds are to our neighbour given and in his substance ruin and arson and injurious levies whence homicides and he who smites unjustly marauders and freebooters the first round tormenteth all in companies diverse man may lay violent hands upon himself and his own goods and therefore in the second round must perforce without avail repent whoever of your world deprives himself who games and dissipates his property and weepeth there where he should jocund be violence can be done the deity in heart denying and blaspheming him and by disdaining nature and her bounty and for this reason doth the smallest round seal with its signet sodom and cahors and who disdaining god speaks from the heart fraud wherewithal is every conscience stung a man may practise upon him who trusts and him who doth no confidence imburse this latter mode it would appear dissevers only the bond of love which nature makes wherefore within the second circle nestle hypocrisy flattery and who deals in magic falsification theft and simony panders and barrators and the like filth by the other mode forgotten is that love which nature makes and what is after added from which there is a special faith engendered hence in the smallest circle where the point is of the universe upon which dis is seated whoeer betrays for ever is consumed and i my master clear enough proceeds thy reasoning and full well distinguishes this cavern and the people who possess it but tell me those within the fat lagoon whom the wind drives and whom the rain doth beat and who encounter with such bitter tongues wherefore are they inside of the red city not punished if god has them in his wrath and if he has not wherefore in such fashion and unto me he said why wanders so thine intellect from that which it is wont or sooth thy mind where is it elsewhere looking hast thou no recollection of those words with which thine ethics thoroughly discusses the dispositions three that heaven abides not— incontinence and malice and insane bestiality and how incontinence less god offendeth and less blame attracts if thou regardest this conclusion well and to thy mind recallest who they are that up outside are undergoing penance clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons they separated are and why less wroth justice divine doth smite them with its hammer o sun that healest all distempered vision thou dost content me so when thou resolvest that doubting pleases me no less than knowing once more a little backward turn thee said i there where thou sayest that usury offends goodness divine and disengage the knot philosophy he said to him who heeds it noteth not only in one place alone after what manner nature takes her course from intellect divine and from its art and if thy physics carefully thou notest after not many pages shalt thou find that this your art as far as possible follows as the disciple doth the master so that your art is as it were gods grandchild from these two if thou bringest to thy mind genesis at the beginning it behoves mankind to gain their life and to advance and since the usurer takes another way nature herself and in her follower disdains he for elsewhere he puts his hope but follow now as i would fain go on for quivering are the fishes on the horizon and the wain wholly over caurus lies and far beyond there we descend the crag chapter the minotaur the seventh circle the violent the river phlegethon the violent against their neigh bours the centaurs tyrants the place where to descend the bank we came was alpine and from what was there moreover of such a kind that every eye would shun it such as that ruin is which in the flank smote on this side of trent the adige either by earthquake or by failing stay for from the mountains top from which it moved unto the plain the cliff is shattered so some path twould give to him who was above even such was the descent of that ravine and on the border of the broken chasm the infamy of crete was stretched along who was conceived in the fictitious cow and when he us beheld he bit himself even as one whom anger racks within my sage towards him shouted peradventure thou thinkst that here may be the duke of athens who in the world above brought death to thee get thee gone beast for this one cometh not instructed by thy sister but he comes in order to behold your punishments as is that bull who breaks loose at the moment in which he has received the mortal blow who cannot walk but staggers here and there the minotaur beheld i do the like and he the wary cried run to the passage while he wroth tis well thou shouldst descend thus down we took our way oer that discharge of stones which oftentimes did move themselves beneath my feet from the unwonted burden thoughtful i went and he said thou art thinking perhaps upon this ruin which is guarded by that brute anger which just now i quenched now will i have thee know the other time i here descended to the nether hell this precipice had not yet fallen down but truly if i well discern a little before his coming who the mighty spoil bore off from dis in the supernal circle upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley trembled so that i thought the universe was thrilled with love by which there are who think the world ofttimes converted into chaos and at that moment this primeval crag both here and elsewhere made such overthrow but fix thine eyes below for draweth near the river of blood within which boiling is whoeer by violence doth injure others o blind cupidity o wrath insane that spurs us onward so in our short life and in the eternal then so badly steeps us i saw an ample moat bent like a bow as one which all the plain encompasses conformable to what my guide had said and between this and the embankments foot centaurs in file were running armed with arrows as in the world they used the chase to follow beholding us descend each one stood still and from the squadron three detached themselves with bows and arrows in advance selected and from afar one cried unto what torment come ye who down the hillside are descending tell us from there if not i draw the bow my master said our answer will we make to chiron near you there in evil hour that will of thine was evermore so hasty then touched he me and said this one is nessus who perished for the lovely dejanira and for himself himself did vengeance take and he in the midst who at his breast is gazing is the great chiron who brought up achilles that other pholus is who was so wrathful thousands and thousands go about the moat shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges out of the blood more than his crime allots near we approached unto those monsters fleet chiron an arrow took and with the notch backward upon his jaws he put his beard after he had uncovered his great mouth he said to his companions are you ware that he behind moveth whateer he touches thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men and my good guide who now was at his breast where the two natures are together joined replied indeed he lives and thus alone me it behoves to show him the dark valley necessity and not delight impels us some one withdrew from singing halleluja who unto me committed this new office no thief is he nor i a thievish spirit but by that virtue through which i am moving my steps along this savage thoroughfare give us some one of thine to be with us and who may show us where to pass the ford and who may carry this one on his back for tis no spirit that can walk the air upon his right breast chiron wheeled about and said to nessus turn and do thou guide them and warn aside if other band may meet you we with our faithful escort onward moved along the brink of the vermilion boiling wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments people i saw within up to the eyebrows and the great centaur said tyrants are these who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging here they lament their pitiless mischiefs here is alexander and fierce dionysius who upon sicily brought dolorous years that forehead there which has the hair so black is azzolin and the other who is blond obizzo is of esti who in truth up in the world was by his stepson slain then turned i to the poet and he said now he be first to thee and second i a little farther on the centaur stopped above a folk who far down as the throat seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth a shade he showed us on one side alone saying he cleft asunder in gods bosom the heart that still upon the thames is honoured then people saw i who from out the river lifted their heads and also all the chest and many among these i recognised thus ever more and more grew shallower that blood so that the feet alone it covered and there across the moat our passage was even as thou here upon this side beholdest the boiling stream that aye diminishes the centaur said i wish thee to believe that on this other more and more declines its bed until it reunites itself where it behoveth tyranny to groan justice divine upon this side is goading that attila who was a scourge on earth and pyrrhus and sextus and for ever milks the tears which with the boiling it unseals in rinier da corneto and rinier pazzo who made upon the highways so much war then back he turned and passed again the ford chapter the wood of thorns the harpies the violent against themselves suicides pier della vigna lano and ja copo da sant andrea not yet had nessus reached the other side when we had put ourselves within a wood that was not marked by any path whatever not foliage green but of a dusky colour not branches smooth but gnarled and intertangled not appletrees were there but thorns with poison such tangled thickets have not nor so dense those savage wild beasts that in hatred hold twixt cecina and corneto the tilled places there do the hideous harpies make their nests who chased the trojans from the strophades with sad announcement of impending doom broad wings have they and necks and faces human and feet with claws and their great bellies fledged they make laments upon the wondrous trees and the good master ere thou enter farther know that thou art within the second round thus he began to say and shalt be till thou comest out upon the horrible sand therefore look well around and thou shalt see things that will credence give unto my speech i heard on all sides lamentations uttered and person none beheld i who might make them whence utterly bewildered i stood still i think he thought that i perhaps might think so many voices issued through those trunks from people who concealed themselves from us therefore the master said if thou break off some little spray from any of these trees the thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain then stretched i forth my hand a little forward and plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn and the trunk cried why dost thou mangle me after it had become embrowned with blood it recommenced its cry why dost thou rend me hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever men once we were and now are changed to trees indeed thy hand should be more pitiful even if the souls of serpents we had been as out of a green brand that is on fire at one of the ends and from the other drips and hisses with the wind that is escaping so from that splinter issued forth together both words and blood whereat i let the tip fall and stood like a man who is afraid had he been able sooner to believe my sage made answer o thou wounded soul what only in my verses he has seen not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand whereas the thing incredible has caused me to put him to an act which grieveth me but tell him who thou wast so that by way of some amends thy fame he may refresh up in the world to which he can return and the trunk said so thy sweet words allure me i cannot silent be and you be vexed not that i a little to discourse am tempted i am the one who both keys had in keeping of fredericks heart and turned them to and fro so softly in unlocking and in locking that from his secrets most men i withheld fidelity i bore the glorious office so great i lost thereby my sleep and pulses the courtesan who never from the dwelling of caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes death universal and the vice of courts inflamed against me all the other minds and they inflamed did so inflame augustus that my glad honours turned to dismal mournings my spirit in disdainful exultation thinking by dying to escape disdain made me unjust against myself the just i by the roots unwonted of this wood do swear to you that never broke i faith unto my lord who was so worthy of honour and to the world if one of you return let him my memory comfort which is lying still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it waited awhile and then since he is silent the poet said to me lose not the time but speak and question him if more may please thee whence i to him do thou again inquire concerning what thou thinkst will satisfy me for i cannot such pity is in my heart therefore he recommenced so may the man do for thee freely what thy speech implores spirit incarcerate again be pleased to tell us in what way the soul is bound within these knots and tell us if thou canst if any from such members eer is freed then blew the trunk amain and afterward the wind was into such a voice converted with brevity shall be replied to you when the exasperated soul abandons the body whence it rent itself away minos consigns it to the seventh abyss it falls into the forest and no part is chosen for it but where fortune hurls it there like a grain of spelt it germinates it springs a sapling and a forest tree the harpies feeding then upon its leaves do pain create and for the pain an outlet like others for our spoils shall we return but not that any one may them revest for tis not just to have what one casts off here we shall drag them and along the dismal forest our bodies shall suspended be each to the thorn of his molested shade we were attentive still unto the trunk thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us when by a tumult we were overtaken in the same way as he is who perceives the boar and chase approaching to his stand who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches and two behold upon our lefthand side naked and scratched fleeing so furiously that of the forest every fan they broke he who was in advance now help death help and the other one who seemed to lag too much was shouting lano were not so alert those legs of thine at joustings of the toppo and then perchance because his breath was failing he grouped himself together with a bush behind them was the forest full of black shemastiffs ravenous and swift of foot as greyhounds who are issuing from the chain on him who had crouched down they set their teeth and him they lacerated piece by piece thereafter bore away those aching members thereat my escort took me by the hand and led me to the bush that all in vain was weeping from its bloody lacerations o jacopo it said of sant andrea what helped it thee of me to make a screen what blame have i in thy nefarious life when near him had the master stayed his steps he said who wast thou that through wounds so many art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech and he to us o souls that hither come to look upon the shameful massacre that has so rent away from me my leaves gather them up beneath the dismal bush i of that city was which to the baptist changed its first patron wherefore he for this forever with his art will make it sad and were it not that on the pass of arno some glimpses of him are remaining still those citizens who afterwards rebuilt it upon the ashes left by attila in vain had caused their labour to be done of my own house i made myself a gibbet chapter the sand waste and the rain of fire the violent against god capaneus the statue of time and the four infernal rivers because the charity of my native place constrained me gathered i the scattered leaves and gave them back to him who now was hoarse then came we to the confine where disparted the second round is from the third and where a horrible form of justice is beheld clearly to manifest these novel things i say that we arrived upon a plain which from its bed rejecteth every plant the dolorous forest is a garland to it all round about as the sad moat to that there close upon the edge we stayed our feet the soil was of an arid and thick sand not of another fashion made than that which by the feet of cato once was pressed vengeance of god o how much oughtest thou by each one to be dreaded who doth read that which was manifest unto mine eyes of naked souls beheld i many herds who all were weeping very miserably and over them seemed set a law diverse supine upon the ground some folk were lying and some were sitting all drawn up together and others went about continually those who were going round were far the more and those were less who lay down to their torment but had their tongues more loosed to lamentation oer all the sandwaste with a gradual fall were raining down dilated flakes of fire as of the snow on alp without a wind as alexander in those torrid parts of india beheld upon his host flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground whence he provided with his phalanxes to trample down the soil because the vapour better extinguished was while it was single thus was descending the eternal heat whereby the sand was set on fire like tinder beneath the steel for doubling of the dole without repose forever was the dance of miserable hands now there now here shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds master began i thou who overcomest all things except the demons dire that issued against us at the entrance of the gate who is that mighty one who seems to heed not the fire and lieth lowering and disdainful so that the rain seems not to ripen him and he himself who had become aware that i was questioning my guide about him cried such as i was living am i dead if jove should weary out his smith from whom he seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt wherewith upon the last day i was smitten and if he wearied out by

rebehold the beauteous stars when it shall pleasure thee to say i was see that thou speak of us unto the people then they broke up the wheel and in their flight it seemed as if their agile legs were wings not an amen could possibly be said so rapidly as they had disappeared wherefore the master deemed best to depart i followed him and little had we gone before the sound of water was so near us that speaking we should hardly have been heard even as that stream which holdeth its own course the first from monte veso towrds the east upon the lefthand slope of apennine which is above called acquacheta ere it down descendeth into its low bed and at forli is vacant of that name reverberates there above san benedetto from alps by falling at a single leap where for a thousand there were room

right side and at a little distance from the verge he cast it down into that deep abyss it must needs be some novelty respond i said within myself to the new signal the master with his eye is following so ah me how very cautious men should be with those who not alone behold the act but with their wisdom look into the thoughts he said to me soon there will upward come what i await and what thy thought is dreaming must soon reveal itself unto thy sight aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood a man should close his lips as far as may be because without his fault it causes shame but here i cannot and reader by the notes of this my comedy to thee i swear so may they not be void of lasting favour athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere i saw a figure swimming upward come

ashore its head and bust but on the border did not drag its tail the face was as the face of a just man its semblance outwardly was so benign and of a serpent all the trunk beside two paws it had hairy unto the armpits the back and breast and both the sides it had depicted oer with nooses and with shields with colours more groundwork or broidery never in cloth did tartars make nor turks nor were such tissues by arachne laid as sometimes wherries lie upon the shore that part are in the water part on land and as among the guzzling germans there the beaver plants himself to wage his war so that vile monster lay upon the border which is of stone and shutteth in the sand his tail was wholly quivering in the void contorting upwards the envenomed fork that in the guise of scorpion armed its point the guide said now perforce must turn aside our way a little even to that beast malevolent that yonder coucheth him we therefore on the right side descended and made ten steps upon the outer verge completely to avoid the sand and flame and after we are come to him i see a little farther off upon the sand a people sitting near the hollow place then said to me the master so that full experience of this round thou bear away now go and see what their condition is there let thy conversation be concise till thou returnest i will speak with him that he concede to us his stalwart shoulders thus farther still upon the outermost head of that seventh circle all alone i went where sat the melancholy folk out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe this way that way they helped them with their hands now from the flames and now from the hot soil not otherwise in summer do the dogs now with the foot now with the muzzle when by fleas or flies or gadflies they are bitten when i had turned mine eyes upon the faces of some on whom the dolorous fire is falling not one of them i knew but i perceived that from the neck of each there hung a pouch which certain colour had and certain blazon and thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding and as i gazing round me come among them upon a yellow pouch i azure saw that had the face and posture of a lion proceeding then the current of my sight another of them saw i red as blood display a goose more white than butter is and one who with an azure sow and gravid emblazoned had his little pouch of white said unto me what

licks its nose and fearing lest my longer stay might vex him who had warned me not to tarry long backward i turned me from those weary souls i found my guide who had already mounted upon the back of that wild animal and said to me now be both strong and bold now we descend by stairways such as these mount thou in front for i will be midway so that the tail may have no power to harm thee such as he is who has so near the ague of quartan that his nails are blue already and trembles all but looking at the shade even such became i at those proffered words but shame in me his menaces produced which maketh servant strong before good master i seated me upon those monstrous shoulders i wished to say and yet the voice came not as i believed take heed that thou embrace me but he who other times had rescued me in other peril soon as i had mounted within his arms encircled and sustained me and said now geryon bestir thyself the circles large and the descent be little think of the novel burden which thou hast even as the little vessel shoves from shore backward still backward so he thence withdrew and when he wholly felt himself afloat there where his breast had been he turned his tail and that extended like an eel he moved and with his paws drew to himself the air a greater fear i do not think there was what time abandoned phaeton the reins whereby the heavens as still appears were scorched nor when the wretched icarus his flanks felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax his father crying an ill way thou takest than was my own when i perceived myself on all sides in the air and saw extinguished the sight of everything but of the monster onward he goeth swimming slowly slowly wheels and descends but i perceive it only by wind upon my face and from below i heard already on the right the whirlpool making a horrible crashing under us whence i thrust out my head with eyes cast downward then was i still more fearful of the abyss because i fires beheld and heard laments whereat i trembling all the closer cling i saw then for before i had not seen it the turning and descending by great horrors that were approaching upon divers sides as falcon who has long been on the wing who without seeing either lure or bird maketh the falconer say ah me thou stoopest descendeth weary whence he started swiftly thorough a hundred circles and alights far from his master sullen and

third while i was going on mine eyes by one encountered were and straight i said already with sight of this one i am not unfed therefore i stayed my feet to make him out and with me the sweet guide

while speaking in this manner with his scourge a demon smote him and said get thee gone pander there are no women here for coin i joined myself again unto mine escort thereafterward with footsteps few we came to where a crag projected from the bank this very easily did we ascend and turning to the right along its ridge from those eternal circles we departed when we were there where it is hollowed out beneath to give a passage to the scourged the guide said wait and see that on thee strike the vision of those others evilborn of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces because together with us they have gone from the old bridge we looked upon the train which towrds us came upon the other border and which the scourges in like manner smite and the good master without my inquiring said to me

that sticks there and with the eyes and nostrils wages war the bottom is so deep no place suffices to give us sight of it without ascending the archs back where most the crag impends thither we came and thence down in the moat i saw a people smothered in a filth that out of human privies seemed to flow and whilst below there with mine eye i search i saw one with his head so foul with ordure it was not clear if he were clerk or layman he screamed to me wherefore art thou so eager to look at me more than the other foul ones and i to him because if i remember i have already seen thee with dry

many a voyage has made one hammers at the prow one at the stern this one makes oars and that one cordage twists another mends the mainsail and the mizzen thus not by fire but by the art divine was boiling down below there a dense pitch which upon every side the bank belimed i saw it but i did not see within it aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised and all swell up and resubside compressed the while below there fixedly i gazed my leader crying out beware beware drew me unto himself from where i stood then i turned round as one who is impatient to see what it behoves him to escape and whom a sudden terror doth unman who while he looks delays not his departure and i beheld behind us a black devil running along upon the crag approach ah how ferocious was he in his aspect and how he seemed to me in action ruthless with open wings and light upon his feet his shoulders which sharppointed were and high a sinner did encumber with both haunches and he held clutched the sinews of the feet from off our bridge he said o malebranche behold one of the elders of saint zita plunge him beneath for i return for others unto that town which is well furnished with them all there are barrators except bonturo no into yes for money there is changed he hurled him down and over the hard crag turned round and never was a mastiff loosened in so much hurry to pursue a thief the other sank and rose again face downward but the demons under cover of the bridge cried here the santo volto has no place here swims one otherwise than in the serchio therefore if for our gaffs thou wishest not do not uplift thyself above the pitch they seized him then with more than a hundred rakes they said it here behoves thee to dance covered that if thou canst thou secretly mayest pilfer not otherwise the cooks their scullions make immerse into the middle of the caldron the meat with hooks so that it may not float said the good master to me that it be not apparent thou art here crouch thyself down behind a jag that thou mayest have some screen and for no outrage that is done to me be thou afraid because these things i know for once before was i in such a scuffle then he passed on beyond the bridges head and as upon the sixth bank he arrived need was for him to have a steadfast front with the same fury and the same uproar as dogs leap out upon a mendicant who on a sudden begs whereer he stops they issued from beneath the little bridge and turned against him all their grapplingirons but he cried out be none of you malignant before those hooks of yours lay hold of me let one of you step forward who may hear me and then take counsel as to grappling me they all cried out let malacoda go whereat one started and the rest stood still and he came to him saying what avails it thinkest thou malacoda to behold me advanced into this place my master said safe hitherto from all your skill of fence without the will divine and fate auspicious let me go on for it in heaven is willed that i another show this savage road then was his arrogance so humbled in him that he let fall his grapnel at his feet and to the others said now strike him not and unto me my guide o thou who sittest among the splinters of the bridge crouched down securely now return to me again wherefore i started and came swiftly to him and all the devils forward thrust themselves so that i feared they would not keep their compact and thus beheld i once afraid the soldiers who issued under safeguard from caprona seeing themselves among so many foes close did i press myself with all my person beside my leader and turned not mine eyes from off their countenance which was not good they lowered their rakes and wilt thou have me hit him they said to one another on the rump and answered yes see that thou nick him with it but the same demon who was holding parley with my conductor turned him very quickly and said be quiet be quiet scarmiglione then said to us you can no farther go forward upon this crag because is lying all shattered at the bottom the sixth arch and if it still doth please you to go onward pursue your way along upon this rock near is another crag that yields a path yesterday five hours later than this hour one thousand and two hundred sixtysix years were complete that here the way was broken i send in that direction some of mine to see if any one doth air himself go ye with them for they will not be vicious step forward alichino and calcabrina began he to cry out and thou cagnazzo and barbariccia do thou guide the ten come forward libicocco and draghignazzo and tusked ciriatto and graffiacane and farfarello and mad rubicante search ye all round about the boiling pitch let these be safe as far as the next crag that all unbroken passes oer the dens o me what is it master that i see pray let us go i said without an escort if thou knowest how since for myself i ask none if thou art as observant as thy wont is dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth and with their brows are threatening woe to us and he to me i will not have thee fear let them gnash on according to their fancy because they do it for those boiling wretches along the lefthand dike they wheeled about but first had each one thrust his tongue between his teeth towards their leader for a signal and he had made a trumpet of his rump chapter ciampolo friar gomita and michael zanche the ma labranche quarrel i have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp begin the storming and their muster make and sometimes starting off for their escape vauntcouriers have i seen upon your land o aretines and foragers go forth tournaments stricken and the joustings run sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells with kettledrums and signals of the castles and with our own and with outlandish things but never yet with bagpipe so uncouth did i see horsemen move nor infantry nor ship by any sign of land or star we went upon our way with the ten demons ah savage company but in the church with saints and in the tavern with the gluttons ever upon the pitch was my intent to see the whole condition of that bolgia and of the people who therein were burned even as the dolphins when they make a sign to mariners by arching of the back that they should counsel take to save their vessel thus sometimes to alleviate his pain one of the sinners would display his back and in less time conceal it than it lightens as on the brink of water in a ditch the frogs stand only with their muzzles out so that they hide their feet and other bulk so upon every side the sinners stood but ever as barbariccia near them came thus underneath the boiling they withdrew i saw and still my heart doth shudder at it one waiting thus even as it comes to pass one frog remains and down another dives and graffiacan who most confronted him grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch and drew him up so that he seemed an otter i knew before the names of all of them so had i noted them when they were chosen and when they called each other listened how o rubicante see that thou do lay thy claws upon him so that thou mayst flay him cried all together the accursed ones and i my master see to it if thou canst that thou mayst know who is the luckless wight thus come into his adversaries hands near to the side of him my leader drew asked of him whence he was and he replied i in the kingdom of navarre was born my mother placed me servant to a lord for she had borne me to a ribald knave destroyer of himself and of his things then i domestic was of good king thibault i set me there to practise barratry for which i pay the reckoning in this heat and ciriatto from whose mouth projected on either side a tusk as in a boar caused him to feel how one of them could rip among malicious cats the mouse had come but barbariccia clasped him in his arms and said stand ye aside while i enfork him and to my master he turned round his head ask him again he said if more thou wish to know from him before some one destroy him the guide now tell then of the other culprits knowest thou any one who is a latian under the pitch and he i separated lately from one who was a neighbour to it would that i still were covered up with him for i should fear not either claw nor hook and libicocco we have borne too much and with his grapnel seized him by the arm so that by rending he tore off a tendon eke draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him down at the legs whence their decurion turned round and round about with evil look when they again somewhat were pacified of him who still was looking at his wound demanded my conductor without stay who was that one from whom a luckless parting thou sayest thou hast made to come ashore and he replied it was the friar gomita he of gallura vessel of all fraud who had the enemies of his lord in hand and dealt so with them each exults thereat money he took and let them smoothly off as he says and in other offices a barrator was he not mean but sovereign foregathers with him one don michael zanche of logodoro and of sardinia to gossip never do their tongues feel tired o me see that one how he grinds his teeth still farther would i speak but am afraid lest he to scratch my itch be making ready and the grand provost turned to farfarello who rolled his eyes about as if to strike said stand aside there thou malicious bird if you desire either to see or hear the terrorstricken recommenced thereon tuscans or lombards i will make them come but let the malebranche cease a little so that these may not their revenges fear and i down sitting in this very place for one that i am will make seven come when i shall whistle as our custom is to do whenever one of us comes out cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted shaking his head and said just hear the trick which he has thought of down to throw himself whence he who snares in great abundance had responded i by far too cunning am when i procure for mine a greater sadness alichin held not in but running counter unto the rest said to him if thou dive i will not follow thee upon the gallop but i will beat my wings above the pitch the height be left and be the bank a shield to see if thou alone dost countervail us o thou who readest thou shalt hear new sport each to the other side his eyes averted he first who most reluctant was to do it the navarrese selected well his time planted his feet on land and in a moment leaped and released himself from their design whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame but he most who was cause of the defeat therefore he moved and cried thou art oertakern but little it availed for wings could not outstrip the fear the other one went under and flying upward he his breast directed not otherwise the duck upon a sudden dives under when the falcon is approaching and upward he returneth cross and weary infuriate at the mockery calcabrina flying behind him followed close desirous the other should escape to have a quarrel and when the barrator had disappeared he turned his talons upon his companion and grappled with him right above the moat but sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk to clapperclaw him well and both of them fell in the middle of the boiling pond a sudden intercessor was the heat but neertheless of rising there was naught to such degree they had their wings belimed lamenting with the others barbariccia made four of them fly to the other side with all their gaffs and very speedily this side and that they to their posts descended they stretched their hooks towards the pitchensnared who were already baked within the crust and in this manner busied did we leave them chapter escape from the malabranche the sixth bolgia hypo crites catalano and loderingo caiaphas silent alone and without company we went the one in front the other after as go the minor friars along their way upon the fable of aesop was directed my thought by reason of the present quarrel where he has spoken of the frog and mouse for mo and issa are not more alike than this one is to that if well we couple end and beginning with a steadfast mind and even as one thought from another springs so afterward from that was born another which the first fear within me double made thus did i ponder these on our account are laughed to scorn with injury and scoff so great that much i think it must annoy them if anger be engrafted on illwill they will come after us more merciless than dog upon the leveret which he seizes i felt my hair stand all on end already with terror and stood backwardly intent when said i master if thou hidest not thyself and me forthwith of malebranche i am in dread we have them now behind us i so imagine them i already feel them and he if i were made of leaded glass thine outward image i should not attract sooner to me than i imprint the inner just now thy thoughts came in among my own with similar attitude and similar face so that of both one counsel sole i made if peradventure the right bank so slope that we to the next bolgia can descend we shall escape from the imagined chase not yet he finished rendering such opinion when i beheld them come with outstretched wings not far remote with will to seize upon us my leader on a sudden seized me up even as a mother who by noise is wakened and close beside her sees the enkindled flames who takes her son and flies and does not stop having more care of him than of herself so that she clothes her only with a shift and downward from the top of the hard bank supine he gave him to the pendent rock that one side of the other bolgia walls neer ran so swiftly water through a sluice to turn the wheel of any landbuilt mill when nearest to the paddles it approaches as did my master down along that border bearing me with him on his breast away as his own son and not as a companion hardly the bed of the ravine below his feet had reached ere they had reached the hill right over us but he was not afraid for the high providence which had ordained to place them ministers of the fifth moat the power of thence departing took from all a painted people there below we found who went about with footsteps very slow weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished they had on mantles with the hoods low down before their eyes and fashioned of the cut that in cologne they for the monks are made without they gilded are so that it dazzles but inwardly all leaden and so heavy that frederick used to put them on of straw o everlastingly fatiguing mantle again we turned us still to the left hand along with them intent on their sad plaint but owing to the weight that weary folk came on so tardily that we were new in company at each motion of the haunch whence i unto my leader see thou find some one who may by deed or name be known and thus in going move thine eye about and one who understood the tuscan speech cried to us from behind stay ye your feet ye who so run athwart the dusky air perhaps thoult have from me what thou demandest whereat the leader turned him and said wait and then according to his pace proceed i stopped and two beheld i show great haste of spirit in their faces to be with me but the burden and the narrow way delayed them when they came up long with an eye askance they scanned me without uttering a word then to each other turned and said together he by the action of his throat seems living and if they dead are by what privilege go they uncovered by the heavy stole then said to me tuscan who to the college of miserable hypocrites art come do not disdain to tell us who thou art and i to them born was i and grew up in the great town on the fair river of arno and with the body am ive always had but who are ye in whom there trickles down along your cheeks such grief as i behold and what pain is upon you that so sparkles and one replied to me these orange cloaks are made of lead so heavy that the weights cause in this way their balances to creak frati gaudenti were we and bolognese i catalano and he loderingo named and together taken by thy city as the wont is to take one man alone for maintenance of its peace and we were such that still it is apparent round gardingo o friars began i your iniquitous…  but said no more for to mine eyes there rushed one crucified with three stakes on the ground when me he saw he writhed himself all over blowing into his beard with suspirations and the friar catalan who noticed this said to me this transfixed one whom thou seest counselled the pharisees that it was meet to put one man to torture for the people crosswise and naked is he on the path as thou perceivest and he needs must feel whoever passes first how much he weighs and in like mode his fatherinlaw is punished within this moat and the others of the council which for the jews was a malignant seed and thereupon i saw virgilius marvel oer him who was extended on the cross so vilely in eternal banishment then he directed to the friar this voice be not displeased if granted thee to tell us if to the right hand any pass slope down by which we two may issue forth from here without constraining some of the black angels to come and extricate us from this deep then he made answer nearer than thou hopest there is a rock that forth from the great circle proceeds and crosses all the cruel valleys save that at this tis broken and does not bridge it you will be able to mount up the ruin that sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises the leader stood awhile with head bowed down then said the business badly he recounted who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder and the friar many of the devils vices once heard i at bologna and among them that hes a liar and the father of lies thereat my leader with great strides went on somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks whence from the heavyladen i departed after the prints of his beloved feet chapter the seventh bolgia thieves vanni fucci serpents in that part of the

laments like a poor wretch who knows not what to do then he returns and hope revives again seeing the world has changed its countenance in little time and takes his shepherds crook and forth the little lambs to pasture drives thus did the master fill me with alarm when i beheld his forehead so disturbed and to the ailment came as soon the plaster for as we came unto the ruined bridge the leader turned to me with that sweet look which at the mountains foot i first beheld his arms he opened after some advisement within himself elected looking first well at the ruin and laid hold of me and even as he who acts and meditates for aye it seems that he provides beforehand so upward lifting me towards the summit of a huge rock he scanned another crag saying to that one grapple afterwards but try first if tis such that it will hold thee this was no way for one clothed with a cloak for hardly we he light and i pushed upward were able to ascend from jag to jag and had it not been that upon that precinct shorter was the ascent than on the other he i know not but i had been dead beat but because malebolge towrds the mouth of the profoundest well is all inclining the structure of each valley doth import that one bank rises and the other sinks still we arrived at length upon the point wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder the breath was from my lungs so milked away when i was up that i could go no farther nay i sat down upon my first arrival now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth my master said for sitting upon down or under quilt one cometh not to fame withouten

with its heavy body it sink not a longer stairway it behoves thee mount tis not enough from these to have departed let it avail thee if thou understand me then i uprose showing myself provided better with breath than i did feel myself and said go on for i am strong and bold upward we took our way along the crag which jagged was and narrow and difficult and more precipitous far than that before speaking i went not to appear exhausted whereat a voice from the next moat came forth not well adapted to articulate words i know not what it said though oer the back i now was of the arch that passes there but he seemed moved to anger who was speaking i was bent downward but my living eyes could not attain the bottom for the dark wherefore i master see that thou arrive at the next round and let us descend the wall for as from hence i hear and understand not so i look down and nothing i distinguish other response he said i make thee not except the doing for the modest asking ought to be followed by the deed in silence we from the bridge descended at its head where it connects itself with the eighth bank and then was manifest to me the bolgia and i beheld therein a terrible throng of serpents and of such a monstrous kind that the remembrance still congeals my blood let libya boast no longer with her sand for if chelydri jaculi and phareae she breeds with cenchri and with amphisbaena neither so many plagues nor so malignant eer showed she with all ethiopia nor with whatever on the red sea is among this cruel and most dismal throng people were running naked and affrighted without the hope of hole or heliotrope they had their hands with serpents bound behind them these riveted upon their reins the tail and head and were in front of them entwined and lo at one who was upon our side there darted forth a serpent which transfixed him there where the neck is knotted to the shoulders nor o so quickly eer nor i was written as he took fire and burned and ashes wholly behoved it

was my worthy den and i unto the guide tell him to stir not and ask what crime has thrust him here below for once a man of blood and wrath i saw him and the sinner who had heard dissembled not but

along his back as far as where our countenance begins upon the shoulders just behind the nape with wings wide open was a dragon lying and he sets fire to all that he encounters my master said that one is cacus who beneath the rock upon mount aventine created oftentimes a lake of blood he goes not on the same road with his brothers by reason of the fraudulent theft he made of the great herd which he had near to him whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath the mace of hercules who peradventure gave him a hundred and he felt not ten while he was speaking thus he had passed by and spirits three had underneath us come of which nor i aware was nor my leader until what time they shouted who are you on which account our story made a halt and then we were intent on them alone i did not know them but it came to pass as it is wont to happen by some chance that one to name the other was compelled exclaiming where can cianfa have remained whence i so that the leader might attend upward from chin to nose my finger laid if thou art reader slow now to believe what i shall say it will no marvel be for i who saw it hardly can admit it as i was holding raised on them my brows behold a serpent with six feet darts forth in front of one and fastens wholly on him with middle feet it bound him round the paunch and with the forward ones his arms it seized then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other the hindermost it stretched upon his thighs and put its tail through in between the two and up behind along the reins outspread it ivy was never fastened by its barbs unto a tree so as this horrible reptile upon the others limbs entwined its own then they stuck close as if of heated wax they had been made and intermixed their colour nor one nor other seemed now what he was een as proceedeth on before the flame upward along the paper a brown colour which is not black as yet and the white dies the other two looked on and each of them cried out o me agnello how thou changest behold thou now art neither two nor one already the two heads had one become when there appeared to us two figures mingled into one face wherein the two were lost of the four lists were fashioned the two arms the thighs and legs the belly and the chest members became that never yet were seen every original aspect there was cancelled two and yet none did the perverted image appear and such departed with slow pace even as a lizard under the great scourge of days canicular exchanging hedge lightning appeareth if the road it cross thus did appear coming towards the bellies of the two others a small fiery serpent livid and black as is a peppercorn and in that part whereat is first received our aliment it one of them transfixed then downward fell in front of him extended the one transfixed looked at it but said naught nay rather with feet motionless he yawned just as if sleep or fever had assailed him he at the serpent gazed and it at him one through the wound the other through the mouth smoked violently and the smoke commingled henceforth be silent lucan where he mentions wretched sabellus and nassidius and wait to hear what now shall be shot forth be silent ovid of cadmus and arethusa for if him to a snake her to fountain converts he fabling that i grudge him not because two natures never front to front has he transmuted so that both the forms to interchange their matter ready were together they responded in such wise that to a fork the serpent cleft his tail and eke the wounded drew his feet together the legs together with the thighs themselves adhered so that in little time the juncture no sign whatever made that was apparent he with the cloven tail assumed the figure the other one was losing and his skin became elastic and the others hard i saw the arms draw inward at the armpits and both feet of the reptile that were short lengthen as much as those contracted were thereafter the hind feet together twisted became the member that a man conceals and of his own the wretch had two created while both of them the exhalation veils with a new colour and engenders hair on one of them and depilates the other the one uprose and down the other fell though turning not away their impious lamps underneath which each one his muzzle changed he who was standing drew it towrds the temples and from excess of matter which came thither issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks what did not backward run and was retained of that excess made to the face a nose and the lips thickened far as was befitting he who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward and backward draws the ears into his head in the same manner as the snail its horns and so the tongue which was entire and apt for speech before is cleft and the biforked in the other closes up and the smoke ceases the soul which to a reptile had been changed along the valley hissing takes to flight and after him the other speaking sputters then did he turn upon him his new shoulders and said to the other ill have buoso run crawling as i have done along this road in this way i beheld the seventh ballast shift and reshift and here be my excuse the novelty if aught my pen transgress and notwithstanding that mine eyes might be somewhat bewildered and my mind dismayed they could not flee away so secretly but that i plainly saw puccio sciancato and he it was who sole of three companions which came in

each along the gorge of the intrenchment was moving for not one reveals the theft and every flame a sinner steals away i stood upon the bridge uprisen to see so that if i had seized not on a rock down had i fallen without being pushed and the leader who beheld me so attent exclaimed within the fires the spirits are each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns my master i replied by hearing thee i am more sure but i surmised already it might be so and already wished to ask thee who is within that fire which comes so cleft at top it seems uprising from the pyre where was eteocles with his brother placed he answered me within there are tormented ulysses and diomed and thus together they unto vengeance run as unto wrath and there within their flame do they lament the ambush of the horse which made the door whence issued forth the romans gentle seed therein is wept the craft for which being dead deidamia still deplores achilles and pain for the palladium there is borne if they within those sparks possess the power to speak i said thee master much i pray and repray that the prayer be worth a thousand that thou make no denial of awaiting until the horned flame shall hither come thou seest that with desire i lean towards it and he to me worthy is thy entreaty of much applause and therefore i accept it but take heed that thy tongue restrain itself leave me to speak because i have conceived that which thou wishest for they might disdain perchance since they were greeks discourse of thine when now the flame had come unto that point where to my leader it seemed time and place after this fashion did i hear him speak o ye who are twofold within one fire if i deserved of you while i was living if i deserved of you or much or little when in the world i wrote the lofty verses do not move on but one of you declare whither being lost he went away to die then of the antique flame the greater horn murmuring began to wave itself about even as a flame doth which the wind

shores i saw as far as spain far as morocco and the isle of sardes and the others which that sea bathes round about i and my company were old and slow when at that narrow passage we arrived where hercules his landmarks set as signals that man no farther onward should adventure on the right hand behind me left i seville and on the other already had left ceuta o brothers who amid a hundred

consider ye the seed from which ye sprang ye were not made to live like unto brutes but for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge so eager did i render my companions with this brief exhortation for the voyage that then i hardly could have held them back and having turned our stern unto the morning we of the oars made wings for our mad flight evermore gaining on the larboard side already all the stars of the other pole the night beheld and ours so very low it did not rise above the ocean floor five times rekindled and as many quenched had been the splendour underneath the moon since we had entered into the deep pass when there appeared to us a mountain dim from distance and it seemed to me so high as i had never any one beheld joyful were we and soon it turned to weeping for out of the new land a whirlwind rose and smote upon the fore part of the ship three times it made her whirl with all the waters at the fourth time it made the stern uplift and the prow downward go as pleased another until the sea above us closed again chapter guido da montefeltro his deception by pope boniface viii already was the flame erect and quiet to speak no more and now departed from us with the permission of the gentle poet when yet another which behind it came caused us to turn our eyes upon its top by a confused sound that issued from it as the sicilian bull that bellowed first with the lament of him and that was right who with his file had modulated it bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted that notwithstanding it was made of brass still it appeared with agony transfixed thus

dreaming wishes it may be a dream so that he craves what is as if it were not such i became not having power to speak for to excuse myself i wished and still excused myself and did not think i did it

say what town is this and he to me because thou peerest forth athwart the darkness at too great a distance it happens that thou errest in thy fancy well shalt thou see if thou arrivest there how much the sense deceives itself by distance therefore a little faster spur thee on then tenderly he took me by the hand and said before we farther have advanced that the reality may seem to thee less strange know that these are not towers but giants and they are in the well around the bank from navel downward one and all of them as when the fog is vanishing away little by little doth the sight refigure whateer the mist that crowds the air conceals so piercing through the dense and darksome air more and more near approaching towrd the verge my error fled and fear came over me because as on

for where the argument of intellect is added unto evil will and power no rampart can the people make against it his face appeared to me as long and large as is at rome the pinecone of saint peters and in proportion were the other bones so that the margin which an apron was down from the middle showed so much of him above it that to reach up to his hair three frieslanders in vain had vaunted them

another far more fierce and large in binding him who might the master be i cannot say but he had pinioned close behind the right arm and in front the other with chains that held him so begirt about from the neck down that on the part uncovered it wound itself as far as the fifth gyre this proud one wished to make experiment of his own power against the supreme jove my leader said whence he has such a guerdon ephialtes is his name he showed great prowess what time the giants terrified the gods the arms he wielded never more he moves and i to him if possible i should wish that of the measureless briareus these eyes of mine might have experience whence he replied thou shalt behold antaeus close by here who can speak and is unbound who at the bottom of all crime shall place us much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see and he is bound and fashioned like to this one save that he seems in aspect more ferocious there never was an earthquake of such might that it could shake a tower so violently as ephialtes suddenly shook himself then was i more afraid of death than ever for nothing more was needful than the fear if i had not beheld the manacles then we proceeded farther in advance and to antaeus came who full five ells without the head forth issued from the cavern o thou who in the valley fortunate which scipio the heir of glory made when hannibal turned back with

still not a tear i shed nor answer made all of that day nor yet the night thereafter until another sun rose on the world as now a little glimmer made its way into the dolorous prison and i saw upon four faces my own very aspect both of my hands in agony i bit and thinking that i did it from desire of eating on a sudden they uprose and said they father much less pain twill give us if thou do eat

that finds a barrier in the eyes turns itself inward to increase the anguish because the earliest tears a cluster form and in the manner of a crystal visor fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full and notwithstanding that as in a callus because of cold all sensibility its station had abandoned in my face still it appeared to me i felt some wind whence i my master who sets this in motion is not

saw and for the wind i drew myself behind my guide because there was no other shelter now was i and with fear in verse i put it there where the shades were wholly covered up and glimmered through like unto straws in glass some prone are lying others stand erect this with the head and that one with the soles another bowlike face to feet inverts when in advance so far we had proceeded that it my master pleased to show to me the creature who once had the beauteous semblance he from before me moved and made me stop saying behold dis and behold the place where thou with fortitude must arm thyself how frozen i became and powerless then ask it not reader for i write it not because all language would be insufficient i did not die and i alive remained not think for thyself now hast thou

of his consider now how great must be that whole which unto such a part conforms itself were he as fair once as he now is foul and lifted up his brow against his maker well may proceed from him all tribulation o what a marvel it appeared to me when i beheld three faces on his head the one in front and that vermilion was two were the others that were joined with this above the middle part of either shoulder and they were joined together at the crest and the righthand one seemed twixt white and yellow the left was such to look upon as those who come from where the nile falls valleyward underneath each came forth two mighty wings such as befitting were so great a bird sails of the sea i never saw so large no feathers had they but as of a bat their fashion was and he was waving them so that three winds proceeded forth therefrom thereby cocytus wholly was congealed with six eyes did he weep and down three chins trickled the teardrops and the bloody drivel at every mouth he with his teeth was crunching a sinner in the manner of a brake so that he three of them tormented thus to him in front the biting was as naught unto the clawing for sometimes the spine utterly stripped of

breath turned round his head where he had had his legs and grappled to the hair as one who mounts so that to hell i thought we were returning keep fast thy hold for by such stairs as these the master said panting as one fatigued must we perforce depart from so much evil then through the opening of a rock he issued and down upon the margin seated me then towrds me he outstretched his wary step i lifted up mine eyes and thought to see lucifer in the same way i had left him and i beheld him upward hold his legs and if i then became disquieted let stolid people think who do not see what the point is beyond which i had passed rise up the master said upon thy feet the way is long and difficult the road and now the sun to middletierce returns it was not any palace corridor there where we were but dungeon natural with floor uneven and unease of light ere from the abyss i tear myself away my master said i when i had arisen to draw me from an error speak a little where is the ice and how is this one fixed thus upside down and how in such short time from eve to morn has the sun made his transit and he to me thou still imaginest thou art beyond the centre where i grasped the hair of the fell worm who mines the world that side thou wast so long as i descended when round i turned me thou didst pass the point to which things heavy draw from every side and now beneath the hemisphere art come opposite that which overhangs the vast dryland and neath whose cope was put to death the man who without sin was born and lived thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere which makes the other face of the judecca here it is morn when it is evening there and he who with his hair a stairway made us still fixed remaineth as he was before upon this side he fell down out of heaven and all the

the pure air as far as the first circle unto mine eyes did recommence delight soon as i issued forth from the dead air which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast the beauteous planet that to love incites was making all the orient to laugh veiling the fishes that were in her escort to the right hand i turned and fixed my mind upon the other pole and saw four stars neer seen before save by the primal people rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven o thou septentrional and widowed site because thou art deprived of seeing these when from regarding them i had withdrawn turning a little to the other pole there where the wain had disappeared already i saw beside me an old man alone worthy of so much reverence in his look that more owes not to father any son a long beard and with white hair intermingled he wore in semblance like unto the tresses of which a double list fell on his breast the rays of the four consecrated stars did so adorn his countenance with light that

word and wholly drew myself unto my guide and turned mine eyes to him and he began son follow thou my steps let us turn back for on this side declines the plain unto its lower boundaries the dawn was vanquishing the matin hour which fled before it so that from afar i recognised the trembling of the sea along the solitary plain we went as one who unto the lost road returns and till he finds it seems to go in vain as soon as we were come to where the dew fights with the sun and being in a part where shadow falls little evaporates both of his hands upon the grass outspread in gentle manner did my master place whence i who of his action was aware extended unto him my tearful cheeks there did he make in me uncovered wholly that hue which hell had covered up in me then came we down upon the desert shore which never yet saw navigate its waters any that afterward had known return there he begirt me as the other pleased o marvellous for even as he culled the humble plant such it sprang up again suddenly there where he uprooted it chapter the celestial pilot casella the departure already had the sun the horizon reached whose circle of meridian covers oer jerusalem with its most lofty point and night that opposite to him revolves was issuing forth from ganges with the scales that fall from out her hand when she exceedeth so that the white and the vermilion cheeks of beautiful aurora where i was by too great age were changing into orange we still were on the border of the sea like people who are thinking of their road who go in heart and with the body stay and lo as when upon the approach of morning through the gross vapours mars grows fiery red down in the west upon the ocean floor appeared to me—may i again behold it— a light along the sea so swiftly coming its motion by no flight of wing is equalled from which when i a little had withdrawn mine eyes that i might question my conductor again i saw it brighter grown and larger then on each side of it appeared to me i knew not what of white and underneath it little by little there came forth another my master yet had uttered not a word while the first whiteness into wings unfolded but when he clearly recognised the pilot he cried make haste make haste to bow the knee behold the angel of god fold thou thy hands henceforward shalt thou see such officers see how he scorneth human arguments so that nor oar he wants nor other sail than his own wings between so distant shores see how he holds them pointed up to heaven fanning the air with the eternal pinions that do not moult themselves like mortal hair then as still nearer and more near us came the bird divine more radiant he appeared so that near by the eye could not endure him but down i cast it and he came to shore with a small vessel very swift and light so that the water swallowed naught thereof upon the stern stood the celestial pilot beatitude seemed written in his face and more than a hundred spirits sat within in exitu israel de aegypto they chanted all together in one voice with whatso in that psalm is after written then made he sign of holy rood upon them whereat all cast themselves upon the shore and he departed swiftly as he came the throng which still remained there unfamiliar seemed with the place all round about them gazing as one who in new matters makes essay on every side was darting forth the day the sun who had with his resplendent shafts from the midheaven chased forth the capricorn when the new people lifted up their faces towards us saying to us if ye know show us the way to go unto the mountain and answer made virgilius ye believe perchance that we have knowledge of this place but we are strangers even as yourselves just now we came a little while before you another way which was so rough and steep that mounting will henceforth seem sport to us the souls who had from seeing me draw breath become aware that i was still alive pallid in their astonishment became and as to messenger who bears the olive the people throng to listen to the news and no one shows himself afraid of crowding so at the sight of me stood motionless those fortunate spirits all of them as if oblivious to go and make them fair one from among them saw i coming forward as to embrace me with such great affection that it incited me to do the like o empty shadows save in aspect only three times behind it did i clasp my hands as oft returned with them to my own breast i think with wonder i depicted me whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew and i pursuing it pressed farther forward gently it said that i should stay my steps then knew i who it was and i entreated that it would stop awhile to speak with me it made reply to me even as i loved thee in mortal body so i love thee free therefore i stop but wherefore goest thou my own casella to return once more there where i am i make this journey said i but how from thee has so much time be taken and he to me no outrage has been done me if he who takes both when and whom he pleases has many times denied to me this passage for of a righteous will his own is made he sooth to say for three months past has taken whoever wished to enter with all peace whence i who now had turned unto that shore where salt the waters of the tiber grow benignantly by him have been received unto that outlet now his wing is pointed because for evermore assemble there those who towrds acheron do not descend and i if some new law take not from thee memory or practice of the song of love which used to quiet in me all my longings thee may it please to comfort therewithal somewhat this soul of mine that with its body hitherward coming is so much distressed love that within my mind discourses with me forthwith began he so melodiously the melody within me still is sounding my master and myself and all that people which with him were appeared as satisfied as if naught else might touch the mind of any we all of us were moveless and attentive unto his notes and lo the grave old man exclaiming what is this ye laggard spirits what negligence what standing still is this run to the mountain to strip off the slough that lets not god be manifest to you even as when collecting grain or tares the doves together at their pasture met quiet nor showing their accustomed pride if aught appear of which they are afraid upon a sudden leave their food alone because they are assailed by greater care so that fresh company did i behold the song relinquish and go towrds the hill as one who goes and knows not whitherward nor was our own departure less in haste chapter discourse on the limits of reason the foot of the mountain those who died in contumacy of holy church manfredi inasmuch as the instantaneous flight had scattered them asunder oer the

within himself remorseful o noble conscience and without a stain how sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee after his feet had laid aside the haste which mars the dignity of every act my mind that hitherto had been restrained let loose its faculties as if delighted and i my sight directed to the hill that highest towrds the heaven uplifts itself the sun that in our rear was flaming red was broken in front of me into the figure which had in me the stoppage of its rays unto one side i turned me with the fear of being left alone when i beheld only in front of me the ground obscured why dost thou still mistrust my comforter began to say to me turned wholly round dost thou not think me with thee and that i guide thee tis evening there already where is buried the body within which i cast a shadow tis from brundusium taen and naples has it now if in front of me no shadow fall marvel not at it more than at the heavens because one ray impedeth not another to suffer torments both of

unto the mountains foot there so precipitate we found the rock that nimble legs would there have been in vain twixt lerici and turbia the most desert the most secluded pathway is a stair easy and open if compared with that who knoweth now upon which hand the hill slopes down my master said his footsteps staying so that who goeth without wings may mount and while he held his eyes upon the ground examining the nature of the path and i was looking up around the rock on the left hand appeared to me a throng of souls that moved their feet in our direction and did not seem to move they came so slowly lift up thine eyes i to the master said behold on this side who will give us counsel if thou of thine own self can have it not then he looked at me and with frank expression replied let us go there for they come slowly and thou be steadfast in thy hope sweet son still was that people as far off from us after a thousand steps of ours i say as a good thrower with his hand would reach when they all crowded unto the hard masses of the high bank and motionless stood and close as he stands still to look who goes in doubt o happy dead o spirits elect already virgilius made beginning by that peace which i believe is waiting for you all tell us upon what side the mountain slopes so that the going up be possible for to lose time irks him most who most knows as sheep come issuing forth from out the fold by ones and twos and threes and the others stand timidly holding down their eyes and nostrils and what the foremost does the others do huddling themselves against her if she stop simple and quiet and the wherefore know not so moving to approach us thereupon i saw the leader of that fortunate flock modest in face and dignified in gait as soon as those in the advance saw broken the light upon the ground at my right side so that from me the shadow reached the rock they stopped and backward drew themselves somewhat and all the others who came after them not knowing why nor wherefore did the same without your asking i confess to you this is a human body which you see whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft marvel ye not thereat but be persuaded that not without a power which comes from heaven doth he endeavour to surmount this wall the master thus and said those worthy people return ye then and enter in before us making a signal with the back o the hand and one of them began whoeer thou art thus going turn thine eyes consider well if eer thou saw me in the other world i turned me towrds him and looked at him closely blond was he beautiful and of noble aspect but one of his eyebrows had a blow divided when with humility i had disclaimed eer having seen him now behold he said and showed me high upon his breast a wound then said he with a smile i am manfredi the grandson of the empress costanza therefore when thou returnest i beseech thee go to my daughter beautiful the mother of sicilys honour and of aragons and the truth tell her if aught else

against that error is which thinks one soul above another kindles in us and hence whenever aught is heard or seen which keeps the soul intently bent upon it time passes on and we perceive it not because one faculty is that which listens and other that which the soul keeps entire this is as if in bonds and that is free of this i had experience positive in hearing and in gazing at that spirit for fifty full degrees uprisen was the sun and i had not perceived it when we came to where those souls with one accord cried out unto us here is what you ask a greater opening ofttimes hedges up with but a little forkful of his thorns the villager what time the grape imbrowns than was the passageway through which ascended only my leader and myself behind him after that company departed from us one climbs sanleo and descends in noli and mounts the summit of bismantova with feet alone but here one needs must fly with the swift pinions and the plumes i say of great desire conducted after him who gave me hope and made a light for me we mounted upward through the rifted rock and on each side the border pressed upon us and feet and hands the ground beneath required when we were come upon the upper rim of the high bank out on the open slope my master said i what way shall we take and he to me no step of thine descend still up the mount behind me win thy way till some sage escort shall appear to us the summit was so high it vanquished sight and the hillside precipitous far more than line from middle quadrant to the centre spent with fatigue was i when i began o my sweet father turn thee and behold how i remain alone unless thou stay o son he said up yonder drag thyself pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher which on that side encircles all the hill these words of his so spurred me on that i strained every nerve behind him scrambling up until the circle was beneath my feet thereon ourselves we seated both of us turned to the east from which we had ascended for all men are delighted to look back to the low shores mine eyes i first directed then to the sun uplifted them and wondered that on the left hand we were smitten by it the poet well perceived that i was wholly bewildered at the chariot of the light where twixt us and the aquilon it entered whereon he said to me if castor and pollux were in the company of yonder mirror that up and down conducteth with its light thou wouldst behold the zodiacs jagged wheel revolving still more near unto the bears unless it swerved aside from its old track how that may be wouldst thou have power to think collected in thyself imagine zion together with this mount on earth to stand so that they both one sole horizon have and hemispheres diverse whereby the road which phaeton alas knew not to drive thoult see how of necessity must pass this on one side when that upon the other if thine intelligence right clearly heed truly my master said i never yet saw i so clearly as i now discern there where my wit appeared incompetent that the midcircle of supernal motion which in some art is the equator called and aye remains between the sun and winter for reason which thou sayest departeth hence towrds the septentrion what time the hebrews beheld it towrds the region of the heat but if it pleaseth thee i fain would learn how far we have to go for the hill rises higher than eyes of mine have power to rise and he to me this mount is such that ever at the beginning down below tis tiresome and aye the more one climbs the less it hurts therefore when it shall seem so pleasant to thee that going up shall be to thee as easy as going down the current in a boat then at this pathways ending thou wilt be there to repose thy panting breath expect no more i answer and this i know for true and as he finished uttering these words a voice close by us sounded peradventure thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that at sound thereof each one of us turned round and saw upon the left hand a great rock which neither i nor he before had noticed thither we drew and there were persons there who in the shadow stood behind the rock as one through indolence is wont to stand and one of them who seemed to me fatigued was sitting down and both his knees embraced holding his face low down between them bowed o my sweet lord i said do turn thine eye on him who shows himself more negligent then even sloth herself his sister were then he turned round to us and he gave heed just lifting up his eyes above his thigh and said now go thou up for thou art valiant then knew i who he was and the distress that still a little did my breathing quicken my going to him hindered not and after i came to him he hardly raised his head saying hast thou seen clearly how the sun oer thy left shoulder drives his chariot his sluggish attitude and his curt words a little unto laughter moved my lips then i began belacqua i grieve not for thee henceforth but tell me wherefore seated in this place art thou waitest thou an escort or has thy usual habit seized upon thee and he o brother whats the use of climbing since to my torment would not let me go the angel of god who sitteth at the gate first heaven must needs so long revolve me round outside thereof as in my life it did since the good sighs i to the end postponed unless eer that some prayer may bring me aid which rises from a heart that lives in grace what profit others that in heaven are heard not meanwhile the poet was before me mounting and saying come now see the sun has touched meridian and from the shore the night covers already with her foot

finger at me one shouted see it seems as if shone not the sunshine on the left of him below and like one living seems he to conduct him mine eyes i turned at utterance of these words and saw them watching with astonishment but me but me and the light which was broken why doth thy mind so occupy itself the master said that thou thy pace dost slacken what matters it to thee what here is whispered come after me and let the people talk stand like a steadfast tower that never wags its top for all the blowing of the winds for evermore the man in whom is springing thought upon thought removes from him the mark because the force of one the other weakens what could i say in answer but i come i said it somewhat with that colour tinged which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy meanwhile along the mountainside across came people in advance of us a little singing the miserere verse by verse when they became aware i gave no place for passage of the sunshine through my body they changed their song into a long hoarse oh and two of them in form of messengers ran forth to meet us and demanded of us of your condition make us cognisant and said my master ye can go your way and carry back again to those who sent you that this ones body is of very flesh if they stood still because they saw his shadow as i suppose enough is answered them him let them honour it may profit

others wheeled towrds us like troops that run without a rein this folk that presses unto us is great and cometh to implore thee said the poet so still go onward and in going listen o soul that goest to beatitude with the same members wherewith thou wast born shouting they came a little stay thy steps look if thou eer hast any of us seen so that oer yonder thou bear news of him ah why dost thou go on ah why not stay long since we all were slain by violence and sinners even to the latest hour then did a light from heaven admonish us so that both penitent and pardoning forth from life we issued

bending down its wings when i who something had of adam in me vanquished by sleep upon the grass reclined there were all five of us already sat just at the hour when her sad lay begins the little swallow near unto the morning perchance in memory of her former woes and when the mind of man a wanderer more from the flesh and less by thought imprisoned almost prophetic in its visions is in dreams it seemed to me i saw suspended an eagle in the sky with plumes of gold with wings wide open and intent to stoop and this it seemed to me was where had been by ganymede his kith and kin abandoned when to the high consistory he was rapt i thought within myself perchance he strikes from habit only here and from elsewhere disdains to bear up any in his feet then wheeling somewhat more it seemed to me terrible as the lightning he descended and snatched me upward even to the fire therein it seemed that he and i were burning and the imagined fire did scorch me so that of necessity my sleep was broken not otherwise achilles started up around him turning his awakened eyes and knowing not the place in which he was what time from chiron stealthily his mother carried him sleeping in her arms to scyros wherefrom the greeks withdrew him afterwards than i upstarted when from off my face sleep fled away and pallid i became as doth the man who freezes with affright only my comforter was at my side and now the sun was more than two hours high and turned towards the seashore was my face be not intimidated said my lord be reassured for all is well with us do not restrain but put forth all thy strength thou hast at length arrived at purgatory see there the cliff that closes it around see there the entrance where it seems disjoined whilom at dawn which doth precede the day when inwardly thy spirit was asleep upon the flowers that deck the land below there came a lady and said i am lucia let me take this one up who is asleep so will i make his journey easier for him sordello and the other noble shapes remained she took thee and as day grew bright upward she came and i upon her footsteps she laid thee here and first her beauteous eyes that open entrance pointed out to me then she and sleep together went away in guise of one whose doubts are reassured and who to confidence his fear doth change after the truth has been discovered to him so did i change and when without disquiet my leader saw me up along the cliff he moved and i behind him towrd the height reader thou seest well how i exalt my theme and therefore if with greater art i fortify it marvel not thereat nearer approached we and were in such place that there where first appeared to me a rift like to a crevice that disparts a wall i saw a portal and three stairs beneath diverse in colour to go up to it and a gatekeeper who yet spake no word and as i opened more and more mine eyes i saw him seated on the highest stair such in the face that i endured it not and in his hand he had a naked sword which so reflected back the sunbeams towrds us that oft in vain i lifted up mine eyes tell it from where you are what ist you wish began he to exclaim where is the escort take heed your coming hither harm you not a lady of heaven with these things conversant my master answered him but even now said to us thither go there is the portal and may she speed your footsteps in all good again began the courteous janitor come forward then unto these stairs of ours thither did we approach and the first stair was marble white so polished and so smooth i mirrored myself therein as i appear the second tinct of deeper hue than perse was of a calcined and uneven stone cracked all asunder lengthwise and across the third that uppermost rests massively porphyry seemed to me as flaming red as blood that from a vein is spirting forth both of his feet was holding upon this the angel of god upon the threshold seated which seemed to me a stone of diamond along the three stairs upward with good will did my conductor draw me saying ask humbly that he the fastening may undo devoutly at the holy feet i cast me for mercys sake besought that he would open but first upon my breast three times i smote seven ps upon my forehead he described with the swords point and take heed that thou wash these wounds when thou shalt be within he said ashes or earth that dry is excavated of the same colour were with his attire and from beneath it he drew forth two keys one was of gold and the other was of silver first with the white and after with the yellow plied he the door so that i was content whenever faileth either of these keys so that it turn not rightly in the lock he said to us this entrance doth not open more precious one is but the other needs more art and intellect ere it unlock for it is that which doth the knot unloose from peter i have them and he bade me err rather in opening than in keeping shut if people but fall down before my feet then pushed the portals of the sacred door exclaiming enter but i give you warning that forth returns whoever looks behind and when upon their hinges were turned round the swivels of that consecrated gate which are of metal massive and sonorous roared not so loud nor so discordant seemed tarpeia when was taen from it the good metellus wherefore meagre it remained at the first thunderpeal i turned attentive and te deum laudamus seemed to hear in voices mingled with sweet melody exactly such an image rendered me that which i heard as we are wont to catch when people singing with the organ stand for now we hear and now hear not the words chapter the needles eye the first circle the proud the sculptures on the wall when we had crossed the threshold of the door which the perverted love of souls disuses because it makes the crooked way seem straight reechoing i heard it closed again and if i had turned back mine eyes upon it what for my failing had been fit excuse we mounted upward through a rifted rock which undulated to this side and that even as a wave receding and advancing here it behoves us use a little art began my leader to adapt ourselves now here now there to the receding side and this our footsteps so infrequent made that sooner had the moons decreasing disk regained its bed to sink again to rest than we were forth from out that needles eye but when we free and in the open were there where the mountain backward piles itself i wearied out and both of us uncertain about our way we stopped upon a plain more desolate than roads across the deserts from where its margin borders on the void to foot of the high bank that ever rises a human body three times told would measure and far as eye of mine could wing its flight now on the left and on the right flank now the same this cornice did appear to me thereon our feet had not been moved as yet when i perceived the embankment round about which all right of ascent had interdicted to be of marble white and so adorned with sculptures that not only polycletus but natures self had there been put to shame the angel who came down to earth with tidings of peace that had been wept for many a year and opened heaven from its long interdict in front of us appeared so truthfully there sculptured in a gracious attitude he did not seem an image that is silent one would have sworn that he was saying ave for she was there in effigy portrayed who turned the key to ope the exalted love and in her mien this language had impressed ecce ancilla dei as distinctly as any figure stamps itself in wax keep not thy mind upon one place alone the gentle master said who had me standing upon that side where people have their hearts whereat i moved mine eyes and i beheld in rear of mary and upon that side where he was standing who conducted me another story on the rock imposed wherefore i passed virgilius and drew near so that before mine eyes it might be set there sculptured in the selfsame marble were the cart and oxen drawing the holy ark wherefore one dreads an office not appointed people appeared in front and all of them in seven choirs divided of two senses made one say no the other yes they sing likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense which there was imaged forth the eyes and nose were in the yes and no discordant made preceded there the vessel benedight dancing with girded loins the humble psalmist and more and less than king was he in this opposite represented at the window of a great palace michal looked upon him even as a woman scornful and afflicted i moved my feet from where i had been standing to examine near at hand another story which after michal glimmered white upon me there the high glory of the roman prince was chronicled whose great beneficence moved gregory to his great victory tis of the emperor trajan i am speaking and a poor widow at his bridle stood in attitude of weeping and of grief around about him seemed it thronged and full of cavaliers and the eagles in the gold above them visibly in the wind were moving the wretched woman in the midst of these seemed to be saying give me vengeance lord for my dead son for whom my heart is breaking and he to answer her now wait until i shall return and she my lord like one in whom grief is impatient shouldst thou not return and he who shall be where i am will give it thee and she good deed of others what boots it thee if thou neglect thine own whence he now comfort thee for it behoves

shouldst swerve from thy good purposes because thou hearest how god ordaineth that the debt be paid attend not to the fashion of the torment think of what follows think that at the worst it cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence master began i that which i behold moving towards us seems to me not persons and what i know not so in sight i waver and he to me the grievous quality of this their torment bows them so to earth that my own eyes at first contended with it but look there fixedly and disentangle by sight what cometh underneath those stones already canst thou see how each is stricken o ye proud christians wretched weary ones who in the vision of the mind infirm confidence have in your backsliding steps do ye not comprehend that we are worms born to bring forth the angelic butterfly that flieth unto judgment without screen why floats aloft your spirit high in air like are ye unto insects undeveloped even as the worm in whom formation fails as to sustain a ceiling or a

fabric wrought in evil hour for thee o rehoboam no more seems to threaten thine image there but full of consternation a chariot bears it off when none pursues displayed moreoer the adamantine pavement how unto his own mother made alcmaeon costly appear the luckless ornament displayed how his own sons did throw themselves upon sennacherib within the temple and how he being dead they left him there

thus meditating lo there an angel who is making haste to come towards us lo returning is from service of the day the sixth handmaiden with reverence thine acts and looks adorn so that he may delight to speed us upward think that this day will never dawn again i was familiar with his admonition ever to lose no time so on this theme he could not unto me speak covertly towards us came the being beautiful vested in white and in his countenance such as appears the tremulous morning star his arms he opened and opened then his wings come said he near at hand here are the steps and easy from henceforth is the ascent at this announcement few are they who come o human creatures born to soar aloft why fall ye thus before a little wind he led us on to where the rock was cleft there smote upon my forehead with his wings then a safe passage promised unto me as on the right hand to ascend the mount where seated is the church that lordeth it oer the wellguided above rubaconte the bold abruptness of the ascent is broken by stairways that were made there in the age when still were safe the ledger and the stave een thus attempered is the bank which falls sheer downward from the second circle there but on this side and that the high rock graze as we were turning thitherward our persons beati pauperes spiritu voices sang in such wise that speech could tell it not ah me how different are these entrances from the infernal for with anthems here one enters and below with wild laments we now were hunting up the sacred stairs and it appeared to me by far more easy than on the plain it had appeared before whence i my master say what heavy thing has been uplifted from me so that hardly aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking he answered when the ps which have remained still on thy face almost obliterate shall wholly as the first is be erased thy feet will be so vanquished by good will that not alone they shall not feel fatigue but urging up will be to them delight then did i even as they do who are going with something on the head to them unknown unless the signs of others make them doubt wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful and seeks and finds and doth fulfill the office which cannot be accomplished by the sight and with the fingers of the right hand spread i found but six the letters that had carved upon my temples he who bore the keys upon beholding which my leader smiled chapter the second circle the envious sapia of siena we were upon the summit of the stairs where for the second time is cut away the mountain which ascending shriveth all there in like

smooth with but the livid colour of the stone if to inquire we wait for people here the poet said i fear that peradventure too much delay will our election have then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed made his right side the centre of his motion and turned the left part of himself about o thou sweet light with trust in whom i enter upon this novel journey do thou lead us said he as one within here should be led thou warmest the world thou shinest over it if other reason prompt not otherwise thy rays should evermore our leaders be as much as here is counted for a mile so much already there had we advanced in little time by dint of ready will and towrds us there were heard to fly albeit they were not visible spirits uttering unto loves table courteous invitations the first voice that passed onward in its flight vinum non habent said in accents loud and went reiterating it behind us and ere it wholly grew inaudible because of distance passed another crying i am orestes and it also stayed not o said i father these what voices are they and even as i asked behold the third saying love those from whom ye have had evil and the good master said this circle scourges the sin of envy and on that account are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge the bridle of another sound shall be i think that thou wilt hear it as i judge before thou comest to the pass of pardon but fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast and people thou wilt see before us sitting and each one close against the cliff is seated then wider than at first mine eyes i opened i looked before me and saw shades with mantles not from the colour of the stone diverse and when we were a little farther onward i heard a cry of mary pray for us a cry of michael peter and all saints i do not think there walketh still on earth a man so hard that he would not be pierced with pity at what afterward i saw for when i had approached so near to them that manifest to me their acts became drained was i at the eyes by heavy grief covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me and one sustained the other with his shoulder and all of them were by the bank sustained thus do the blind in want of livelihood stand at the doors of churches asking alms and one upon another leans his head so that in others pity soon may rise not only at the accent of their words but at their aspect which no less implores and as unto the blind the sun comes not so to the shades of whom just now i spake heavens light will not be bounteous of itself for all their lids an iron wire transpierces and sews them up as to a sparhawk

to say and therefore waited not for my demand but said speak and be brief and to the point i had virgilius upon that side of the embankment from which one may fall since by no border tis engarlanded

pilgrim by way of answer this i seemed to hear a little farther on than where i stood whereat i made myself still nearer heard among the rest i saw a shade that waited in aspect and should any one ask how its chin it lifted upward like a blind man spirit i said who stoopest to ascend if thou art he who did reply to me make thyself known to me by place or name sienese was i it replied and with the others here recleanse my guilty life weeping to him to lend himself to us sapient i was not although i sapia was called and i was at anothers harm more happy far than at my own good fortune and that thou mayst not think that i deceive thee hear if i was as foolish as i tell thee the arc already of my years descending my fellowcitizens near unto colle were joined in battle with their adversaries and i was praying god for what he willed routed were they and turned into the bitter passes of flight and i the chase beholding a joy received unequalled by all others so that i lifted upward my bold face crying to god henceforth i fear thee not as did the blackbird at the little sunshine peace i desired with god at the extreme of my existence and as yet would not my debt have been by penitence discharged had it not been that in remembrance held me pier pettignano in his holy prayers who out of charity was grieved for me but who art thou that into our conditions questioning goest and hast thine eyes unbound as i believe and breathing dost discourse mine eyes i said will yet be here taen from me but for short space for small is the offence committed by their being turned with envy far greater is the fear wherein suspended my soul is of the torment underneath for even now the load down there weighs on me and she to me who led thee then among us up here if to return below thou thinkest and i he who is with me and speaks not and living am i therefore ask of me spirit elect if thou wouldst have me move oer yonder yet my mortal feet for thee o this is such a novel thing to

meaning i can penetrate with intellect of mine then answered me he who first spake thou speakest of the arno and said the other to him why concealed this one the appellation of that river even as a man doth of things horrible and thus the shade that questioned was of this himself acquitted i know not but truly tis fit the name of such a valley perish for from its fountainhead where is so pregnant the alpine mountain whence is cleft peloro that in few places it that mark surpasses to where it yields itself in restoration of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up whence have the rivers

forest he leaves it such a thousand years from now in its primeval state tis not rewooded as at the announcement of impending ills the face of him who listens is disturbed from whateer side the peril

made to know their names and question mixed with prayers i made thereof whereat the spirit which first spake to me began again thou wishest i should bring me to do for thee what thoult not do for me

became a stone and then to press myself close to the poet i backward and not forward took a step already on all sides the air was quiet and said he to me that was the hard curb that ought to hold a man within his bounds but you take in the bait so that the hook of the old adversary draws you to him and hence availeth little curb or call the heavens are calling you and wheel around you displaying

was evening and twas midnight here and the rays smote the middle of our faces because by us the mount was so encircled that straight towards the west we now were going when i perceived my forehead overpowered beneath the splendour far more than at first and stupor were to me the things unknown whereat towards the summit of my brow i raised my hands and made myself the visor which the excessive glare diminishes as when from off the water or a mirror the sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side ascending upward in the selfsame measure that it descends and deviates as far from falling of a stone in line direct as demonstrate experiment and art so it appeared to me that by a light refracted there before me i was smitten on which account my sight was swift to flee what is that father sweet from which i cannot so fully screen my sight that it avail me said i and seems towards us to be moving marvel thou not if dazzle thee as yet the family of heaven he answered me an angel tis who comes to

voice he said here enter in to stairway far less steep than are the others we mounting were already thence departed and beati misericordes was behind us sung rejoice thou that oercomest my master and myself we two alone were going upward and i thought in going some profit to acquire from words of his and i to him directed me thus asking what did the spirit of romagna mean mentioning interdict and partnership whence he to me of his own greatest failing he knows the harm and therefore wonder not if he reprove us that we less may rue it because are thither pointed your desires where by companionship each share is lessened envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs but if the love of the supernal sphere should upwardly direct your aspiration there would not be that fear within your breast for there as much the more as one says our so much the more of good each one possesses and more of charity in that cloister burns i am more hungering to be satisfied i said than if i had before been silent and more of doubt within my mind i gather how can it be that boon distributed the more possessors can more wealthy make therein than if by few it be possessed and he to me because thou fixest still thy mind entirely upon earthly things thou pluckest darkness from the very light that goodness infinite and ineffable which is above there runneth unto love as to a lucid body comes the sunbeam so much it gives itself as it finds ardour so that as far as charity extends oer it increases the eternal valour and the more people thitherward aspire more are there to love well and more they love there and as a mirror one reflects the other and if my reasoning appease thee not thou shalt see beatrice and she will fully take from thee this and every other longing endeavour then that soon may be extinct as are the two already the five wounds that close themselves again by being painful even as i wished to say thou dost appease me i saw that i had reached another circle so that my eager eyes made me keep silence there it appeared to me that in a vision ecstatic on a sudden i was rapt and in a temple many persons saw and at the door a woman with the sweet behaviour of a mother saying son why in this manner hast thou dealt with us lo sorrowing thy father and myself were seeking for thee—and as here she ceased that which appeared at first had disappeared then i beheld another with those waters adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever from great disdain of others it is born and saying if of that city thou art lord for whose name was such strife among the gods and whence doth every science scintillate avenge thyself on those audacious arms that clasped our daughter o pisistratus and the lord seemed to me benign and mild to answer her with aspect temperate what shall we do to those who wish us ill if he who loves us be by us condemned then saw i people hot in fire of wrath with stones a young man slaying clamorously still crying to each other kill him kill him and him i saw bow down because of death that weighed already on him to the earth but of his eyes made ever gates to heaven imploring the high lord in so great strife that he would pardon those his persecutors with such an aspect as unlocks compassion soon as my soul had outwardly returned to things external to it which are true did i my not false errors recognize my leader who could see me bear myself like to a man that rouses him from sleep exclaimed what ails thee that thou canst not stand but hast been coming more than half a league veiling thine eyes and with thy legs entangled in guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues o my sweet father if thou listen to me ill tell thee said i what appeared to me when thus from me my legs were taen away and he if thou shouldst have a hundred masks upon thy face from me would not be shut thy cogitations howsoever small what thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail to ope thy heart unto the waters of peace which from the eternal fountain are diffused i did not ask what ails thee as he does who only looketh with the eyes that see not when of the soul bereft the body lies but asked it to give vigour to thy feet thus must we needs urge on the sluggards slow to use their wakefulness when it returns we passed along athwart the twilight peering forward as far as ever eye could stretch against the sunbeams serotine and lucent and lo by slow degrees a smoke approached in our direction sombre as the night nor was there place to hide ones self therefrom this of our eyes and the pure air bereft us chapter marco lombardo lament over the state of the world darkness of hell and of a night deprived of every planet under a poor sky as much as may be tenebrous with cloud neer made unto my sight so thick a veil as did that smoke which there enveloped us nor to the feeling of so rough a texture for not an eye it suffered to stay open whereat mine escort faithful and sagacious drew near to me and offered me his shoulder een as a blind man goes behind his guide lest he should wander or should strike against aught that may harm or peradventure kill him so went i through the bitter and foul air listening unto my leader who said only look that from me thou be not separated voices i heard and every one appeared to supplicate for peace and misericord the lamb of god who takes away our sins still agnus dei their exordium was one word there was in all and metre one so that all harmony appeared among them master i said are spirits those i hear and he to me thou apprehendest truly and they the knot of anger go unloosing now who art thou that cleavest through our smoke and art discoursing of us even as though thou didst by calends still divide the time after this manner by a voice was spoken whereon my master said do thou reply and ask if on this side the way go upward and i o creature that dost cleanse thyself to return beautiful to him who made thee thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me thee will i follow far as is allowed me he answered and if smoke prevent our seeing hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof thereon began i with that swathing band which death unwindeth am i going upward and hither came i through the infernal anguish and if god in his grace has me infolded so that he wills that i behold his court by method wholly out of modern usage conceal not from me who ere death thou wast but tell it me and tell me if i go right for the pass and be thy words our escort lombard was i and i was marco called the world i knew and loved that excellence at which has each one now unbent his bow for mounting upward thou art going right thus he made answer and subjoined i pray thee to pray for me when thou shalt be above and i to him my faith i pledge to thee to do what thou dost ask me but am bursting inly with doubt unless i rid me of it first it was simple and is now made double by thy opinion which makes certain to me here and elsewhere that which i couple with it the world forsooth is utterly deserted by every virtue as thou tellest me and with iniquity is big and covered but i beseech thee point me out the cause that i may see it and to others show it for one in the heavens and here below one puts it a sigh profound that grief forced into ai he first sent forth and then began he brother the world is blind and sooth thou comest from it ye who are living every cause refer still upward to the heavens as if all things they of necessity moved with themselves if this were so in you would be destroyed free will nor any justice would there be in having joy for good or grief for evil the heavens your movements do initiate i say not all but granting that i say it light has been given you for good and evil and free volition which if some fatigue in the first battles with the heavens it suffers afterwards conquers all if well tis nurtured to greater force and to a better nature though free ye subject are and that creates the mind in you the heavens have not in charge hence if the present world doth go astray in you the cause is be it sought in you and i therein will now be thy true spy forth from the hand of him who fondles it before it is like to a little girl weeping and laughing in her childish sport issues the simple soul that nothing knows save that proceeding from a joyous maker gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure of trivial good at first it tastes the savour is cheated by it and runs after it if guide or rein turn not aside its love hence it behoved laws for a rein to place behoved a king to have who at the least of the true city should discern the tower the laws exist but who sets hand to them no one because the shepherd who precedes can ruminate but cleaveth not the hoof wherefore the people that perceives its guide strike

thou sayest has remained in reprobation of the barbarous age either thy speech deceives me or it tempts me he answered me for speaking tuscan to me it seems of good gherardo naught thou knowest by

from that cloud to rays already dead on the low shores o thou imagination that dost steal us so from without sometimes that man perceives not although around may sound a thousand trumpets who moveth thee if sense impel thee not moves thee a light which in the heaven takes form by self or by a will that downward guides it of her impiety who changed her form into the bird that most delights in

fantasy one crucified disdainful and ferocious in countenance and even thus was dying around him were the great ahasuerus esther his wife and the just mordecai who was in word and action so entire and even as this image burst asunder of its own self in fashion of a bubble in which the water it was made of fails there rose up in my vision a young maiden bitterly weeping and she said o queen why hast thou wished in anger to be naught thoust slain thyself lavinia not to lose now hast thou lost me i am she who mourns mother at thine ere at anothers ruin as sleep is broken when upon a sudden new light strikes in upon the eyelids closed and broken quivers ere it dieth wholly so this imagining of mine fell down as soon as the effulgence smote my face greater by far than what is in our wont i turned me round to see where i might be when said a voice here is the passage up which from all other purposes removed me and made my wish so full of eagerness to look and see who was it that was speaking it never rests till meeting face to face but as before the sun which quells the sight and in its own excess its figure veils even so my power was insufficient here this is a spirit divine who in the way of going up directs us without asking and who with his own light himself conceals he does with us as man doth with himself for he who sees the need and waits the asking malignly leans already towrds denial accord we now our feet to such inviting let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark for then we could not till the day return thus my conductor said and i and he together turned our footsteps to a stairway and i as soon as the first step i reached near me perceived a motion as of wings and fanning in the face and saying beati pacifici who are without ill anger already over us were so uplifted the latest sunbeams which the night pursues that upon many sides the stars appeared o manhood mine why dost thou vanish so i said within myself for i perceived the vigour of my legs was put in truce we at the point were where no more ascends the stairway upward and were motionless even as a ship which at the shore arrives and i gave heed a little if i might hear aught whatsoever in the circle new then to my master turned me round and said say my sweet father what delinquency is purged here in the circle where we are although our feet may pause pause not thy speech and he to me the love of good remiss in what it should have done is here restored here plied again the illbelated oar but still more openly to understand turn unto me thy mind and thou shalt gather some profitable fruit from our delay neither creator nor a creature ever son he began was destitute of love natural or spiritual and thou knowest it the natural was ever without error but err the other may by evil object or by too much or by too little vigour while in the first it well directed is and in the second moderates itself it cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure but when to ill it turns and with more care or lesser than it ought runs after good gainst the creator works his own creation hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be the seed within yourselves of every virtue and every act that merits punishment now inasmuch as never from the welfare of its own subject can love turn its sight from their own hatred all things are secure and since we cannot think of any being standing alone nor from the first divided of hating him is all desire cut off hence if discriminating i judge well the evil that one loves is of ones neighbour and this is born in three modes in your clay there are who by abasement of their neighbour hope to excel and therefore only long that from his greatness he may be cast down there are who power grace honour and renown fear they may lose because another rises thence are so sad that the reverse they love and there are those whom injury seems to chafe so that it makes them greedy for revenge and such must needs shape out anothers harm this threefold love is wept for down below now of the other will i have thee hear that runneth after good with measure faulty each one confusedly a good conceives wherein the mind may rest and longeth for it therefore to overtake it each one strives if languid love to look on this attract you or in attaining unto it this cornice after just penitence torments you for it theres other good that does not make man happy tis not felicity tis not the good essence of every good the fruit and root the love that yields itself too much to this above us is lamented in three circles but how tripartite it may be described i say not that thou seek it for thyself chapter virgil further discourses of love and free will the abbot of san zeno an end had put unto his reasoning the lofty teacher and attent was looking into my face if i appeared content and i whom a new thirst still goaded on without was mute and said within perchance the too much questioning i make annoys him but that true father who had comprehended the timid wish that opened not itself by speaking gave me hardihood to speak whence i my sight is master vivified so in thy light that clearly i discern whateer thy speech importeth or describes therefore i thee entreat sweet father dear to teach me love to which thou dost refer every good action and its contrary direct he said towards me the keen eyes of intellect and clear will be to thee the error of the blind who would be leaders the soul which is created apt to love is mobile unto everything that pleases soon as by pleasure she is waked to action your apprehension from some real thing an image draws and in yourselves displays it so that it makes the soul turn unto it and if when turned towards it she incline love is that inclination it is nature which is by pleasure bound in you anew then even as the fire doth upward move by its own form which to ascend is born where longest in its matter it endures so comes the captive soul into desire which is a motion spiritual and neer rests until she doth enjoy the thing beloved now may apparent be to thee how hidden the truth is from those people who aver all love is in itself a laudable thing because its matter may perchance appear aye to be good but yet not each impression is good albeit good may be the wax thy words and my sequacious intellect i answered him have love revealed to me but that has made me more impregned with doubt for if love from without be offered us and with another foot the soul go not if right or wrong she go tis not her merit and he to me what reason seeth here myself can tell thee beyond that await for beatrice since tis a work of faith every substantial form that segregate from matter is and with it is united specific power has in itself collected which without act is not perceptible nor shows itself except by its effect as life does in a plant by the green leaves but still whence cometh the intelligence of the first notions man is ignorant and the affection for the first allurements which are in you as instinct in the bee to make its honey and this first desire merit of praise or blame containeth not now that to this all others may be gathered innate within you

voice from him already we departed were and made endeavour to oercome the road as much as was permitted to our power when i perceived like something that is falling the mountain tremble whence a chill seized on me as seizes him who to his death is going certes so violently shook not delos before latona made her nest therein to give birth to the two eyes of the heaven then upon all sides there began a cry such that the master drew himself towards me saying fear not while i am guiding thee gloria in excelsis deo all were saying from what near i comprehended where it was possible to hear the cry we paused immovable and in suspense even as the shepherds who first heard that song until the trembling ceased and it was finished then we resumed again our holy path watching the shades that lay upon the ground already turned to their accustomed plaint no ignorance ever with so great a strife had rendered me importunate to know if erreth not in this my memory as meditating then i seemed to have nor out of haste to question did i dare nor of myself i there could aught perceive so i went onward timorous and thoughtful chapter the poet statius praise of virgil the natural thirst that neer is satisfied excepting with the water for whose grace the woman of samaria besought put me in travail and haste goaded me along the encumbered path behind my leader and i was pitying that righteous vengeance and lo in the same manner as luke writeth that christ appeared to two upon the way from the sepulchral cave already risen a shade appeared to us and came behind us down gazing on the prostrate multitude nor were we ware of it until it spake saying my brothers may god give you peace we turned us suddenly and virgilius rendered to him the countersign thereto conforming thereon began he in the blessed council thee may the court veracious place in peace that me doth banish in eternal exile how said he and the while we went with speed if ye are shades whom god deigns not on high who up his stairs so far has guided you and said my teacher if thou note the marks which this one bears and which the angel traces well shalt thou see he with the good must reign but because she who spinneth day and night for him had not yet drawn the distaff off which clotho lays for each one and compacts his soul which is thy sister and my own in coming upwards could not come alone by reason that it sees not in our fashion whence i was drawn from out the ample throat of hell to be his guide and i shall guide him as far on as my school has power to lead but tell us if thou knowest why such a shudder erewhile the mountain gave and why together all seemed to cry as far as its moist feet in asking he so hit the very eye of my desire that merely with the hope my thirst became the less unsatisfied naught is there he began that without order may the religion of the mountain feel nor aught that may be foreign to its custom free is it here from every permutation what from itself heaven in itself receiveth can be of this the cause and naught beside because that neither rain nor hail nor snow nor dew nor hoarfrost any higher falls than the short little stairway of three steps dense clouds do not appear nor rarefied nor coruscation nor the daughter of thaumas that often upon earth her region shifts no arid vapour any farther rises than to the top of the three steps i spake of whereon the vicar of peter has his feet lower down perchance it trembles less or more but for the wind that in the earth is hidden i know not how up here it never trembled it trembles here whenever any soul feels itself pure so that it soars or moves to mount aloft and such a cry attends it of purity the will alone gives proof which being wholly free to change its convent takes by surprise the soul and helps it fly first it wills well but the desire permits not which divine justice with the selfsame will there was to sin upon the torment sets and i who have been lying in this pain five hundred years and more but just now felt a free volition for a better seat therefore thou heardst the earthquake and the pious spirits along the mountain rendering praise unto the lord that soon he speed them upwards so said he to him and since we enjoy as much in drinking as the thirst is great i could not say how much it did me good and the wise leader now i see the net that snares you here and how ye are set free why the earth quakes and wherefore ye rejoice now who thou wast be pleased that i may know and why so many centuries thou hast here been lying let me gather from thy words in days when the good titus with the aid of the supremest king avenged the wounds whence issued forth the blood by judas sold under the name that most endures and honours was i on earth that spirit made reply greatly renowned but not with faith as yet my vocal spirit was so sweet that rome me a thoulousian drew unto herself where i deserved to deck my brows with myrtle statius the people name me still on earth i sang of thebes and then of great achilles but on the way fell with my second burden the seeds unto my ardour were the sparks of that celestial flame which heated me whereby more than a thousand have been fired of the aeneid speak i which to me a mother was and was my nurse in song without this weighed i not a drachmas weight and to have lived upon the earth what time virgilius lived i would accept one sun more than i must ere issuing from my ban these words towards me made virgilius turn with looks that in their silence said be silent but yet the power that wills cannot do all things for tears and laughter are such pursuivants unto the passion from which each springs forth in the most truthful least the will they follow i only smiled as one who gives the wink whereat the shade was silent and it gazed into mine eyes where most expression dwells and as thou well mayst consummate a labour so great it said why did thy face just now display to me the lightning of a smile now am i caught on this side and on that one keeps me silent one to speak conjures me wherefore i sigh and i am understood speak said my master and be not afraid of speaking but speak out and say to him what he demands with such solicitude whence i thou peradventure marvellest o antique spirit at the smile i gave but i will have more wonder seize upon thee this one who guides on high these eyes of mine is that virgilius from whom thou didst learn to sing aloud of men and of the gods if other cause thou to my smile imputedst abandon it as false and trust it was those words which thou hast spoken concerning him already he was stooping to embrace my teachers feet but he said to him brother do not for shade thou art and shade beholdest and he uprising now canst thou the sum of love which warms me to thee comprehend when this our vanity i disremember treating a shadow as substantial thing chapter statius denunciation of avarice the sixth circle the gluttonous the mystic tree already was the angel left behind us the angel who to the sixth round had turned us having erased one mark from off my face and those who have in justice their desire had said to us beati in their voices with sitio and without more ended it and i more light than through the other passes went onward so that without any labour i followed upward the swiftfooted spirits when thus virgilius began the love kindled by virtue aye another kindles provided outwardly its flame appear hence from the hour that juvenal descended among us into the infernal limbo who made apparent to me thy affection my kindliness towards thee was as great as ever bound one to an unseen person so that these stairs will now seem short to me but tell me and forgive me as a friend if too great confidence let loose the rein and as a friend now hold discourse with me how was it possible within thy breast for avarice to find place mid so much wisdom as thou wast filled with by thy diligence these words excited statius at first somewhat to laughter afterward he answered each word of thine is loves dear sign to me verily oftentimes do things appear which give fallacious matter to our doubts instead of the true causes which are hidden thy question shows me thy belief to be that i was niggard in the other life it may be from the circle where i was therefore know thou that avarice was removed too far from me and this extravagance thousands of lunar periods have punished and were it not that i my thoughts uplifted when i the passage heard where thou exclaimest as if indignant unto human nature to what impellest thou not o cursed hunger of gold the appetite of mortal men revolving i should feel the dismal joustings then i perceived the hands could spread too wide their wings in spending and repented me as well of that as of my other sins how many with shorn hair shall rise again because of ignorance which from this sin cuts off repentance living and in death and know that the transgression which rebuts by direct opposition any sin together with it here its verdure dries therefore if i have been among that folk which mourns its avarice to purify me for its opposite has this befallen me now when thou sangest the relentless weapons of the twofold affliction of jocasta the singer of the songs bucolic said from that which clio there with thee preludes it does not seem that yet had made thee faithful that faith without which no good works suffice if this be so what candles or what sun scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim thy sails behind the fisherman thereafter and he to him thou first directedst me towards parnassus in its grots to drink and first concerning god didst me enlighten thou didst as he who walketh in the night who bears his light behind which helps him not but wary makes the persons after him when thou didst say the age renews itself justice returns and mans primeval time and a new progeny descends from heaven through thee i poet was through thee a christian but that thou better see what i design to colour it will i extend my hand already was the world in every part pregnant with the true creed disseminated by messengers of the eternal kingdom and thy assertion spoken of above with the new preachers was in unison whence i to visit them the custom took then they became so holy in my sight that when domitian persecuted them not without tears of mine were their laments and all the while that i on earth remained them i befriended and their upright customs made me disparage all the other sects and ere i led the greeks unto the rivers of thebes in poetry i was baptized but out of fear was covertly a christian for a long time professing paganism and this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle to circuit round more than four centuries thou therefore who hast raised the covering that hid from me whatever good i speak of while in ascending we have time to spare tell me in what place is our friend terentius caecilius plautus varro if thou knowest tell me if they are damned and in what alley these persius and myself and others many replied my leader with that grecian are whom more than all the rest the muses suckled in the first circle of the prison blind ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse which has our nurses ever with itself euripides is with us antiphon simonides agatho and many other greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked there some of thine own people may be seen antigone deiphile and argia and there ismene mournful as of old there she is seen who pointed out langia there is tiresias daughter and there thetis and there deidamia with her sisters silent already were the poets both attent once more in looking round about from the ascent and from the walls released and four handmaidens of the day already were left behind and at the pole the fifth was pointing upward still its burning horn what time my guide i think that towrds the edge our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn circling the mount as we are wont to do thus in that region custom was our ensign and we resumed our way with less suspicion for the assenting of that worthy soul they in advance went on and i alone behind them and i listened to their speech which gave me lessons in the art of song but soon their sweet discourses interrupted a tree which midway in the road we found with apples sweet and grateful to the smell and even as a firtree tapers upward from bough to bough so downwardly did that i think in order that no one might climb it on that side where our pathway was enclosed fell from the lofty rock a limpid water and spread itself abroad upon the leaves the poets twain unto the tree drew near and from among the foliage a voice cried of this food ye shall have scarcity then said more thoughtful mary was of making the marriage feast complete and honourable than of her mouth which now for you responds and for their drink the ancient roman women with water were content and daniel disparaged food and understanding won the primal age was beautiful as gold acorns it made with hunger savorous and nectar every rivulet with thirst honey and locusts were the aliments that fed the baptist in the wilderness whence he is glorious and so magnified as by the evangel is revealed to you chapter forese reproof of immodest florentine women the while among the verdant leaves mine eyes i riveted as he is wont to do who wastes his life pursuing little birds my more than father said unto me son come now because the time that is ordained us more usefully should be apportioned out i turned my face and no less soon my steps unto the sages who were speaking so they made the going of no cost to me and lo were heard a song and a lament labia mea domine in fashion such that delight and dolence it brought forth o my sweet father what is this i hear began i and he answered shades that go perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt in the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do who unknown people on the road oertaking turn themselves round to them and do not stop even thus behind us with a swifter motion coming and passing onward gazed upon us a crowd of spirits silent and devout each in his eyes was dark and cavernous pallid in face and so emaciate that from the bones the skin did shape itself i do not think that so to merest rind could erisichthon have been withered up by famine when most fear he had of it thinking within myself i said behold this is the folk who lost jerusalem when mary made a prey of her own son their sockets were like rings without the gems whoever in the face of men reads omo might well in these have recognised the m who would believe the odour of an apple begetting longing could consume them so and that of water without knowing how i still was wondering what so famished them for the occasion not yet manifest of their emaciation and sad squalor and lo from out the hollow of his head his eyes a shade turned on me and looked keenly then cried aloud what grace to me is this never should i have known him by his look but in his voice was evident to me that which his aspect had suppressed within it this spark within me wholly reenkindled my recognition of his altered face and i recalled the features of forese ah do not look at this dry leprosy entreated he which doth my skin discolour nor at default of flesh that i may have but tell me truth of thee and who are those two souls that yonder make for thee an escort do not delay in speaking unto me that face of thine which dead i once bewept gives me for weeping now no lesser grief i answered him beholding it so changed but tell me for gods sake what thus denudes you make me not speak while i am marvelling for ill speaks he whos full of other longings and he to me from the eternal council falls power into the water and the tree behind us left whereby i grow so thin all of this people who lamenting sing for following beyond measure appetite in hunger and thirst are here resanctified desire to eat and drink enkindles in us the scent that issues from the appletree and from the spray that sprinkles oer the verdure and not a single time alone this ground encompassing is refreshed our pain— i say our pain and ought to say our solace— for the same wish doth lead us to the tree which led the christ rejoicing to say eli when with his veins he liberated us and i to him forese from that day when for a better life thou changedst worlds up to this time five years have not rolled round if sooner were the power exhausted in thee of sinning more than thee the hour surprised of that good sorrow which to god reweds us how hast thou come up hitherward already i thought to find thee down there underneath where time for time doth restitution make and he to me thus speedily has led me to drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments my nella with her overflowing tears she with her prayers devout and with her sighs has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits and from the other circles set me free so much more dear and pleasing is to god my little widow whom so much i loved as in good works she is the more alone for the barbagia of sardinia by far more modest in its women is than the barbagia i have left her in o brother sweet what wilt thou have me say a future time is in my sight already to which this hour will not be very old when from the pulpit shall be interdicted to the unblushing womankind of florence to go about displaying breast and paps what savages were eer what saracens who stood in need to make them covered go of spiritual or other discipline but if the shameless women were assured of what swift heaven prepares for them already wide open would they have their mouths to howl for if my foresight here deceive me not they shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby o brother now no longer hide thee from me see that not only i but all these people are gazing there where thou dost veil the sun whence i to him if thou bring back to mind what thou with me hast been and i with thee the present memory will be grievous still out of that life he turned me back who goes in front of me two days agone when round the sister of him yonder showed herself and to the sun i pointed through the deep night of the truly dead has this one led me with this true flesh that follows after him thence his encouragements have led me up ascending and still circling round the mount that you doth straighten whom the world made crooked he says that he will bear me company till i shall be where beatrice will be there it behoves me to remain without him this is virgilius who thus says to me and him i pointed at the other is that shade for whom just now shook every slope your realm that from itself discharges him chapter buonagiunta da lucca pope martin iv and others in quiry into the state of poetry nor speech the going nor the going that slackened but talking we went bravely on even as a vessel urged by a good wind and shadows that appeared things doubly dead from out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed wonder at me aware that i was living and i continuing my colloquy said peradventure he goes up more slowly than he would do for other peoples sake but tell me if thou knowest where is piccarda tell me if any one of note i see among this folk that gazes at me so my sister

resemblance by our dieting this pointing with his finger is buonagiunta buonagiunta of lucca and that face beyond him there more peaked than the others has held the holy church within his arms from tours was he and purges by his fasting bolsenas eels and the vernaccia wine he named me many others one by one and all contented seemed at being named so that for this i saw not one dark look i saw for hunger bite the empty air ubaldin dalla pila and boniface who with his crook had pastured many people i saw messer marchese who had leisure once at forli for drinking with less dryness and he was one who neer felt satisfied but as he does who scans and then doth prize one more than others did i him of lucca who seemed to take most cognizance of me he murmured and i know not what gentucca from that place heard i where he felt the wound of justice that doth macerate them so o soul i said that seemest so desirous to speak with me do so that i may hear thee and with thy speech appease thyself and me a maid is born and wears not yet the veil began he who to thee shall pleasant make my city howsoever men may blame it thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision if by my murmuring thou hast been deceived true things hereafter will declare it to thee but say if him i here behold who forth evoked the newinvented rhymes beginning ladies that have intelligence of love and i to him one am i who whenever love doth inspire me note and in that measure which he within me dictates singing go o brother now i see he said the knot which me the notary and guittone held short of the sweet new style that now i hear i do perceive full clearly how your pens go closely following after him who dictates which with our own forsooth came not to pass and he who sets himself to go beyond no difference sees from one style to another and as if satisfied he held his peace even as the birds that winter towrds the nile sometimes into a phalanx form themselves then fly in greater haste and go in file in such wise all the people who were there turning their faces hurried on their steps both by their leanness and their wishes light and as a man who weary is with trotting lets his companions onward go and walks until he vents the panting of his chest so did forese let the holy flock pass by and came with me behind it saying when will it be that i again shall see thee how long i answered i may live i know not yet my return will not so speedy be but i shall sooner in desire arrive because the place where i was set to live from day to day of good is more depleted and unto dismal ruin seems ordained now go he said for him most guilty of it at a beasts tail behold i dragged along towards the valley where is no repentance faster at every step the beast is going increasing evermore until it smites him and leaves the body vilely mutilated not long those wheels shall turn and he uplifted his eyes to heaven ere shall be clear to thee that which my speech no farther can declare now stay behind because the time so precious is in this kingdom that i lose too much by coming onward thus abreast with thee as sometimes issues forth upon a gallop a cavalier from out a troop that ride and seeks the honour of the first encounter so he with greater strides departed from us and on the road remained i with those two who were such mighty marshals of the world and when before us he had gone so far mine eyes became to him such pursuivants as was my understanding to his words appeared to me with laden and living boughs another appletree and not far distant from having but just then turned thitherward people i saw beneath it lift their hands and cry i know not what towards the leaves like little children eager and deluded who pray and he they pray to doth not answer but to make very keen their appetite holds their desire aloft and hides it not then they departed as if undeceived and now we came unto the mighty tree which prayers and tears so manifold refuses pass farther onward without drawing near the tree of which eve ate is higher up and out of that one has this tree been raised thus said i know not who among the branches whereat virgilius statius and myself went crowding forward on the side that rises be mindful said he of the accursed ones formed of the cloudrack who inebriate combated theseus with their double breasts and of the jews who showed them soft in drinking whence gideon would not have them for companions when he towrds midian the hills descended thus closely pressed to one of the two borders on passed we hearing sins of gluttony followed forsooth by miserable gains then set at large upon the lonely road a thousand steps and more we onward went in contemplation each without a word what go ye thinking thus ye three alone said suddenly a voice whereat i started as terrified and timid beasts are wont i raised my head to see who this might be and never in a furnace was there seen metals or glass so lucent and so red as one i saw who said if it may please you to mount aloft here it behoves you turn this way goes he who goeth after peace his aspect had bereft me of my sight so that i turned me back unto my teachers like one who goeth as his hearing guides him and as the harbinger of early dawn the air of may doth move and breathe out fragrance impregnate all with herbage and with flowers so did i feel a breeze strike in the midst my front and felt the moving of the plumes that breathed around an odour of ambrosia and heard it said blessed are they whom grace so much illumines that the love of taste excites not in their breasts too great desire hungering at all times so far as is just chapter discourse of statius on generation the seventh circle the wanton now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked because the sun had his meridian circle to taurus left and night to scorpio wherefore as doth a man who tarries not but goes his way whateer to him appear if of necessity the sting transfix him in this wise did we enter through the gap taking the stairway one before the other which by its narrowness divides the climbers and as the little stork that lifts its wing with a desire to fly and does not venture to leave the nest and lets it downward droop even such was i with the desire of asking kindled and quenched unto the motion coming he makes who doth address himself to speak not for our pace though rapid

followeth the fire whereer it shifts after the spirit followeth its new form since afterwards it takes from this its semblance it is called shade and thence it organizes thereafter every sense even to the sight thence is it that we speak and thence we laugh thence is it that we form the tears and sighs that on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard according as impress us our desires and other affections so the shade is shaped and this is cause of what thou wonderest at and now unto the last of all the circles had we arrived and to the right hand turned and were attentive to another care there the embankment shoots forth flames of fire and upward doth the cornice breathe a blast that drives them back and from itself sequesters hence we must needs go on the open side and one by one and i did fear the fire on this side and on that the falling down my leader said along this place one ought to keep upon the eyes a tightened rein seeing that one so easily might err summae deus clementiae in the bosom of the great burning chanted then i heard which made me no less eager to turn round and spirits saw i walking through the flame wherefore i looked to my own steps and theirs apportioning my sight from time to time after the close which to that hymn is made aloud they shouted virum non cognosco then recommenced the hymn with voices low this also ended cried they to the wood diana ran and drove forth helice therefrom who had of venus felt the poison then to their song returned they then the wives they shouted and the husbands who were chaste as virtue and the marriage vow imposes and i believe that them this mode suffices for all the time the fire is burning them with such care is it needful and such food that the last wound of all should be closed up chapter sodomites guido guinicelli and arnaldo daniello while on the brink thus one before the other we went upon our way oft the good master said take thou heed suffice it that i warn thee on the right shoulder smote me now the sun that raying out already the whole west changed from its azure aspect into white and with my shadow did i make the flame appear more red and even to such a sign shades saw i many as they went give heed this was the cause that gave them a beginning to speak of me and to themselves began they to say that seems not a factitious body then towards me as far as they could come came certain of them always with regard not to step forth where they would not be burned o thou who goest not from being slower but reverent perhaps behind the others answer me who in

unto the sun as if thou hadst not entered as yet into the net of death thus one of them addressed me and i straight should have revealed myself were i not bent on other novelty that then appeared for through the middle of the burning road there came a people face to face with these which held me in suspense with gazing at them there see i hastening upon either side each of the shades and kissing one another without a pause content with brief salute thus in the middle of their brown battalions muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another perchance to spy their journey or their fortune no sooner is

sadness of lycurgus two sons became their mother rebeholding such i became but rise not to such height the moment i heard name himself the father of me and of my betters who had ever practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love and without speech and hearing thoughtfully for a long time i went beholding him nor for the fire did i approach him nearer when i was fed with looking utterly myself i offered ready for his service with affirmation that compels belief and he to me thou leavest footprints such in me from what i hear and so distinct lethe cannot efface them nor make dim but if thy

rachel arrival at the terrestrial paradise as when he vibrates forth his earliest rays in regions where his maker shed his blood the ebro falling under lofty libra and waters in the ganges burnt with

than our own then no one farther goes souls sanctified if first the fire bite not within it enter and be not deaf unto the song beyond when we were close beside him thus he said wherefore een such became i when i heard him as he is who is put into the grave upon my clasped hands i straightened me scanning the fire and vividly recalling the human bodies i had once seen burned towards me turned themselves my good conductors and unto me virgilius said my son here may indeed be torment but not death remember thee remember and if i on geryon have safely guided thee what shall i do now i am

seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn somewhat disturbed he said now look thou son twixt beatrice and thee there is this wall as at the name of thisbe oped his lids the dying pyramus and gazed upon her what time the mulberry became vermilion even thus my obduracy being softened i turned to my wise guide hearing the name that in my memory evermore is welling whereat he wagged his head and said how now shall we stay on this side then smiled as one does at a child whos vanquished by an apple then into the fire in front of me he entered beseeching statius to come after me who a long way before divided us when i was in it into molten glass i would have cast me to refresh myself so without measure was the burning there and my sweet father to encourage me discoursing still of beatrice went on saying her eyes i seem to see already a voice that on the other side was singing directed us and we attent alone on that came forth where the ascent began venite benedicti patris mei sounded within a splendour which was there such it oercame me and i could not look the sun departs it added and night cometh tarry ye not but onward urge your steps so long as yet the west becomes not dark straight forward through the rock the path ascended in such a way that i cut off the rays before me of the sun that now was low and of few stairs we yet had made assay ere by the vanished shadow the suns setting behind us we perceived i and my sages and ere in all its parts immeasurable the horizon of one aspect had become and night her boundless dispensation held each of us of a stair had made his bed because the nature of the mount took from us the power of climbing more than the delight even as in ruminating passive grow the goats who have been swift and venturesome upon the mountaintops ere they were fed hushed in the shadow while the sun is hot watched by the herdsman who upon his staff is leaning and in leaning tendeth them and as the shepherd lodging out of doors passes the night beside his quiet flock watching that no wild beast may scatter it such at that hour were we all three of us i like the goat and like the herdsmen they begirt on this side and on that by rocks little could there be seen of things without but through that little i beheld the stars more luminous and larger than their wont thus ruminating and beholding these sleep seized upon me—sleep that oftentimes before a deed is done has tidings of it it was the hour i think when from the east first on the mountain citherea beamed who with the fire of love seems always burning youthful and beautiful in dreams methought i saw a lady walking in a meadow gathering flowers and singing she was saying know whosoever may my name demand that i am leah and go moving round my beauteous hands to make myself a garland to please me at the mirror here i deck me but never does my sister rachel leave her lookingglass and sitteth all day long to see her beauteous eyes as eager is she as i am to adorn me with my hands her seeing and me doing satisfies and now before the antelucan splendours that unto pilgrims the more grateful rise as homereturning less remote they lodge the darkness fled away on every side and slumber with it whereupon i rose seeing already the great masters risen that apple sweet which through so many branches the care of mortals goeth in pursuit of today shall put in peace thy hungerings speaking to me virgilius of such words as these made use and never were there guerdons that could in pleasantness compare with these such longing upon longing came upon me to be above that at each step thereafter for flight i felt in me the pinions growing when underneath us was the stairway all run oer and we were on the highest step virgilius fastened upon me his eyes and said the temporal fire and the eternal son thou hast seen and to a place art come where of myself no farther i discern by intellect and art i here have brought thee take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou behold the sun that shines upon thy forehead behold the grass the flowerets and the shrubs which of itself alone this land produces until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes which weeping caused me to come unto thee thou canst sit down and thou canst walk among them expect no more or word or sign from me free and upright and sound is thy freewill and error were it not to do its bidding thee oer thyself i therefore crown and mitre chapter the river lethe matilda the nature of the terrestrial paradise eager already to search in and round the heavenly forest dense and livinggreen which tempered to the eyes the newborn day withouten more delay i left the bank taking the level country slowly slowly over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance a softlybreathing air that no mutation had in itself upon the forehead smote me no heavier blow than of a gentle wind whereat the branches lightly tremulous did all of them bow downward toward that side where its first shadow casts the holy mountain yet not from their upright direction swayed so that the little birds upon their tops should leave the practice of each art of theirs but with full ravishment the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of leaves that ever bore a burden to their rhymes such as from branch to branch goes gathering on through the pine forest on the shore of chiassi when eolus unlooses the sirocco already my slow steps had carried me into the ancient wood so far that i could not perceive where i had entered it and lo my further course a stream cut off which towrd the left hand with its little waves bent down the grass that on its margin sprang all waters that on earth most limpid are would seem to have within themselves some mixture compared with that which nothing doth conceal although it moves on with a brown brown current under the shade perpetual that never ray of the sun lets in nor of the moon with feet i stayed and with mine eyes i passed beyond the rivulet to look upon the great variety of the fresh may and there appeared to me even as appears suddenly something that doth turn aside through very wonder every other thought a lady all alone who went along singing and culling floweret after floweret with which her pathway was all painted over ah beauteous lady who in rays of love dost warm thyself if i may trust to looks which the hearts witnesses are wont to be may the desire come unto thee to draw near to this rivers bank i said to her so much that i might hear what thou art singing thou makest me remember where and what proserpina that moment was when lost her mother her and she herself the spring as turns herself with feet together pressed and to the ground a lady who is dancing and hardly puts one foot before the other on the vermilion and the yellow flowerets she turned towards me not in other wise than maiden who her modest eyes casts down and my entreaties made to be content so near approaching that the dulcet sound came unto me together with its meaning as soon as she was where the grasses are bathed by the waters of the beauteous river to lift her eyes she granted me the boon i do not think there shone so great a light under the lids of venus when transfixed by her own son beyond his usual custom erect upon the other bank she smiled bearing full many colours in her hands which that high land produces without seed apart three paces did the river make us but hellespont where xerxes passed across a curb still to all human arrogance more hatred from leander did not suffer for rolling between sestos and abydos than that from me because it oped not then ye are newcomers and because i smile began she peradventure in this place elect to human nature for its nest some apprehension keeps you marvelling but the psalm delectasti giveth light which has the power to uncloud your intellect and thou who foremost art and didst entreat me speak if thou wouldst hear more for i came ready to all thy questionings as far as needful the water said i and the forests sound are combating within me my new faith in something which i heard opposed to this whence she i will relate how from its cause proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder and purge away the cloud that smites upon thee the good supreme sole in itself delighting created man good and this goodly place gave him as hansel of eternal peace by his default short while he sojourned here by his default to weeping and to toil he changed his innocent laughter and sweet play that the disturbance which below is made by exhalations of the land and water which far as may be follow after heat might not upon mankind wage any war this mount ascended towrds the heaven so high and is exempt from there where it is locked now since the universal atmosphere turns in a circuit with the primal motion unless the circle is broken on some side upon this height that all is disengaged in living ether doth this motion strike and make the forest sound for it is dense and so much power the stricken plant possesses that with its virtue it impregns the air and this revolving scatters it around and yonder earth according as tis worthy in self or in its clime conceives and bears of divers qualities the divers trees it should not seem a marvel then on earth this being heard whenever any plant without seed manifest there taketh root and thou must know this holy tableland in which thou art is full of every seed and fruit has in it never gathered there the water which thou seest springs not from vein restored by vapour that the cold condenses like to a stream that gains or loses breath but issues from a fountain safe and certain which by the will of god as much regains as it discharges open on two sides upon this side with virtue it descends which takes away all memory of sin on that of every good deed done restores it here lethe as upon the other side eunoe it is called and worketh not if first on either side it be not tasted this every other savour doth transcend and notwithstanding slaked so far may be thy thirst that i reveal to thee no more ill give thee a corollary still in grace nor think my speech will be to thee less dear if it spread out beyond my promise to thee those who in ancient times have feigned in song the age of gold and its felicity dreamed of this place perhaps upon parnassus here was the human race in innocence here evermore was spring and every fruit this is the nectar of which each one speaks then backward did i turn me wholly round unto my poets and saw that with a smile they had been listening to these closing words then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes chapter the triumph of the church singing like unto an enamoured lady she with the ending of her words continued beati quorum tecta sunt peccata and even as nymphs that wandered all alone among the sylvan shadows sedulous one to avoid and one to see the sun she then against the stream moved onward going along the bank and i abreast of her her little steps with little steps attending between her steps and mine were not a hundred when equally the margins gave a turn in such a way that to the east i faced nor even thus our way continued far before the lady wholly turned herself unto me saying brother look and listen and lo a sudden lustre ran across on every side athwart the spacious forest such that it made me doubt if it were lightning but since the lightning ceases as it comes and that continuing brightened more and more within my thought i said what thing is this and a delicious melody there ran along the luminous air whence holy zeal made me rebuke the hardihood of eve for there where earth and heaven obedient were the woman only and but just created could not endure to stay neath any veil underneath which had she devoutly stayed i sooner should have tasted those delights ineffable and for a longer time while mid such manifold firstfruits i walked of the eternal pleasure all enrapt and still solicitous of more delights in front of us like an enkindled fire became the air beneath the verdant boughs and the sweet sound as singing now was heard o virgins sacrosanct if ever hunger vigils or cold for you i have endured the occasion spurs me their reward to claim now helicon must needs pour forth for me and with her choir urania must assist me to put in verse things difficult to think a little farther on seven trees of gold in semblance the long space still intervening between ourselves and them did counterfeit but when i had approached so near to them the common object which the sense deceives lost not by distance any of its marks the faculty that lends discourse to reason did apprehend that they were candlesticks and in the voices of the song hosanna above them flamed the harness beautiful far brighter than the moon in the serene of midnight at the middle of her month i turned me round with admiration filled to good virgilius and he answered me with visage no less full of wonderment then back i turned my face to those high things which moved themselves towards us so sedately they had been distanced by newwedded brides the lady chid me why dost thou burn only so with affection for the living lights and dost not look at what comes after them then saw i people as behind their leaders coming behind them garmented in white and such a whiteness never was on earth the water on my left flank was resplendent and back to me reflected my left side een as a mirror if i looked therein when i upon my margin had such post that nothing but the stream divided us better to see i gave my steps repose and i beheld the flamelets onward go leaving behind themselves the air depicted and they of trailing pennons had the semblance so that it overhead remained distinct with sevenfold lists all of them of the colours whence the suns bow is made and delias girdle these standards to the rearward longer were than was my sight and as it seemed to me ten paces were the outermost apart under so fair a heaven as i describe the four and twenty elders two by two came on incoronate with flowerdeluce they all of them were singing blessed thou among the daughters of adam art and blessed for evermore shall be thy loveliness after the flowers and other tender grasses in front of me upon the other margin were disencumbered of that race elect even as in heaven star followeth after star there came close after them four animals incoronate each one with verdant leaf plumed with six wings was every one of them the plumage full of eyes the eyes of argus if they were living would be such as these reader to trace their forms no more i waste my rhymes for other spendings press me so that i in this cannot be prodigal but read ezekiel who depicteth them as he beheld them from the region cold coming with cloud with whirlwind and with fire and such as thou shalt find them in his pages such were they here saving that in their plumage john is with me and differeth from him the interval between these four contained a chariot triumphal on two wheels which by a griffins neck came drawn along and upward he extended both his wings between the middle list and three and three so that he injured none by cleaving it so high they rose that they were lost to sight his limbs were gold so far as he was bird and white the others with vermilion mingled not only rome with no such splendid car eer gladdened africanus or augustus but poor to it that of the sun would be— that of the sun which swerving was burnt up at the importunate orison of earth when jove was so mysteriously just three maidens at the right wheel in a circle came onward dancing one so very red that in the fire she hardly had been noted the second was as if her flesh and bones had all been fashioned out of emerald the third appeared as snow but newly fallen and now they seemed conducted by the white now by the red and from the song of her the others took their step or slow or swift upon the left hand four made holiday vested in purple following the measure of one of them with three eyes m her head in rear of all the group here treated of two old men i beheld unlike in habit but like in gait each dignified and grave one showed himself as one of the disciples of that supreme hippocrates whom nature made for the animals she holds most dear contrary care the other manifested with sword so shining and so sharp it caused terror to me on this side of the river thereafter four i saw of humble aspect and behind all an aged man alone walking in sleep with countenance acute and like the foremost company these seven were habited yet of the flowerdeluce no garland round about the head they wore but of the rose and other flowers vermilion at little distance would the sight have sworn that all were in a flame above their brows and when the car was opposite to me thunder was heard and all that folk august seemed to have further progress interdicted there with the vanward ensigns standing still chapter virgils departure beatrice dantes shame when the septentrion of the highest heaven which never either setting knew or rising nor veil of other cloud than that of sin and which made every one therein aware of his own duty as the lower makes whoever turns the helm to come to port motionless halted the veracious people that came at first between it and the griffin turned themselves to the car as to their peace and one of them as if by heaven commissioned singing veni sponsa de libano shouted three times and all the others after even as the blessed at the final summons shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern uplifting light the reinvested flesh so upon that celestial chariot a hundred rose ad vocem tanti senis ministers and messengers of life eternal they all were saying benedictus qui venis and scattering flowers above and round about manibus o date lilia plenis ere now have i beheld as day began the eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose and the other heaven with fair serene adorned and the suns face uprising overshadowed so that by tempering influence of vapours for a long interval the eye sustained it thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers which from those hands angelical ascended and downward fell again inside and out over her snowwhite veil with olive cinct appeared a lady under a green mantle vested in colour of the living flame and my own spirit that already now so long a time had been that in her presence trembling with awe it had not stood abashed without more knowledge having by mine eyes through occult virtue that from her proceeded of ancient love the mighty influence felt as soon as on my vision smote the power sublime that had already pierced me through ere from my boyhood i had yet come forth to the left hand i turned with that reliance with which the little child runs to his mother when he has fear or when he is afflicted to say unto virgilius not a drachm of blood remains in me that does not tremble i know the traces of the ancient flame but us virgilius of himself deprived had left virgilius sweetest of all fathers virgilius to whom i for safety gave me nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother availed my cheeks now purified from dew that weeping they should not again be darkened dante because virgilius has departed do not weep yet do not weep yet awhile for by another sword thou needst must weep een as an admiral who on poop and prow comes to behold the people that are working in other ships and cheers them to welldoing upon the left hand border of the car when at the sound i turned of my own name which of necessity is here recorded i saw the lady who erewhile appeared veiled underneath the angelic festival direct her eyes to me across the river although the veil that from her head descended encircled with the foliage of minerva did not permit her to appear distinctly in attitude still royally majestic continued she like unto one who speaks and keeps his warmest utterance in reserve look at me well in sooth im beatrice how didst thou deign to come unto the mountain didst thou not know that man is happy here mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain but seeing myself therein i sought the grass so great a shame did weigh my forehead down as to the son the mother seems superb so she appeared to me for somewhat bitter tasteth the savour of severe compassion silent became she and the angels sang suddenly in te domine speravi but beyond pedes meos did not pass even as the snow among the living rafters upon the back of italy congeals blown on and drifted by sclavonian winds and then dissolving trickles through itself wheneer the land that loses shadow breathes so that it seems a fire that melts a taper een thus was i without a tear or sigh before the song of those who sing for ever after the music of the eternal spheres but when i heard in their sweet melodies compassion for me more than had they said o wherefore lady dost thou thus upbraid him the ice that was about my heart congealed to air and water changed and in my anguish through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast she on the righthand border of the car still firmly standing to those holy beings thus her discourse directed afterwards ye keep your watch in the eternal day so that nor night nor sleep can steal from you one step the ages make upon their path therefore my answer is with greater care that he may hear me who is weeping yonder so that the sin and dole be of one measure not only by the work of those great wheels that destine every seed unto some end according as the stars are in conjunction but by the largess of celestial graces which have such lofty vapours for their rain that near to them our sight approaches not such had this man become in his new life potentially that every righteous habit would have made admirable proof in him but so much more malignant and more savage becomes the land untilled and with bad seed the more good earthly vigour it possesses some time did i sustain him with my look revealing unto him my youthful eyes i led him with me turned in the right way as soon as ever of my second age i was upon the threshold and changed life himself from me he took and gave to others when from the flesh to spirit i ascended and beauty and virtue were in me increased i was to him less dear and less delightful and into ways untrue he turned his steps pursuing the false images of good that never any promises fulfil nor prayer for inspiration me availed by means of which in dreams and otherwise i called him back so little did he heed them so low he fell that all appliances for his salvation were already short save showing him the people of perdition for this i visited the gates of death and unto him who so far up has led him

chapter reproaches of beatrice and confession of dante the passage of lethe the seven virtues the griffon o thou who art beyond the sacred river turning to me the point of her discourse that edgewise even had seemed to me so keen she recommenced continuing without pause say say if this be true to such a charge thy own confession needs must be conjoined my faculties were in so great confusion that the voice moved but sooner was extinct than by its organs it was set at large awhile she waited then she said what thinkest answer me for the mournful memories in thee not yet are by the waters injured confusion and dismay together mingled forced such a yes from out my mouth that sight was needful to the understanding of it even as a crossbow breaks when tis discharged too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow and with less force the arrow hits the mark so i gave way beneath that heavy burden outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs and the voice flagged upon its passage forth whence she to me in those desires of mine which led thee to the loving of that good beyond which there is nothing to aspire to what trenches lying traverse or what chains didst thou discover that of passing onward thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope and what allurements or what vantages upon the forehead of the others showed that thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them after the heaving of a bitter sigh hardly had i the voice to make response and with fatigue my lips did fashion it weeping i said the things that present were with their false pleasure turned aside my steps soon as your countenance concealed itself and she shouldst thou be silent or deny what thou confessest not less manifest would be thy fault by such a judge tis known but when from ones own cheeks comes bursting forth the accusal of the sin in our tribunal against the edge the wheel doth turn itself but still that thou mayst feel a greater shame for thy transgression and another time hearing the sirens thou mayst be more strong cast down the seed of weeping and attend so shalt thou hear how in an opposite way my buried flesh should have directed thee never to thee presented art or nature pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein i was enclosed which scattered are in earth and if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee by reason of my death what mortal thing should then have drawn thee into its desire thou oughtest verily at the first shaft of things fallacious to have risen up to follow me who was no longer such thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward to wait for further blows or little girl or other vanity of such brief use the callow birdlet waits for two or three but to the eyes of those already fledged in vain the net is spread or shaft is shot even as children silent in their shame stand listening with their eyes upon the ground and conscious of their fault and penitent so was i standing and she said if thou in hearing sufferest pain lift up thy beard and thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing with less resistance is a robust holm uprooted either by a native wind or else by that from regions of iarbas than i upraised at her command my chin and when she by the beard the face demanded well i perceived the venom of her meaning and as my countenance was lifted up mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful had rested from the strewing of the flowers and still but little reassured mine eyes saw beatrice turned round towards the monster that is one person only in two natures beneath her veil beyond the margent green she seemed to me far more her ancient self to excel than others here when she was here so pricked me then the thorn of penitence that of all other things the one which turned me most to its love became the most my foe such selfconviction stung me at the heart oerpowered i fell and what i then became she knoweth who had furnished me the cause then when the heart restored my outward sense the lady i had found alone above me i saw and she was saying hold me hold me up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me and dragging me behind her she was moving upon the water lightly as a shuttle when i was near unto the blessed shore asperges me i heard so sweetly sung remember it i cannot much less write it the beautiful lady opened wide her arms embraced my head and plunged me underneath where i was forced to swallow of the water then forth she drew me and all dripping brought into the dance of the four beautiful and each one with her arm did cover me we here are nymphs and in the heaven are stars ere beatrice descended to the world we as her handmaids were appointed her well lead thee to her eyes but for the pleasant light that within them is shall sharpen thine the three beyond who more profoundly look thus singing they began and afterwards unto the griffins breast they led me with them where beatrice was standing turned towards us see that thou dost not spare thine eyes they said before the emeralds have we stationed thee whence love aforetime drew for thee his weapons a thousand longings hotter than the flame fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent that still upon the griffin steadfast stayed as in a glass the sun not otherwise within them was the twofold monster shining now with the one now with the other nature think reader if within myself i marvelled when i beheld the thing itself stand still and in its image it transformed itself while with amazement filled and jubilant my soul was tasting of the food that while it satisfies us makes us hunger for it themselves revealing of the highest rank in bearing did the other three advance singing to their angelic saraband turn beatrice o turn thy holy eyes such was their song unto thy faithful one who has to see thee taen so many steps in grace do us the grace that thou unveil thy face to him so that he may discern the second beauty which thou dost conceal o splendour of the living light eternal who underneath the shadow of parnassus has grown so pale or drunk so at its cistern he would not seem to have his mind encumbered striving to paint thee as thou didst appear where the harmonious heaven oershadowed thee when in the open air thou didst unveil chapter the tree of knowledge allegory of the chariot so steadfast and attentive were mine eyes in satisfying their decennial thirst that all my other senses were extinct and upon this side and on that they had walls of indifference so the holy smile drew them unto itself with the old net when forcibly my sight was turned away towards my left hand by those goddesses because i heard from them a too intently and that condition of the sight which is in eyes but lately smitten by the sun bereft me of my vision some short while but to the less when sight reshaped itself i say the less in reference to the greater splendour from which perforce i had withdrawn i saw upon its right wing wheeled about the glorious host returning with the sun and with the sevenfold flames upon their faces as underneath its shields to save itself a squadron turns and with its banner wheels before the whole thereof can change its front that soldiery of the celestial kingdom which marched in the advance had wholly passed us before the chariot had turned its pole then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves and the griffin moved his burden benedight but so that not a feather of him fluttered the lady fair who drew me through the ford followed with statius and myself the wheel which made its orbit with the lesser arc so passing through the lofty forest vacant by fault of her who in the serpent trusted angelic music made our steps keep time perchance as great a space had in three flights an arrow loosened from the string oerpassed as we had moved when beatrice descended i heard them murmur altogether adam then circled they about a tree despoiled of blooms and other leafage on each bough its tresses which so much the more dilate as higher they ascend had been by indians among their forests marvelled at for height blessed art thou o griffin who dost not pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste since appetite by this was turned to evil after this fashion round the tree robust the others shouted and the twofold creature thus is preserved the seed of all the just and turning to the pole which he had dragged he drew it close beneath the widowed bough and what was of it unto it left bound in the same manner as our trees when downward falls the great light with that together mingled which after the celestial lasca shines

that had erewhile its boughs so desolate i never heard nor here below is sung the hymn which afterward that people sang nor did i bear the melody throughout had i the power to paint how fell asleep those eyes compassionless of syrinx hearing those eyes to which more watching cost so dear even as a painter who from model paints i would portray how i was lulled asleep he may who well can picture

greedy for its fruit and keeps perpetual bridals in the heaven peter and john and james conducted were and overcome recovered at the word by which still greater slumbers have been broken and saw their school diminished by the loss not only of elias but of moses and the apparel of their master changed so i revived and saw that piteous one above me standing who had been conductress aforetime of my steps beside the river and all in doubt i said wheres beatrice and she behold her seated underneath the leafage new upon the root of it behold the company that circles her the rest behind the griffin are ascending with more melodious song and more profound and if her speech were more diffuse i know not because already in my sight was she who from the hearing of aught else had shut me alone she sat

are secure from aquilon and auster short while shalt thou be here a forester and thou shalt be with me for evermore a citizen of that rome where christ is roman therefore for that worlds good which

rending away the bark as well as blossoms and the foliage new and he with all his might the chariot smote whereat it reeled like vessel in a tempest tossed by the waves now starboard and now larboard thereafter saw i leap into the body of the triumphal vehicle a fox that seemed unfed with any wholesome food but for his hideous sins upbraiding him my lady put him to as swift a flight as such a fleshless skeleton could bear then by the way that it before had come into the chariots chest i saw the eagle descend and leave it feathered with his plumes and such as issues from a heart that mourns a voice from heaven there issued and it said my little bark how badly art thou freighted methought then that the earth did yawn between both wheels and i saw rise from it a dragon who through the chariot upward fixed his tail and as a wasp that draweth back its sting drawing unto himself his tail malign drew out the floor and went his way rejoicing that which remained behind even as with grass a fertile region with the feathers offered perhaps with pure intention and benign reclothed itself and with them were reclothed the pole and both the wheels so speedily a sigh doth longer keep the lips apart transfigured thus the holy edifice thrust forward heads upon the parts of it three on the pole and one at either corner the first were horned like oxen but the four had but a single horn upon the forehead a monster such had never yet been seen firm as a rock upon a mountain high seated upon it there appeared to me a shameless whore with eyes swift glancing round and as if not to have her taken from him upright beside her i beheld a giant and ever and anon they kissed each other but because she her wanton roving eye turned upon me her angry paramour did scourge her from her head unto her feet then full of jealousy and fierce with wrath he loosed the monster and across the forest dragged it so far he made of that alone a shield unto the whore and the strange beast chapter lament over the state of the church final reproaches of beatrice the river eunoe deus venerunt gentes alternating now three now four melodious psalmody the maidens in the midst of tears began and beatrice compassionate and sighing listened to them with such a countenance that scarce more changed was mary at the cross but when the other virgins place had given for her to speak uprisen to her feet with colour as of fire she made response modicum et non videbitis me et iterum my sisters predilect modicum et vos videbitis me then all the seven in front of her she placed and after her by beckoning only moved me and the lady and the sage who stayed so she moved onward and i do not think that her tenth step was placed upon the ground when with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote and with a tranquil aspect come more quickly to me she said that if i speak with thee to listen to me thou mayst be well placed as soon as i was with her as i should be she said to me why brother dost thou not

fixed mine eyes beyond our wont there much is lawful which is here unlawful unto our powers by virtue of the place made for the human species as its own not long i bore it nor so little while but i beheld it sparkle round about like iron that comes molten from the fire and suddenly it seemed that day to day was added as if he who has the power had with another sun the heaven adorned with eyes upon the everlasting wheels stood beatrice all intent and i on her fixing my vision from above removed such at her aspect inwardly became as glaucus tasting of the herb that made him peer of the other gods beneath the sea to represent transhumanise in words impossible were the example then suffice him for whom grace the experience reserves if i was merely what of me thou newly createdst love who governest the heaven thou knowest who didst lift me with thy light when now the wheel which thou dost make eternal desiring thee made me attentive to it by harmony thou dost modulate and measure then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled by the suns flame that neither rain nor river eer made a lake so widely spread abroad the newness of the sound and the great light kindled in me a longing for their cause never before with such acuteness felt whence she who saw me as i saw myself to quiet in me my perturbed mind opened her mouth ere i did mine to ask and she began thou makest thyself so dull with false imagining that thou seest not what thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off thou art not upon earth as thou believest but lightning fleeing its appropriate site neer ran as thou who thitherward returnest if of my former doubt i was divested by these brief little words more smiled than spoken i in a new one was the more ensnared and said already did i rest content from great amazement but am now amazed in what way i transcend these bodies light whereupon she after a pitying sigh her eyes directed towrds me with that look a mother casts on a delirious child and she began all things whateer they be have order among themselves and this is form that makes the universe resemble god here do the higher creatures see the footprints of the eternal power which is the end

oftentimes the form accords not with the intention of the art because in answering is matter deaf so likewise from this course doth deviate sometimes the creature who the power possesses though thus impelled to swerve some other way in the same wise as one may see the fire fall from a cloud if the first impetus earthward is wrested by some false delight thou shouldst not wonder more if well i

tell that fabulous tale of cain somewhat she smiled and then if the opinion of mortals be erroneous she said whereer the key of sense doth not unlock certes the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee now forasmuch as following the senses thou seest that the reason has short wings but tell me what thou thinkst of it thyself and i what seems to us up here diverse is caused i think by bodies rare and dense and she right truly shalt thou see immersed in error thy belief if well thou hearest the argument that i shall make against it lights many the eighth sphere displays to you which in their quality and quantity may noted be of aspects different if this were caused by rare and dense alone one only virtue would there be in all or more or less diffused or equally virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits of formal principles and these save one of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed besides if rarity were of this dimness the cause thou askest either through and through this planet thus attenuate were of matter or else as in a body is apportioned the fat and lean so in like manner this would in its volume interchange the leaves were it the former in the suns eclipse it would be manifest by the shining through of light as through aught tenuous interfused this is not so hence we must scan the other and if it chance the other i demolish then falsified will thy opinion be but if this rarity go not through and through there needs must be a limit beyond which its contrary prevents the further passing and thence the foreign radiance is reflected even as a colour cometh

the being of whatever it contains the following heaven that has so many eyes divides this being by essences diverse distinguished from it and by it contained the other spheres by various differences all the distinctions which they have within them dispose unto their ends and their effects thus do these organs of the world proceed as thou perceivest now from grade to grade since from above they take and act beneath observe me well how through this place i come unto the truth thou wishest that hereafter thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford the power and motion of the holy spheres as from the artisan the hammers craft forth from the blessed motors must proceed the heaven which lights so manifold make fair from the intelligence profound which turns it the image takes and makes of it a seal and even as the soul within your dust through members different and accommodated to faculties diverse expands itself so likewise this intelligence diffuses its virtue multiplied among the stars itself revolving on its unity virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage make with the precious body that it quickens in which as life in you it is combined from the glad nature whence it is derived the mingled virtue through the body shines even as gladness through the living pupil from this proceeds whateer from light to light appeareth different not from dense and rare this is the formal

opposite to that which kindled love twixt man and fountain as soon as i became aware of them esteeming them as mirrored semblances to see of whom they were mine eyes i turned and nothing saw and once more turned them forward direct into the light of my sweet guide who smiling kindled in her holy eyes marvel thou not she said to me because i smile at this thy puerile conceit since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot but turns thee as tis wont on emptiness true substances are these which thou beholdest here relegate for breaking of some vow therefore speak with them listen and believe for the true light which giveth peace to them permits them not to turn from it their feet and i unto the shade that seemed most wishful to speak directed me and i began as one whom too great eagerness bewilders o wellcreated spirit who in the rays of life eternal dost the sweetness taste which being untasted neer is comprehended grateful twill be to me if thou content me both with thy name and with your destiny whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes our charity doth never shut the doors against a just desire except as one who wills that all her court be like herself i was a virgin sister in

blessed in the slowest sphere all our affections that alone inflamed are in the pleasure of the holy ghost rejoice at being of his order formed and this allotment which appears so low therefore is given us because our vows have been neglected and in some part void whence i to her in your miraculous aspects there shines i know not what of the divine which doth transform you from our first conceptions therefore i was not swift in my remembrance but what thou tellest me now aids me so that the refiguring is easier to me but tell me ye who in this place are happy are you desirous of a higher place to see more or to make yourselves more friends first with those other shades she smiled a little thereafter answered me so full of gladness she seemed to burn in the first fire of love brother our will is quieted by virtue of charity that makes us wish alone for what we have nor gives us thirst for more if to be more exalted we aspired discordant would our aspirations be unto the will of him who here secludes us which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles if being in charity is needful here and if thou lookest well into its nature nay tis essential to this blest existence to keep itself within the will divine whereby our very wishes are made one so that as we are station above station throughout this realm to all the realm tis pleasing as to the king who makes his will our will and his will is our peace this is the sea to which is moving onward whatsoever it doth create and all that nature makes then it was clear to me how everywhere in heaven is paradise although the grace of good supreme there rain not in one measure but as it comes to pass if one food sates and for another still remains the longing we ask for this and that decline with thanks een thus did i with gesture and with word to learn from her what was the web wherein she did not ply the shuttle to the end a perfect life and merit high inheaven a lady oer us said she by whose rule down in your world they vest and veil themselves that until death they may both watch and sleep beside that spouse who every vow accepts which charity conformeth to his pleasure to follow her in girlhood from the world i fled and in her habit shut myself and pledged me to the pathway of her sect then men accustomed unto evil more than unto good from the sweet cloister tore me god knows what afterward my life became this other splendour which to thee reveals itself on my right side and is enkindled with all the illumination of our sphere what of myself i say applies to her a nun was she and likewise from her head was taen the shadow of the sacred wimple but when she too was to the world returned against her wishes and against good usage of the hearts veil she never was divested of great costanza this is the effulgence who from the second wind of suabia brought forth the third and latest puissance thus unto me she spake and then began ave maria singing and in singing vanished as through deep water something heavy my sight that followed her as long a time as it was possible when it had lost her turned round unto the mark of more desire and wholly unto beatrice reverted but she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes that at the first my sight endured it not and this in questioning more backward made me chapter questionings of the soul and of broken vows between two

thee less venom has for its malevolence could never lead thee otherwhere from me that as unjust our justice should appear in eyes of mortals is an argument of faith and not of sin heretical but still that your perception may be able to thoroughly penetrate this verity as thou desirest i will satisfy thee if it be violence when he who suffers cooperates not with him who uses force these souls were not on that account excused for will is never quenched unless it will but operates as nature doth in fire if violence a thousand times distort it hence if it yieldeth more or less it seconds the force and these have done so having power of turning back unto the holy place if their will had been perfect like to that which lawrence fast upon his gridiron held and mutius made severe to his own hand it would have urged them back along the road whence they were dragged as soon as they were free but such a solid will is all too rare and by these words if thou hast gathered them as thou shouldst do the argument is refuted that would have still annoyed thee many times but now another passage runs across before thine eyes and such that by thyself thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary i have for certain put into thy mind that soul beatified could never lie for it is near the primal truth and then thou from piccarda mightst have heard costanza kept affection for the veil so that she seemeth here to contradict me many times brother has it come to pass that to escape from peril with reluctance that has been done it was not right to do een as alcmaeon who being by his father thereto entreated his own mother slew not to lose pity pitiless became at this point i desire thee to remember that force with will commingles and they cause that the offences cannot be excused will absolute consenteth not to evil but in so far consenteth as it fears if it refrain to fall into more harm hence when piccarda uses this expression she meaneth the will absolute and i the other so that both of us speak truth such was the flowing of the holy river that issued from the fount whence springs all truth this put to rest my wishes one and all o love of the first lover o divine said i forthwith whose speech inundates me and warms me so it more and more revives me my own affection is not so profound as to suffice in rendering grace for grace let him who sees and can thereto respond well i perceive that never sated is our intellect unless the truth illume it beyond which nothing true expands itself it rests therein as wild beast in his lair when it attains it and it can attain it if not then each desire would frustrate be therefore springs up in fashion of a shoot doubt at the foot of truth and this is nature which to the top from height to height impels us this doth invite me this assurance give me with reverence lady to inquire of you another truth which is obscure to me i wish to know if man can satisfy you for broken vows with other good deeds so that in your balance they will not be light beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes full of the sparks of love and so divine that overcome my power i turned my back and almost lost myself with eyes downcast chapter discourse of beatrice on vows and compensations ascent to the second heaven mercury spirits who for the love of fame achieved great deeds if in the heat of love i flame upon thee beyond the measure that on earth is seen so that the valour of thine eyes i vanquish marvel thou not thereat for this proceeds from perfect sight which as it apprehends to the good apprehended moves its feet well i perceive how is already shining into thine intellect the eternal light that only seen enkindles always love and if some other thing your love seduce tis nothing but a vestige of the same ill understood which there is shining through thou fain wouldst know if with another service for broken vow can such return be made as to secure the soul from further claim this canto thus did beatrice begin and as a man who breaks not off his speech continued thus her holy argument the greatest gift that in his largess god creating made and unto his own goodness nearest conformed and that which he doth prize most highly is the freedom of the will wherewith the creatures of intelligence both all and only were and are endowed now wilt thou see if thence thou reasonest the high worth of a vow if it he made so that when thou consentest god consents for closing between god and man the compact a sacrifice is of this treasure made such as i say and made by its own act what can be rendered then as compensation thinkst thou to make good use of what thoust offered with gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed now art thou certain of the greater point but because holy church in this dispenses which seems against the truth which i have shown thee behoves thee still to sit awhile at table because the solid food which thou hast taken requireth further aid for thy digestion open thy mind to that which i reveal and fix it there within for tis not knowledge the having heard without retaining it in the essence of this sacrifice two things convene together and the one is that of which tis made the other is the agreement this last for evermore is cancelled not unless complied with and concerning this with such precision has above been spoken therefore it was enjoined upon the hebrews to offer still though sometimes what was offered might be commuted as thou oughtst to know the other which is known to thee as matter may well indeed be such that one errs not if it for other matter be exchanged but let none shift the burden on his shoulder at his arbitrament without the turning both of the white and of the yellow key and every permutation deem as foolish if in the substitute the thing relinquished as the four is in six be not contained therefore whatever thing has so great weight in value that it drags down every balance cannot be satisfied with other spending let mortals never take a vow in jest be faithful and not blind in doing that as jephthah was in his first offering whom more beseemed to say i have done wrong than to do worse by keeping and as foolish thou the great leader of the greeks wilt find whence wept iphigenia her fair face and made for her both wise and simple weep who heard such kind of worship spoken of christians be ye more serious in your movements be ye not like a feather at each wind and think not every water washes you ye have the old and the new testament and the pastor of the church who guideth you let this suffice you unto your salvation if evil appetite cry aught else to you be ye as men and not as silly sheep so that the jew among you may not mock you be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon its mothers milk and frolicsome and simple combats at its own pleasure with itself thus beatrice to me even as i write it then all desireful turned herself again to that part where the world is most alive her silence and her change of countenance silence imposed upon my eager mind that had already in advance new questions and as an arrow that upon the mark strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become so did we speed into the second realm my lady there so joyful i beheld as into the brightness of that heaven she entered more luminous thereat the planet grew and if the star itself was changed and smiled what became i who by my nature am exceeding mutable in every guise as in a fishpond which is pure and tranquil the fishes draw to that which from without comes in such fashion that their food they deem it so i beheld more than a thousand splendours drawing towards us and in each was heard lo this is she who shall increase our love and as each one was coming unto us full of beatitude the shade was seen by the effulgence clear that issued from it think reader if what here is just beginning no farther should proceed how thou wouldst have an agonizing need of knowing more and of thyself thoult see how i from these was in desire of hearing their conditions as they unto mine eyes were manifest o thou wellborn unto whom grace concedes to see the thrones of the eternal triumph or ever yet the warfare be abandoned with light that through the whole of heaven is spread kindled are we and hence if thou desirest to know of us at thine own pleasure sate thee thus by some one among those holy spirits was spoken and by beatrice speak speak securely and believe them even as gods well i perceive how thou dost nest thyself in thine own light and drawest it from thine eyes because they coruscate when thou dost smile but know not who thou art nor why thou hast spirit august thy station in the sphere that veils itself to men in alien rays this said i in direction of the light which first had spoken to me whence it became by far more lucent than it was before even as the sun that doth conceal himself by too much light when heat has worn away the tempering influence of the vapours dense by greater rapture thus concealed itself in its own radiance the figure saintly and thus close close enfolded answered me in fashion as the following canto sings chapter justinian the roman eagle the empire romeo after that constantine the

mountains whence it issued first and under shadow of the sacred plumes it governed there the world from hand to hand and changing thus upon mine own alighted caesar i was and am justinian who by the will of primal love i feel took from the laws the useless and redundant and ere unto the work i was attent one nature to exist in christ not more believed and with such faith was i contented but blessed agapetus he who was the supreme pastor to the faith sincere pointed me out the way by words of his him i believed and what was his assertion i now see clearly even as thou seest each contradiction to be false and true as soon as with the church i moved my feet god in his grace it pleased with this high task to inspire me and i gave me wholly to it and to my belisarius i commended the arms to which was heavens right hand so joined it was a signal that i should repose now here to the first question terminates my answer but the character thereof constrains me to continue with a sequel in order that thou see with how great reason men move against the standard sacrosanct both who appropriate and who oppose it behold how great a power has made it worthy of reverence beginning from the hour when pallas died to give it sovereignty thou knowest it made in alba its abode three hundred years and upward till at last the three to three fought for it yet again thou knowest what it achieved from sabine wrong down to lucretias sorrow in seven kings oercoming round about the neighboring nations thou knowest what it achieved borne by the romans illustrious against brennus against pyrrhus against the other princes and confederates torquatus thence and quinctius who from locks unkempt was named decii and fabii received the fame i willingly embalm it struck to earth the pride of the arabians who following hannibal had passed across the alpine ridges po from which thou glidest beneath it triumphed while they yet were young pompey and scipio and to the hill beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed then near unto the time when heaven had willed to bring the whole world to its mood serene did caesar by the will of rome assume it what it achieved from var unto the rhine isere beheld and saone beheld the seine and every valley whence the rhone is filled what it achieved when it had left ravenna and leaped the rubicon was such a flight that neither tongue nor pen could follow it round towards spain it wheeled its legions then towards durazzo and pharsalia smote that to the calid nile was felt the pain antandros and the simois whence it started it saw again and there

adder sudden and black death with him it ran even to the red sea shore with him it placed the world in so great peace that unto janus was his temple closed but what the standard that has made me speak achieved before and after should achieve throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it becometh in appearance mean and dim if in the hand of the third caesar seen with eye unclouded and affection pure because the living justice that inspires me granted it in the hand of him i speak of the glory of doing vengeance for its wrath now here attend to what i answer thee later it ran with titus to do vengeance upon the vengeance of the ancient sin and when the tooth of lombardy had bitten the holy church then underneath its wings did charlemagne victorious succor her now hast thou power to judge

sight this nature when united to its maker such as created was sincere and good but by itself alone was banished forth from paradise because it turned aside out of the way of truth and of its life

likewise beheld i down the steps descending so many splendours that i thought each light that in the heaven appears was there diffused and as accordant with their natural custom the rooks together at the break of day bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold then some of them fly off without return others come back to where they started from and others wheeling round still keep at home such fashion it appeared to me was there within the sparkling that together came as soon as on a certain step it struck and that which nearest unto us remained became so clear that in my thought i said well i perceive the love thou showest me but she from whom i wait the how and when of speech and silence standeth still whence i against desire do well if i ask not she thereupon who saw my silentness

through the rest below sounds so devoutly thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight it answer made to me they sing not here for the same cause that beatrice has not smiled thus far adown the holy stairways steps have i descended but to give thee welcome with words and with the light that mantles me nor did more love cause me to be more ready for love as much and more up there is burning as doth the flaming manifest to thee but the high charity that makes us servants prompt to the counsel which controls the world allotteth here even as thou dost observe i see full well said i o sacred lamp how love unfettered in this court sufficeth to follow the eternal providence but this is what seems hard for me to see wherefore predestinate wast thou alone unto this office from among thy consorts no sooner had i come to the last word than of its middle made the light a centre whirling itself about like a swift millstone when answer made the love that was therein on me directed is a light divine piercing through this in which i am embosomed of which the virtue with my sight conjoined lifts me above myself so far i see the supreme essence from which this is drawn hence comes the joyfulness with which i flame for to my sight as far as it is clear the clearness of the flame i equal make but that soul in the heaven which is most pure that seraph which his eye on god most fixes could this demand of thine not satisfy because so deeply sinks in the abyss of the eternal statute what thou askest from all created sight it is cut off and to the mortal world when thou returnest this carry back that it may not presume longer towrd such a goal to move its feet the mind that shineth here on earth doth smoke from this observe how can it do below that which it cannot though the heaven assume it such limit did its words prescribe to me the question i relinquished and restricted myself to ask it humbly who it was between two shores of italy rise cliffs and not far distant from thy native place so high the thunders far below them sound and form a ridge that catria is called neath which is consecrate a hermitage wont to be dedicate to worship only thus unto me the third speech recommenced and then continuing it said therein unto gods service i became so steadfast that feeding only on the juice of olives lightly i passed away the heats and frosts contented in my thoughts contemplative that cloister used to render to these heavens abundantly and now is empty grown so that perforce it soon must be revealed i in that place was peter damiano and peter the sinner was i in the house of our lady on the adriatic shore little of mortal life remained to me when i was called and dragged forth to the hat which shifteth evermore from bad to worse came cephas and the mighty vessel came of the holy spirit meagre and barefooted taking the food of any hostelry now some one to support them on each side the modern shepherds need and some to lead them so heavy are they and to hold their trains they cover up their palfreys with their cloaks so that two beasts go underneath one skin o patience that dost tolerate so much at this voice saw i many little flames from step to step descending and revolving and every revolution made them fairer round about this one came they and stood still and a cry uttered of so loud a sound it here could find no parallel nor i distinguished it the thunder so oercame me chapter st benedict his lamentation over the corruption of monks the eighth heaven the fixed stars oppressed with stupor i unto my guide turned like a little child who always runs for refuge there where he confideth most and she even as a mother who straightway gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy with voice whose wont it is to reassure him said to me knowest thou not thou art in heaven and knowest thou not that heaven is holy all and what is done here cometh from good zeal after what wise the singing would have changed thee and i by smiling thou canst now imagine since that the cry has startled thee so much in which if thou hadst understood its prayers already would be known to thee the vengeance which thou shalt look upon before thou diest the sword above here smiteth not in haste nor tardily howeer it seem to him who fearing or desiring waits for it but turn thee round towards the others now for very illustrious spirits shalt thou see if thou thy sight directest as i say as it seemed good to her mine eyes i turned and saw a hundred spherules that together with mutual rays each other more embellished i stood as one who in himself represses the point of his desire and ventures not to question he so feareth the too much and now the largest and most luculent among those pearls came forward that it might make my desire concerning it content within it then i heard if thou couldst see even as myself the charity that burns among us thy conceits would be expressed but that by waiting thou mayst not come late to the high end i will make answer even unto the thought of which thou art so chary that mountain on whose slope cassino stands was frequented of old upon its summit by a deluded folk and illdisposed and i am he who first up thither bore the name of him who brought upon the earth the truth that so much sublimateth us and such abundant grace upon me shone that all the neighbouring towns i drew away from the impious worship that seduced the world these other fires each one of them were men contemplative enkindled by that heat which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up here is macarius here is romualdus here are my brethren who within the cloisters their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart and i to him the affection which thou showest speaking with me and the good countenance which i behold and note in all your ardours in me have so my confidence dilated as the sun doth the rose when it becomes as far unfolded as it hath the power therefore i pray and thou assure me father if i may so much grace receive that i may thee behold with countenance unveiled he thereupon brother thy high desire in the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled where are fulfilled all others and my own there perfect is and ripened and complete every desire within that one alone is every part where it has always been for it is not in space nor turns on poles and unto it our stairway reaches up whence thus from out thy sight it steals away up to that height the patriarch jacob saw it extending its supernal part what time so thronged with angels it appeared to him but to ascend it now no one uplifts his feet from off the earth and now my rule below remaineth for mere waste of paper the walls that used of old to be an abbey are changed to dens of robbers and the cowls are sacks filled full of miserable flour but heavy usury is not taken up so much against gods pleasure as that fruit which maketh so insane the heart of monks for whatsoever hath the church in keeping is for the folk that ask it in gods name not for ones kindred or for something worse the flesh of mortals is so very soft that good beginnings down below suffice not from springing of the oak to bearing acorns peter began with neither gold nor silver and i with orison and abstinence and francis with humility his convent and if thou lookest at each ones beginning and then regardest whither he has run thou shalt behold

band and the band closed together then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt the gentle lady urged me on behind them up oer that stairway by a single sign so did her virtue overcome my nature nor here below where one goes up and down by natural law was motion eer so swift that it could be compared unto my wing reader as i may unto that devout triumph return on whose account i often for my transgressions weep and beat my breast— thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire and drawn it out again before i saw the sign that follows taurus and was in it o glorious stars o light impregnated with mighty virtue from which i acknowledge all of my genius whatsoeer it be with you was born and hid himself with you he who is father of all mortal life when first i tasted of the tuscan air and then when grace was freely given to me to enter the high wheel which turns you round your region was allotted unto me to you devoutly at this hour my soul is sighing that it virtue may acquire for the stern pass that draws it to itself thou art so near unto the last salvation thus beatrice began thou oughtest now to have thine eves unclouded and acute and therefore ere thou enter farther in look down once more and see how vast a world thou hast already put beneath thy feet so that thy heart as jocund as it may present itself to the triumphant throng that comes rejoicing through this rounded ether i with my sight returned through one and all the sevenfold spheres and i beheld this globe such that i smiled at its ignoble semblance and that opinion i approve as best which doth account it least and he who thinks of something else may truly be called just i saw the daughter of latona shining without that shadow which to me was cause that once i had believed her rare and dense the aspect of thy son hyperion here i sustained and saw how move themselves around and near him maia and dione thence there appeared the temperateness of jove twixt son and father and to me was clear the change that of their whereabout they make and all the seven made manifest to me how great they are and eke how swift they are and how they are in distant habitations the threshingfloor that maketh us so proud to me revolving with the eternal twins was all apparent made from hill to harbour then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes i turned chapter the triumph of christ the virgin mary the apostles gabriel even as a bird mid the beloved leaves quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood throughout the night that hideth all things from us who that she may behold their longedfor looks and find the food wherewith to nourish them in which to her grave labours grateful are anticipates the time on open spray and with an ardent longing waits the sun gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn even thus my lady standing was erect and vigilant turned round towards the zone underneath which the sun displays less haste so that beholding her distraught and wistful such i became as he is who desiring for something yearns and hoping is appeased but brief the space from one when to the other of my awaiting say i and the seeing the welkin grow resplendent more and more and beatrice exclaimed behold the hosts of christs triumphal march and all the fruit harvested by the rolling of these spheres it seemed to me her face was all aflame and eyes she had so full of ecstasy that i must needs pass on without describing as when in nights serene of the full moon smiles trivia among the nymphs eternal who paint the firmament through all its gulfs saw i above the myriads of lamps a sun that one and all of them enkindled een as our own doth the supernal sights and through the living light transparent shone the lucent substance so intensely clear into my sight that i sustained it not o beatrice thou gentle guide and dear to me she said what overmasters thee a virtue is from which naught shields itself there are the wisdom and the omnipotence that oped the thoroughfares twixt heaven and earth for which there erst had been so long a yearning as fire from out a cloud unlocks itself dilating so it finds not room therein and down against its nature falls to earth so did my mind among those aliments becoming larger issue from itself and that which it became cannot remember open thine eyes and look at what i am thou hast beheld such things that strong enough hast thou become to tolerate my smile i was as one who still retains the feeling of a forgotten vision and endeavours in vain to bring it back into his mind when i this invitation heard deserving of so much gratitude it never fades out of the book that chronicles the past if at this moment sounded all the tongues that polyhymnia and her sisters made most lubrical with their delicious milk to aid me to a thousandth of the truth it would not reach singing the holy smile and how the holy aspect it illumed and therefore representing paradise the sacred poem must perforce leap over even as a man who finds his way cut off but whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme and of the mortal shoulder laden with it should blame it not if under this it tremble it is no passage for a little boat this which goes cleaving the audacious prow nor for a pilot who would spare himself why doth my face so much enamour thee that to the garden fair thou turnest not which under the rays of christ is blossoming there is the rose in which the word divine became incarnate there the lilies are by whose perfume the good way was discovered thus beatrice and i who to her counsels was wholly ready once again betook me unto the battle of the feeble brows as in the sunshine that unsullied streams through fractured cloud ere now a meadow of flowers mine eyes with shadow covered oer have seen so troops of splendours manifold i saw illumined from above with burning rays beholding not the source of the effulgence o power benignant that dost so imprint them thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope there to mine eyes that were not strong enough the name of that fair flower i eer invoke morning and evening utterly enthralled my soul to gaze upon the greater fire and when in both mine eyes depicted were the glory and greatness of the living star which there excelleth as it here excelled athwart the heavens a little torch descended formed in a circle like a coronal and cinctured it and whirled itself about it whatever melody most sweetly soundeth on earth and to itself most draws the soul would seem a cloud that rent asunder thunders compared unto the sounding of that lyre wherewith was crowned the

circle lady of heaven while thou followest thy son and makst diviner the sphere supreme because thou enterest there thus did the circulated melody seal itself up and all the other lights were making to resound the name of mary the regal mantle of the volumes all of that world which most fervid is and living with breath of god and with his works and ways extended over us its inner border so very distant that the semblance of it there where i was not yet appeared to me therefore mine eyes did not possess the power of following the incoronated flame which mounted upward near to its own seed and as a little child that towards its mother stretches its arms when it the milk has taken through impulse kindled into outward flame each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached so with its summit that the deep affection they had for mary was revealed to me thereafter they remained there in my sight regina coeli singing with such sweetness that neer from me has the delight departed o what exuberance is garnered up within those richest coffers which had been good husbandmen for sowing here below there they enjoy and live upon the treasure which was acquired while weeping in the exile of

whence comes his thought thus beatrice and those souls beatified transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles flaming intensely in the guise of comets and as the wheels in works of horologes revolve so that the first to the beholder motionless seems and the last one to fly so in like manner did those carols dancing in different measure of their affluence give me the gauge as they were swift or slow from that one which i noted of most beauty beheld i issue forth a fire so happy that none it left there of a greater brightness and around beatrice three several times it whirled itself with so divine a song my fantasy repeats it not to me therefore the pen skips and i write it not since our imagination for such folds much more our speech is of a tint too glaring o holy sister mine who us implorest with such devotion by thine ardent love thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere thereafter having stopped the blessed fire unto my lady did direct its breath which spake in

seen but since this kingdom has made citizens by means of the true faith to glorify it tis well he have the chance to speak thereof as baccalaureate arms himself and speaks not until the master doth propose the question to argue it and not to terminate it so did i arm myself with every reason while she was speaking that i might be ready for such a questioner and such profession say thou good christian manifest thyself what is the faith whereat i raised my brow unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth then turned i round to beatrice and she prompt signals made to me that i should pour the water forth from my internal fountain may grace that suffers me to make confession began i to the great centurion cause my conceptions all to be explicit and i continued as the truthful pen father of thy dear brother wrote of it who put with thee rome into the good way faith is the substance of the things we hope for and evidence of those that are not seen and this appears to me its quiddity then heard i very rightly thou perceivest if well thou understandest why he placed it with substances and then with evidences and i thereafterward the things profound that here vouchsafe to

there find place thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love then added very well has been gone over already of this coin the alloy and weight but tell me if thou hast it in thy purse and i yes

whence hadst thou it and i the large outpouring of holy spirit which has been diffused upon the ancient parchments and the new a syllogism is which proved it to me with such acuteness that compared therewith all demonstration seems to me obtuse and then i heard the ancient and the new postulates that to thee are so conclusive why dost thou take them for the word divine and i the proofs which show the truth to me are the works subsequent whereunto nature neer heated iron yet nor anvil beat twas answered me say who assureth thee that those works ever were the thing itself that must be

holy father spirit who beholdest what thou believedst so that thou oercamest towards the sepulchre more youthful feet began i thou dost wish me in this place the form to manifest of my prompt belief and likewise thou the cause thereof demandest and i respond in one god i believe sole and eterne who moveth all the heavens with love and with desire himself unmoved and of such faith not only have i proofs physical and metaphysical but gives them likewise the truth that from this place rains down through moses through the prophets and the psalms through the evangel and through you who wrote after

my lady full of ecstasy said unto me look look behold the baron for whom below galicia is frequented in the same way as when a dove alights near his companion both of them pour forth circling about and murmuring their affection so one beheld i by the other grand prince glorified to be with welcome greeted lauding the food that there above is eaten but when their gratulations were complete silently coram me each one stood still so incandescent it oercame my sight smiling thereafterwards said beatrice illustrious life by whom the benefactions of our basilica have been described make hope resound within this altitude thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it as jesus to the three gave greater clearness— lift up thy head and make thyself assured for what comes hither from the mortal world must needs be ripened in our radiance this comfort came to me from the second fire wherefore mine eyes i lifted to the hills which bent them down before with too great weight since through his grace our emperor wills that thou shouldst find thee face to face before thy death in the most secret chamber with his counts so that the truth beholden of this court hope which below there rightfully enamours thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others say what it is and how is flowering with it thy mind and say from whence it came to thee thus did the second light again continue and the compassionate who piloted the plumage of my wings in such high flight did in reply anticipate me thus no child whatever the church militant of greater hope possesses as is written in that sun which

disciple who his teacher follows ready and willing where he is expert that his proficiency may be displayed hope said i is the certain expectation of future glory which is the effect of grace divine

goes and enters the dance a winsome maiden only to do honour to the new bride and not from any failing even thus did i behold the brightened splendour approach the two who in a wheel revolved as was beseeming to their ardent love into the song and music there it entered and fixed on them my lady kept her look even as a bride silent and motionless this is the one who lay upon the breast of him our pelican and this is he to the great office from the cross elected my lady thus but therefore none the more did move her sight from its attentive gaze before or afterward these words of hers even as a man who gazes and endeavours to see the eclipsing of the sun a little and who by seeing sightless doth become so i became before that latest fire while it was said why dost thou daze thyself to see a

the trinal breath was made as to escape from danger or fatigue the oars that erst were in the water beaten are all suspended at a whistles sound ah how much in my mind was i disturbed when i turned round to look on beatrice that her i could not see although i was close at her side and in the happy world chapter st john examines dante on charity dantes sight adam while i was doubting for my vision quenched out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it issued a breathing that attentive made me saying while thou recoverest the sense of seeing which in me thou hast consumed tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it begin then and declare to what thy soul is aimed and count it for a certainty sight is in thee bewildered and not dead because the lady who through this divine

speak still farther put it in my thought and said in verity with finer sieve behoveth thee to sift thee it behoveth to say who aimed thy bow at such a target and i by philosophic arguments and by authority that hence descends such love must needs imprint itself in me for good so far as good when comprehended doth straight enkindle love and so much greater as more of goodness in itself it holds then to that essence whose is such advantage that every good which out of it is found is nothing but a ray of its own light more than elsewhither must the mind be moved of every one in loving who discerns the truth in which this evidence is founded such truth he to my intellect reveals who demonstrates to me the primal love of all the sempiternal substances the voice reveals it of the truthful author who says to moses speaking of himself i will make all my goodness pass before thee thou too revealest it to me beginning the loud evangel that proclaims the secret of heaven to earth above all other edict and i heard say by human intellect and by authority concordant with it of all thy loves reserve for god the highest but say again if other cords thou feelest draw thee towards him that thou mayst proclaim with how many teeth this love is biting thee the holy purpose of the eagle of christ not latent was nay rather i perceived whither he fain would my profession lead therefore i recommenced all of those bites which have the power to turn the heart to god unto my charity have been concurrent the being of the world and my own being the death which he endured that i may live and that which all the faithful hope as i do with the forementioned vivid consciousness have drawn me from the sea of love perverse and of the right have placed me on the shore the leaves wherewith embowered is all the garden of the eternal gardener do i love as much as he has granted them of good as soon as i had ceased a song most sweet throughout the heaven resounded and my lady said with the others holy holy holy and as at some keen light one wakes from sleep by reason of the visual spirit that runs unto the splendour passed from coat to coat and he who wakes abhorreth what he sees so all unconscious is his sudden waking until the judgment cometh to his aid so from before mine eyes did beatrice chase every mote with radiance of her own that cast its light a thousand miles and more whence better after than before i saw and in a kind of wonderment i asked about a fourth light that i saw with us and said my lady there within those rays gazes upon its maker the first soul that ever the first virtue did create even as the bough that downward bends its top at transit of the wind and then is lifted by its own virtue which inclines it upward likewise did i the while that she was speaking being amazed and then i was made bold by a desire to speak wherewith i burned and i began o apple that mature alone hast been produced o ancient father to whom each wife is daughter and daughterinlaw devoutly as i can i supplicate thee that thou wouldst speak to me thou seest my wish and i to hear thee quickly speak it not sometimes an animal when covered struggles so that his impulse needs must be apparent by reason of the wrappage following it and in like manner the primeval soul made clear to me athwart its covering how jubilant it was to give me pleasure then breathed without thy uttering it to me thine inclination better i discern than thou whatever thing is surest to thee for i behold it in the truthful mirror that of himself all things parhelion makes and none makes him parhelion of itself thou fain wouldst hear how long ago god placed me within the lofty garden where this lady unto so long a stairway thee disposed and how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure and of the great disdain the proper cause and the language that i used and that i made now son of mine the tasting of the tree not in itself was cause of so great exile but solely the oerstepping of the bounds there whence thy lady moved virgilius four thousand and three hundred and two circuits made by the sun this council i desired and him i saw return to all the lights of his

become and flaked with the triumphant vapours which there together with us had remained my sight was following up their semblances and followed till the medium by excess the passing farther onward took from it whereat the lady who beheld me freed from gazing upward said to me cast down thy sight and see how far thou art turned round since the first time that i had downward looked i saw that i had moved through the whole arc which the first climate makes from midst to end so that i saw the mad track of ulysses past gades and this side well nigh the shore whereon became europa a sweet burden and of this threshingfloor the site to me were more unveiled but the sun was proceeding under my feet a sign and more removed my mind enamoured which is dallying at all times with my lady to bring back to her mine eyes was more than ever ardent and if or art or nature has made bait to catch the eyes and so possess the mind in human flesh or in its portraiture all joined together would appear as nought to the divine delight which shone upon me when to her smiling face i turned me round the virtue that her look endowed me with from the fair nest of leda tore me forth and up into the swiftest heaven impelled me its parts exceeding full of life and lofty are all so uniform i cannot say which beatrice selected for my place but she who was aware of my desire began the while she smiled so joyously that god seemed in her countenance to rejoice the nature of that motion which keeps quiet the centre and all the rest about it moves from hence begins as from its starting point and in this heaven there is no other where than in the mind divine wherein is kindled the love that turns it and the power it rains within a circle light and love embrace it even as this doth the others and that precinct he who encircles it alone controls its motion is not by another meted but all the others measured are by this as ten is by the half and by the fifth and in what manner time in such a pot may have its roots and in the rest its leaves now unto thee can manifest be made o covetousness that mortals dost ingulf beneath thee so that no one hath the power of drawing back his eyes from out thy

wholly by the centesimal on earth neglected shall these supernal circles roar so loud the tempest that has been so long awaited shall whirl the poops about where are the prows so that the fleet shall run its course direct and the true fruit shall follow on the flower chapter god and the angelic hierarchies after the truth against the present life of miserable mortals was unfolded by her who doth imparadise my mind as in a lookingglass a tapers flame he sees who from behind is lighted by it before he has it in his sight or thought and turns him round to see if so the glass tell him the truth and sees that it accords therewith as doth a music with its metre in similar wise my memory recollecteth that i did looking into those fair eyes of which love made the springes to ensnare me and as i turned me round and mine were touched by that which is apparent in that volume whenever on its gyre we gaze intent a point beheld i that was raying out light so acute the sight which it enkindles must close perforce before such great acuteness and whatsoever star seems smallest here would seem to be a moon if placed beside it as one star with another star is placed perhaps at such a distance as appears a halo cincturing the light that paints it when densest is the vapour that sustains it thus distant round the point a circle of fire so swiftly whirled that it would have surpassed whatever motion soonest girds the world and this was by another circumcinct that by a third the third then by a fourth by a fifth the fourth and then by a sixth the fifth the seventh followed thereupon in width so ample now that junos messenger entire would be too narrow to contain it even so the eighth and ninth and every one more slowly moved according as it was in number distant farther from the first and that one had its flame most crystalline from which less distant was the stainless spark i think because more with its truth imbued my lady who in my anxiety beheld me much perplexed said from that point dependent is the heaven and nature all behold that circle most conjoined to it and know thou that its motion is so swift through burning love whereby it is spurred on and i to her if the world were arranged in the order which i see in yonder wheels whats set before me would have satisfied me but in the world of sense we can perceive that evermore the circles are diviner as they are from the centre more remote wherefore if my desire is to be ended in this miraculous and angelic temple that has for confines only love and light to hear behoves me still how the example and the exemplar go not in one fashion since for myself in vain i contemplate it if thine own fingers unto such a knot be insufficient it is no great wonder so hard hath it become for want of trying my lady thus then said she do thou take what i shall tell thee if thou wouldst be sated and exercise on that thy subtlety the circles corporal are wide and narrow according to the more or less of virtue which is distributed through all their parts the greater goodness works the greater weal the greater weal the greater body holds if perfect equally are all its parts therefore this one which sweeps along with it the universe sublime doth correspond unto the circle which most loves and knows on which account if thou unto the virtue apply thy measure not to the appearance of substances that unto thee seem round thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement of more to greater and of less to smaller in every heaven with its intelligence even as remaineth splendid and serene the hemisphere of air when boreas is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest because is purified and resolved the rack that erst disturbed it till the welkin laughs with all the beauties of its pageantry thus did i likewise after that my lady had me provided with her clear response and like a star in heaven the truth was seen and soon as to a stop her words had come not otherwise does iron scintillate when molten than those circles scintillated their coruscation all the sparks repeated and they so many were their number makes more millions than the doubling of the chess i heard them sing hosanna choir by choir to the fixed point which holds them at the ubi and ever will where they have ever been and she who saw the dubious meditations within my mind the primal circles said have shown thee seraphim and cherubim thus rapidly they follow their own bonds to be as like the point as most they can and can as far as they are high in vision those other loves that round about them go thrones of the countenance divine are called because they terminate the primal triad and thou shouldst know that they all have delight as much as their own vision penetrates the truth in which all intellect finds rest from this it may be seen how blessedness is founded in the faculty which sees and not in that which loves and follows next and of this seeing merit is the measure which is brought forth by grace and by good will thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed the second triad which is germinating in such wise in this sempiternal spring that no nocturnal aries despoils perpetually hosanna warbles forth with threefold melody that sounds in three orders of joy with which it is intrined the three divine are in this hierarchy first the dominions and the virtues next and the third order is that of the powers then in the dances twain penultimate the principalities and archangels wheel the last is wholly of angelic sports these orders upward all of them are gazing and downward so prevail that unto god they all attracted are and all attract and dionysius with so great desire to contemplate these orders set himself he named them and distinguished them as i do but gregory afterwards dissented from him wherefore as soon as he unclosed his eyes within this heaven he at himself did smile and if so much of secret truth a mortal proffered on earth i would not have thee marvel for he who saw it here revealed it to him with much more of the truth about these circles chapter beatrices discourse of the creation of the angels and of the fall of lucifer her reproof of foolish and avar icious preachers at what time both the children of latona surmounted by the ram and by the scales together make a zone of the horizon as long as from the time the zenith holds them in equipoise till from that girdle both changing their hemisphere disturb the balance so long her face depicted with a smile did beatrice keep silence while she gazed fixedly at the point which had oercome me then she began i say and i ask not what thou dost wish to hear for i have seen it where centres every when and every ubi not to acquire some good unto himself which is impossible but that his splendour in its resplendency may say subsisto in his eternity outside of time outside all other limits as it pleased him into new loves the eternal love unfolded nor as if torpid did he lie before for neither after nor before proceeded the going forth of god upon these waters matter and form unmingled and conjoined came into being that had no defect een as three arrows from a threestringed bow and as in glass in amber or in crystal a sunbeam flashes so that from its coming to its full being is no interval so from its lord did the triform effect ray forth into its being all together without discrimination of beginning order was concreated and constructed in substances and summit of the world were those wherein the pure act was produced pure potentiality held the lowest part midway bound potentiality with act such bond that it shall never be unbound jerome has written unto you of angels created a long lapse of centuries or ever yet the other world was made but written is this truth in many places by writers of the holy ghost and thou shalt see it if thou lookest well thereat and even reason seeth it somewhat for it would not concede that for so long could be the motors without their perfection now dost thou know both where and when these loves created were and how so that extinct in thy desire already are three fires nor could one reach in counting unto twenty so swiftly as a portion of these angels disturbed the subject of your elements the rest remained and they began this art which thou discernest with so great delight that never from their circling do they cease the occasion of the fall was the accursed presumption of that one whom thou hast seen by all the burden of the world constrained those whom thou here beholdest modest were to recognise themselves as of that goodness which made them apt for so much understanding on which account their vision was exalted by the enlightening grace and their own merit so that they have a full and steadfast will i would not have thee doubt but certain be tis meritorious to receive this grace according as the affection opens to it now round about in this consistory much mayst thou contemplate if these my words be gathered up without all further aid but since upon the earth throughout your schools they teach that such is the angelic nature that it doth hear and recollect and will more will i say that thou mayst see unmixed the truth that is confounded there below equivocating in such like prelections these substances since in gods countenance they jocund were turned not away their sight from that wherefrom not anything is hidden hence they have not their vision intercepted by object new and hence they do not need to recollect through interrupted thought so that below not sleeping people dream believing they speak truth and not believing and in the last is greater sin and shame below you do not journey by one path philosophising so transporteth you love of appearance and the thought thereof and even this above here is endured with less disdain than when is set aside the holy writ or when it is distorted they think not there how much of blood it costs to sow it in the world and how he pleases who in humility keeps close to it each striveth for appearance and doth make his own inventions and these treated are by preachers and the evangel holds its peace one sayeth that the moon did backward turn in the passion of christ and interpose herself so that the sunlight reached not down below and lies for of its own accord the light hid itself whence to spaniards and to indians as to the jews did such eclipse respond florence has not so many lapi and bindi as fables such as these that every year are shouted from the pulpit back and forth in such wise that the lambs who do not know come back from pasture fed upon the wind and not to see the harm doth not excuse them christ did not to his first disciples say go forth and to the world preach idle tales but unto them a true foundation gave and this so loudly sounded from their lips that in the warfare to enkindle faith they made of the evangel shields and lances now men go forth with jests and drolleries to preach and if but well the people laugh the hood puffs out and nothing more is asked but in the cowl there nestles such a bird that if the common people were to see it they would perceive what pardons they confide in for which so great on earth has grown the folly that without proof of any testimony to each indulgence they would flock together by this saint anthony his pig doth fatten and many others who are worse than pigs paying in money without mark of coinage but since we have digressed abundantly turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path so that the way be shortened with the time this nature doth so multiply itself in numbers that there never yet was speech nor mortal fancy that can go so far and if thou notest that which is revealed by daniel thou wilt see that in his thousands number determinate is kept concealed the primal light that all irradiates it by modes as many is received therein as are the splendours wherewith it is mated hence inasmuch as on the act conceptive the affection followeth of love the sweetness therein diversely fervid is or tepid the height behold now and the amplitude of the eternal power since it hath made itself so many mirrors where tis broken one in itself remaining as before

now this world inclines its shadow almost to a level when the midheaven begins to make itself so deep to us that here and there a star ceases to shine so far down as this depth and as advances bright exceedingly the handmaid of the sun the heaven is closed light after light to the most beautiful not otherwise the triumph which for ever plays round about the point that vanquished me seeming enclosed by what itself encloses little by little from my vision faded whereat to turn mine eyes on beatrice my seeing nothing and my love constrained me if what has hitherto been said of her were all concluded in a single praise scant would it be to serve the present turn not only does the beauty i beheld transcend ourselves but truly i believe its maker only may enjoy it all vanquished do i confess me by this passage more than by problem of his theme was ever oercome the comic or the tragic poet for as the sun the sight that trembles most even so the memory of that sweet smile my mind depriveth of its very self from the first day that i beheld her face in this life to the moment of this look the sequence of my song has neer been severed but now perforce this sequence must desist from following her beauty with my verse as every artist at his uttermost such as i leave her to a greater fame than any of my trumpet which is bringing its arduous matter to a final close with voice and gesture of a perfect leader she recommenced we from the greatest body have issued to the heaven that is pure light light intellectual replete with love love of true good replete with ecstasy ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness here shalt thou see the one host and the other of paradise and one in the same aspects which at the final judgment thou shalt see even as a sudden lightning that disperses the visual spirits so that it deprives the eye of impress from the strongest objects thus round about me flashed a living light and left me swathed around with such a veil of its effulgence that i nothing saw ever the love which quieteth this heaven welcomes into itself with such salute to make the candle ready for its flame no sooner had within me these brief words an entrance found than i perceived myself to be uplifted over my own power and i with vision new rekindled me such that no light whatever is so pure but that mine eyes were fortified against it and light i saw in fashion of a river fulvid with its effulgence twixt two banks depicted with an admirable spring out of this river issued living sparks and on all sides sank down into the flowers like unto rubies that are set in gold and then as if inebriate with the odours they plunged again into the wondrous torrent and as one entered issued forth another the high desire that now inflames and moves thee to have intelligence of what thou seest pleaseth me all the more the more it swells but of this water it behoves thee drink before so great a thirst in thee be slaked thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes and added the river and the topazes going in and out and the laughing of the herbage are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces not that these things are difficult in themselves but the deficiency is on thy side for yet thou hast not vision so exalted there is no babe that leaps so suddenly with face towards the milk if he awake much later than his usual custom is as i did that i might make better mirrors still of mine eyes down stooping to the wave which flows that we therein be better made and even as the penthouse of mine eyelids drank of it it forthwith appeared to me out of its length to be transformed to round then as a folk who have been under masks seem other than before if they divest the semblance not their own they disappeared in thus into greater pomp were changed for me the flowerets and the sparks so that i saw both of the courts of heaven made manifest o splendour of god by means of which i saw the lofty triumph of the realm veracious give me the power to say how it i saw there is a light above which visible makes the creator unto every creature who only in beholding him has peace and it expands itself in circular form to such extent that its circumference would be too large a girdle for the sun the semblance of it is all made of rays reflected from the top of primal motion which takes therefrom vitality and power and as a hill in water at its base mirrors itself as if to see its beauty when affluent most in verdure and in flowers so ranged aloft all round about the light mirrored i saw in more ranks than a thousand all who above there have from us returned and if the lowest row collect within it so great a light how vast the amplitude is of this rose in its extremest leaves my vision in the vastness and the height lost not itself but comprehended all the quantity and quality of that gladness there near and far nor add nor take away for there where god immediately doth govern the natural law in naught is relevant into the yellow of the rose eternal that spreads and multiplies and breathes an odour of praise unto the eververnal sun as one who silent is and fain would speak me beatrice drew on and said behold of the white stoles how vast the convent is behold how vast the circuit of our city behold our seats so filled to overflowing that here henceforward are few people wanting on that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed for the crowns sake already placed upon it before thou suppest at this wedding feast shall sit the soul that is to be augustus on earth of noble henry who shall come to redress italy ere she be ready blind covetousness that casts its spell upon you has made you like unto the little child who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse and in the sacred forum then shall be a prefect such that openly or covert on the same road he will not walk with him but long of god he will not be endured in holy office he shall be thrust down where simon magus is for his deserts and make him of alagna lower go chapter the glory of paradise departure of beatrice st bernard in fashion then as of a snowwhite rose displayed itself to me the saintly host whom christ in his own blood had made his bride but the other host that flying sees and sings the glory of him who doth enamour it and the goodness that created it so noble even as a swarm of bees that sinks in flowers one moment and the next returns again to where its labour is to sweetness turned sank into the great flower that is adorned with leaves so many and thence reascended to where its love abideth evermore their faces had they all of living flame and wings of gold and all the rest so white no snow unto that limit doth attain from bench to bench into the flower descending they carried something of the peace and ardour which by the fanning of their flanks they won nor did the interposing twixt the flower and what was oer it of such plenitude of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour because the light divine so penetrates the universe according to its merit that naught can be an obstacle against it this realm secure and full of gladsomeness crowded with ancient people and with modern unto one mark had all its look and love o trinal light that in a single star sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them look down upon our tempest here below if the barbarians coming from some region that every day by helice is covered revolving with her son whom she delights in beholding rome and all her noble works were wonderstruck what time the lateran above all mortal things was eminent— i who to the divine had from the human from time unto eternity had come from florence to a people just and sane with what amazement must i have been filled truly between this and the joy it was my pleasure not to hear and to be mute and as a pilgrim who delighteth him in gazing round the temple of his vow and hopes some day to retell how it was so through the living light my way pursuing directed i mine eyes oer all the ranks now up now down and now all round about faces i saw of charity persuasive embellished by his light and their own smile and attitudes adorned with every grace the general form of paradise already my glance had comprehended as a whole in no part hitherto remaining fixed and round i turned me with rekindled wish my lady to interrogate of things concerning which my mind was in suspense one thing i meant another answered me i thought i should see beatrice and saw an old man habited like the glorious people oerflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks with joy benign in attitude of pity as to a tender father is becoming and she where is she instantly i said whence he to put an end to thy desire me beatrice hath sent from mine own place and if thou lookest up to the third round of the first rank again shalt thou behold her upon the throne her merits have assigned her without reply i lifted up mine eyes and saw her as she made herself a crown reflecting from herself the eternal rays not from that region which the highest thunders is any mortal eye so far removed in whatsoever sea it deepest sinks as there from beatrice my sight but this was nothing unto me because her image descended not to me by medium blurred o lady thou in whom my hope is strong and who for my salvation didst endure in hell to leave the imprint of thy feet of whatsoever things i have beheld as coming from thy power and from thy goodness i recognise the virtue and the grace thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom by all those ways by all the expedients whereby thou hadst the power of doing it preserve towards me thy magnificence so that this soul of mine which thou hast healed pleasing to thee be loosened from the body thus i implored and she so far away smiled as it seemed and looked once more at me then unto the eternal fountain turned and said the old man holy that thou mayst accomplish perfectly thy journeying whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me fly with thine eyes all round about this garden for seeing it will discipline thy sight farther to mount along the ray divine and she the queen of heaven for whom i burn wholly with love will grant us every grace because that i her faithful bernard am as he who peradventure from croatia cometh to gaze at our veronica who through its ancient fame is never sated but says in thought the while it is displayed my lord christ jesus god of very god now was your semblance made like unto this even such was i while gazing at the living charity of the man who in this world by contemplation tasted of that peace thou son of grace this jocund life began he will not be known to thee by keeping ever thine eyes below here on the lowest place but mark the circles to the most remote until thou shalt behold enthroned the queen to whom this realm is subject and devoted i lifted up mine eyes and as at morn the oriental part of the horizon surpasses that wherein the sun goes down thus as if going with mine eyes from vale to mount i saw a part in the remoteness surpass in splendour all the other front and even as there where we await the pole that phaeton drove badly blazes more the light and is on either side diminished so likewise that pacific oriflamme gleamed brightest in the centre and each side in equal measure did the flame abate and at that centre with their wings expanded more than a thousand jubilant angels saw i each differing in effulgence and in kind i saw there at their sports and at their songs a beauty smiling which the gladness was within the eyes of all the other saints and if i had in speaking as much wealth as in imagining i should not dare to attempt the smallest part of its delight bernard as soon as he beheld mine eyes fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour his own with such affection turned to her that it made mine more ardent to behold chapter st bernard points out the saints in the white rose absorbed in his delight that contemplator assumed the willing office of a teacher and gave beginning to these holy words the wound that mary closed up and anointed she at her feet who is so beautiful she is the one who opened it and pierced it within that order which the third seats make is seated rachel lower than the other with beatrice in manner as thou seest sarah rebecca judith and her who was ancestress of the singer who for dole of the misdeed said miserere mei canst thou behold from seat to seat descending down in gradation as with each ones name i through the rose go down from leaf to leaf and downward from the seventh row even as above the same succeed the hebrew women dividing all the tresses of the flower because according to the view which faith in christ had taken these are the partition by which the sacred stairways are divided upon this side where perfect is the flower with each one of its petals seated are those who believed in christ who was to come upon the other side where intersected with vacant spaces are the semicircles are those who looked to christ already come and as upon this side the glorious seat of the lady of heaven and the other seats below it such a great division make so opposite doth that of the great john who ever holy desert and martyrdom endured and afterwards two years in hell and under him thus to divide were chosen francis and benedict and augustine and down to us the rest from round to round behold now the high providence divine for one and other aspect of the faith in equal measure shall this garden fill and know that downward from that rank which cleaves midway the sequence of the two divisions not by their proper merit are they seated but by anothers under fixed conditions for these are spirits one and all assoiled before they any true election had well canst thou recognise it in their faces and also in their voices puerile if thou regard them well and hearken to them now doubtest thou and doubting thou art silent but i will loosen for thee the strong bond in which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast within the amplitude of this domain no casual point can possibly find place no more than sadness can or thirst or hunger for by eternal law has been established whatever thou beholdest so that closely the ring is fitted to the finger here and therefore are these people festinate unto true life not sine causa here more and less excellent among themselves the king by means of whom this realm reposes in so great love and in so great delight that no will ventureth to ask for more in his own joyous aspect every mind creating at his pleasure dowers with grace diversely and let here the effect suffice and this is clearly and expressly noted for you in holy scripture in those twins who in their mother had their anger roused according to the colour of the hair therefore with such a grace the light supreme consenteth that they worthily be crowned without then any merit of their deeds stationed are they in different gradations differing only in their first acuteness tis true that in the early centuries with innocence to work out their salvation sufficient was the faith of parents only after the earlier ages were completed behoved it that the males by circumcision unto their innocent wings should virtue add but after that the time of grace had come without the baptism absolute of christ such innocence below there was retained look now into the face that unto christ hath most resemblance for its brightness only is able to prepare thee to see christ on her did i behold so great a gladness rain down borne onward in the holy minds created through that altitude to fly that whatsoever i had seen before did not suspend me in such admiration nor show me such similitude of god and the same love that first descended there ave maria gratia plena singing in front of her his wings expanded wide unto the canticle divine responded from every part the court beatified so that each sight became serener for it o holy father who for me endurest to be below here leaving the sweet place in which thou sittest by eternal lot who is the angel that with so much joy into the eyes is looking of our queen enamoured so that he seems made of fire thus i again recourse had to the teaching of that one who delighted him in mary as doth the star of morning in the sun and he to me such gallantry and grace as there can be in angel and in soul all is in him and thus we fain would have it because he is the one who bore the palm down unto mary when the son of god to take our burden on himself decreed but now come onward with thine eyes as i speaking shall go and note the great patricians of this most just and merciful of empires those two that sit above there most enrapture as being very near unto augusta are as it were the two roots of this rose he who upon the left is near her placed the father is by whose audacious taste the human species so much bitter tastes upon the right thou seest that ancient father of holy church into whose keeping christ the keys committed of this lovely flower and he who all the evil days beheld before his death of her the beauteous bride who with the spear and with the nails was won beside him sits and by the other rests that leader under whom on manna lived the people ingrate fickle and stiffnecked opposite peter seest thou anna seated so well content to look upon her daughter her eyes she moves not while she sings hosanna and opposite the eldest household father lucia sits she who thy lady moved when to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows but since the moments of thy vision fly here will we make full stop as a good tailor who makes the gown according to his cloth and unto the first love will turn our eyes that looking upon him thou penetrate as far as possible through his effulgence truly lest peradventure thou recede moving thy wings believing to advance by prayer behoves it that grace be obtained grace from that one who has the power to aid thee and thou shalt follow me with thy affection that from my words thy heart turn not aside and he began this holy orison chapter prayer to the virgin the threefold circle of the trin ity mystery of the divine and human nature thou virgin mother daughter of thy son humble and high beyond all other creature the limit fixed of the eternal counsel thou art the one who such nobility to human nature gave that its creator did not disdain to make himself its creature within thy womb rekindled was the love by heat of which in the eternal peace after such wise this flower has germinated here unto us thou art a noonday torch of charity and below there among mortals thou art the living fountainhead of hope lady thou art so great and so prevailing that he who wishes grace nor runs to thee his aspirations without wings would fly not only thy benignity gives succour to him who asketh it but oftentimes forerunneth of its own accord the asking in thee compassion is in thee is pity in thee magnificence in thee unites whateer of goodness is in any creature now doth this man who from the lowest depth of the universe as far as here has seen one after one the spiritual lives supplicate thee through grace for so much power that with his eyes he may uplift himself higher towards the uttermost salvation and i who never burned for my own seeing more than i do for his all of my prayers proffer to thee and pray they come not short that thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud of his mortality so with thy prayers that the chief pleasure be to him displayed still farther do i pray thee queen who canst whateer thou wilt that sound thou mayst preserve after so great a vision his affections let thy protection conquer human movements see beatrice and all the blessed ones my prayers to second clasp their hands to thee the eyes beloved and revered of god fastened upon the speaker showed to us how grateful unto her are prayers devout then unto the eternal light they turned on which it is not credible could be by any creature bent an eye so clear and i who to the end of all desires was now approaching even as i ought the ardour of desire within me ended bernard was beckoning unto me and smiling that i should upward look but i already was of my own accord such as he wished because my sight becoming purified was entering more and more into the ray of the high light which of itself is true from that time forward what i saw was greater than our discourse that to such vision yields and yields the memory unto such excess even as he is who seeth in a dream and after dreaming the imprinted passion remains and to his mind the rest returns not even such am i for almost utterly ceases my vision and distilleth yet within my heart the sweetness born of it even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed even thus upon the wind in the light leaves were the soothsayings of the sibyl lost o light supreme that dost so far uplift thee from the conceits of mortals to my mind of what thou didst appear relend a little and make my tongue of so great puissance that but a single sparkle of thy glory it may bequeath unto the future people for by returning to my memory somewhat and by a little sounding in these verses more of thy victory shall be conceived i think the keenness of the living ray which i endured would have bewildered me if but mine eyes had been averted from it and i remember that i was more bold on this account to bear so that i joined my aspect with the glory infinite o grace abundant by which i presumed to fix my sight upon the light eternal so that the seeing i consumed therein i saw that in its depth far down is lying bound up with love together in one volume what through the universe in leaves is scattered substance and accident and their operations all interfused together in such wise that what i speak of is one simple light the universal fashion of this knot methinks i saw since more abundantly in saying this i feel that i rejoice one moment is more lethargy to me than five and twenty centuries to the emprise that startled neptune with the shade of argo my mind in this wise wholly in suspense steadfast immovable attentive gazed and evermore with gazing grew enkindled in presence of that light one such becomes that to withdraw therefrom for other prospect it is impossible he eer consent because the good which object is of will is gathered all in this and out of it that is defective which is perfect there shorter henceforward will my language fall of what i yet remember than an infants who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast not because more than one unmingled semblance was in the living light on which i looked for it is always what it was before but through the sight that fortified itself in me by looking one appearance only to me was ever changing as i changed within the deep and luminous subsistence of the high light appeared to me three circles of threefold colour and of one dimension and by the second seemed the first reflected as iris is by iris and the third seemed fire that equally from both is breathed o how all speech is feeble and falls short of my conceit and this to what i saw is such tis not enough to call it little o light eterne sole in thyself that dwellest sole knowest thyself and known unto thyself and knowing lovest and smilest on thyself that circulation which being thus conceived appeared in thee as a reflected light when somewhat contemplated by mine eyes within itself of its own very colour seemed to me painted with our effigy wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein as the geometrician who endeavours to square the circle and discovers not by taking thought the principle he wants even such was i at that new apparition i wished to see how the image to the circle conformed itself and how it there finds place but my own wings were not enough for this had it not been that then my mind there smote a flash of lightning wherein came its wish here vigour failed the lofty fantasy but now was turning my desire and will even as a wheel that equally is moved the love which moves the sun and the other stars
