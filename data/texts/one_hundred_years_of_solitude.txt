many years later as he faced the firing squad colonel aureliano buendía was to remember that distant after noon when his father took him to discov er ice at that time macondo was a village of twenty adob e houses built on the ba nk of a river of clear water that ran a long a bed of polished stones which were white and enormo us like prehis toric eggs t he world was so recen t that many things lacked names and in order to i ndicate them it was necessary to point every year during the month of march a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village and with a great uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would displa y new inventions first they brought the magnet a heavy gyp sy with an u ntamed bear d and sparro w hands w ho introduced himself as melquíades put on a bol d public demonstration of what he hims elf called the eighth wonder of the learned al chemists of macedonia he went from house to ho use dragging two metal ingots and everybody wa s amazed to see pots pans tongs and braziers tumb le down from their places and beams creak from the desperati on of nails and screws trying to emer ge and even objects that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had b een search ed for most and went drag ging along in turbulent confusion behind melquíades’ magical irons “things have a life of their own” the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accen t “it’s simply a ma tter of wakin g up their souls” josé arcadio buend ía w hose unbridled imagination always went beyond the ge nius of nature and even beyon d miracles a nd magic thought that it wo uld be possible to make use of that useless invention to extract gold from the bowels of the earth melquíades w ho was an honest man warned hi m “it won’t work f or that” but josé arcadio b uendía at that time did no t believe in the hones ty of gypsies so he traded his mule and a pair of goats for the two magnetize d ingots úrsula iguarán his wife who relied on those animal s to increase their poor domestic holdi ngs was un able to dissuade him “very soon w ell have gold enough and more to pave the floors of the house” her husband replied for several months he worked hard to demonstr ate th e truth of his idea he explored every inch o f the region even the riverbed dragging the two iron ingots al ong and reciting melquíades’ incantation aloud the only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit of fifteenthcentury armor which had all of its pieces soldered together with r ust and inside of which there was the hollow resonance of an enormous stonefilled go urd when josé arcadio bue ndía and the four men of his expedition managed to take th e armor apart they found in side a calci fied skeleton with a co pper locket containing a woman’s hai r around its neck in march the gypsies returned this time they br ought a telescope and a m agnifying glass the size of a drum which they exhibited as the latest dis covery of the jews of amsterdam they placed a gypsy woman at one end of the villa ge and set up the telescope at the entr ance to the tent for the price of five reales peop le could loo k into the telescope and s ee th e gypsy woman an arm’s length away “science has eliminated distance” melquíades proclaimed “in a short time man will be able to see what is happenin g in any pla ce in th e world without leaving his own house” a burning noonday sun brought out a startling demonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass t hey put a pile of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun’s rays josé arcadio buendía who had still not been consoled for the failu re of big magnets conceived the idea of using that inventio n as a weapon of war a gain melquía des tried to dissuade him but he finally accepted the two m agnetized ingo ts and three colonial coin s in exchange for the magnifying glass úrsula wept in cons ternation t hat money was from a ch est of gold coins that her father had p ut together ova an entir e life of privation and that s he had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper occasion to make use of it josé arcadio buendía made no a t tempt to console her completely absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abn egation of a scientist and even at the risk of his own life in an attempt to sh ow the effects of the glass on enemy troops he exposed himself to the concentra tion of the s un’s rays and suffered burns wh ich turned into sores that took a long time to heal over the protests of his wife who was al arme d at such a dangerous inve ntion at one point he was ready to set the ho use on fire he would spend hours on end in his room calculating th e strategic possibilities of his novel w eapon until he succeeded in putting together a manual of startling instructional clarity and an irresistible po wer of conviction he sent it to the government accompani ed by numerous descriptions of his experiments and several pages of explanatory sketches by a messenger who crossed the mountains got lost in mea sureless swamps forded storm y rivers and was on th e point of perishing under the la sh of despair plague an d wild beasts until he found a route that joined the one us ed by the mul es that carried the mail in spite of th e fact tha t a trip to th e capital was little less th an impossible at th at tim e josé arcadi o buendía p romised to undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so t hat he could put on some practical demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities and could tr ain them himself in the complicated art of solar war for several years h e waited for a n answer fi nally tired o f waiting he bemoaned to melquíades the failure of his project and the gypsy then gav e him a con vincing proof of his honesty he gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass and he left him i n addition some portuguese maps and se veral instruments of navigation in his own handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of th e studies by monk herm ann which he left josé arcadio so that he would be able to make use of the as trolabe the co mpass and the sextant josé arcadio buendía spent th e long months of the rainy season shut up in a small room that he had built in the rear of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments having completely aban doned his domestic obligations he spent entire ni ghts i n the courtyard wa tching the course of the stars and he almost con tracted suns troke from trying to establis h an exact method to ascertain noon when he became an expert in the use and manipula tion of his instruments he conceived a notion of space that al lowed him to navigate across unknown seas to visit uninhabited territories and to establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study that was the period i n which he acquired the h abit of talking to himsel f of walking through the house wi thout pa ying attention to anyone as úrsula and the children brok e their backs in the garden growing banana an d caladium cassava and yams ahuyama roots and e ggplants suddenly without warning his feverish activity was interrupted a nd was replaced by a kind of fascination he spent several days as if he were bewitched softly repeating to hi mself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his own understanding finally one tuesday in decemb er at lu nchtime all at once h e released the whole weight of his tor ment the children would re member for the rest of their lives the august solemnity with which their father devastated b y his prolonged vigil a nd by the wrath of his imagination revealed his discovery to them “the earth is round like a n orange” úrsula lost her patience “if you have to go crazy please go crazy all by yo urself” she shouted “but don’t try to put your gypsy ideas into th e heads of the children” josé arcadio buendía impassive did not let himself be frightened by the de speration of his wife who in a s eizure of rage mashed the astrolabe against the floo r he built another one he gathered the men of the village in his little room and he demonstrated to them with theories that none of them could und erstand the possibility of returning to where one had set out by consistently sailing east the whole village was convinced that josé arcadio buendía had lost hi s reason wh en melquíades returned to set thing s straight he gave public praise to the intelligen ce of a man who from pure astronomical speculation had evolved a theo ry that had already been proved in practice although unknown in macondo until then and as a proof of his admiration he mad e him a gift that was to h ave a profound influence on the future of the village the laboratory of an alchemist by then melquíades had aged with surprising rapidi ty on his first trips he seemed to b e the same age as josé arcadio buendía but while the latter had preserved his extraordinary strength which permitted hi m to pull do wn a horse b y grabbing its ears the gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse by some tenacious illness it was in reality the re sult of multiple and rare di seases contracted on hi s innumerable trips around the world according to wh at he himself said as he spoke to j osé arcadio buendía whi le helping him set up th e laboratory death follo wed him ev erywhere sn iffing at the cuffs of his pants but never deciding to give him th e final clutch of its cla ws he was a fugitive from all the plagues and catastrophes that had ever las hed mankind he had s urvived pellagra in persia scurvy in the malayan archipelago leprosy in al exandria beriberi in ja pan bubonic plague in madagascar an earthquake in sicily and a disast rous shipwreck in the strait of ma gellan that prodigious creature said to possess th e keys of no stradamus was a gloomy man enveloped in a sad aura with an asiatic look that seem ed to know wh at there was on the o ther side of thin gs he wore a large black hat th at loo ked like a ra ven with wid espread wings and a velv et vest acros s which th e patina of th e centuries h ad skated bu t in spite of his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth he had a hu man burden an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily life he would complain of the ailments of ol d age he suffered from the most insignificant economic di fficulties and he had stopped laughing a long tim e back because scurvy had made his teeth drop out on that suffocating noontime when the gypsy revealed his secrets josé arcadio buendía had the certainty that it was the beginning of a great friendship the children were startled by his fantastic stories aureliano who could not have been more th an five at the time woul d remember hi m for the rest of his life as he saw him that after noon sitting against the metallic and quivering light from the window lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest rea ches of th e imagination while down over his temples there flo wed the grease that was b eing melted by the heat josé arcadio his older brother would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary memory to all of his descendants úrsula on the other hand held a ba d memory of that visit for she had entered the room just as melquíades had carelessl y broken a flask of bichloride of mercury “it’s the smell of the devil” she said “not at all” melquíades corrected her “it has b een proven that the devil has sulphuric properties and this is just a little corr osive sublimate” always did actic he wen t into a learn ed expositio n of the diabolical properties of cinnabar but úrsula paid no atten tion to him altho ugh she took the children off to pray that biting odor would stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of melquíades the rudimentary laboratory—in addition to a prof usion of pots funnels retorts filters and sieves—was made up of a primitive water pipe a gl ass beaker with a long thin neck a reproductio n of the philosopher’s egg and a still the gypsies th emselves had built in accordance with modern descriptions of the threearmed alemb ic of mary th e jew along with those items melquíades left samples of the seven metals that cor responded to the s even planets the formulas of moses and zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold and a s et of notes a nd sketches concerning the processes of the grea t teaching that would permit t hose who coul d interpret them to un dertake the manufacture of the philosopher’s stone seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the quantity of gold josé arcadio buendía paid court to úrsula for several week s so that sh e would let him dig up her colonial coins and in crease th em by as many times as it was possible to subdivide mercury úrsula gave in as always to her husb and’s unyielding obstinacy then josé arcadi o buendía threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings orpiment brimstone and lead he put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil until he got a thick and pestilential syrup which was more like common caramel than valuable gold in risky and desperate processes of distillation melted with the seven pla netary m etals mixed with hermetic mercury and vitriol of cyprus and put back to coo k in hog fat for lack of any radish oil úrsula’s precious inheritance was reduced to a large piece of burnt hog cracklings that wa s firmly stuck to the bottom of th e pot when the gypsies came back úrsula h ad turned th e whole population of the village against them but curiosity was greater than fear for that ti me th e gyp sies went a bout the to wn making a deafening noise with all manner of musical instru ments while a hawker a nnounced th e exhibition of the mos t fabulous discovery of the n aciancen es so that ever yone went to the ten t and by p aying one cen t they saw a youthful melquíades recovere d unwrinkled with a new and flashing set of teeth thos e who rem embered his gums that had been destroyed by s curvy his flaccid cheeks and his withered lips trembled with fear at the fina l proof of the gypsy’s supernatural power the fear turned into panic when melquíades took out hi s teeth intact encased in their gums and showed them to the audience for an instant—a fleeting in stant in which he wen t back to being the same decrepit man of years past—and put them back again and smiled once more with the full control of his restored youth even josé arcadio buendía hi mself considered that melquíades’ knowledge had reached unb earable extremes but he felt a healthy excitement when th e gypsy explained to him atone the workings of his false teeth it seem ed so simple and so prodigious at th e same time that overnight he lost all interest in his experiment s in alchemy he underwent a new cri sis of bad humor he did not go back to ea ting regularly and he would spend the d ay walking through the house “incredible things are happening in the worl d” he said to úrsula “right there across the river there a re all kinds of magical instrument s while we keep on living like donkeys” those wh o had known him since the foundation of macondo wer e startled at how mu ch he had ch anged under melquíades’ influence at first josé arcadio buendía had been a kind of youthful patriarch who would give instructions for planting and advice f or the raising of children and animals and who col laborated with everyone even in the p hysical work for the welfare of the co mmunity since his hous e from the v ery first had been the best in the village the other s had been bu ilt in its image and likeness it had a small well lighted living roost a dining room in the shap e of a terrace with gaily colored flowers two bedrooms a courtyard with a gigantic chestnut tr ee a well kep t garden and a corral where goats pigs and hens lived in peaceful communion the only animals that were prohibited not just in his house but in the entire settlement were fighting cocks úrsula’s capacity for work was th e sam e as th at of her husband active sm all severe that woma n of unbreakable nerves who at no moment in he r life had been heard to sing seemed to b e everywhere from dawn until quite la te at night always pursued by th e soft whispering of her stiff starched petticoats tha nks to her the floors of tamped earth the unwhi tewashed mud walls the rustic wooden furniture they had built them selves were always dean and the old chests where they kept their cl othes exhaled the warm s mell of basil josé arcadio buendía who was the most enterpr ising man ever to be seen in the village had set up the placement of the houses in such a way th at from all of them one could reach the river and draw water with the sam e effort and he had lined up the streets with such good sense th at no house got more su n than another during the hot time of day with in a few years macondo was a village that was more orderly and hard working than any k nown until then by its three hundred inhabitants it was a truly happy village where no one was over thirty years of age and where no one had died since the time of its founding josé arcadio buendía had built traps and cages in a short time h e filled not only his own house but all of those in the village with troupials canaries bee eaters and redbreasts the concert o f so many different birds became so di sturbing that úrsula would plug her ears with b eeswax so as not to los e her sense of re ality the first time that melquíades’ tribe arrived selling glass balls for headaches ever yone was sur prised that they had been able to find that village lost in the drowsiness of the swamp and the gypsi es confessed that they ha d found thei r way b y the song of the birds that spirit of social initiative disappeared i n a short time pulled away by the fever of the magnets the astronomical calculations the dreams of transmutation and the urge to discover the wonders of the world from a clean and active ma n josé arcadio buendía changed into a man lazy in appearance careless in his dress with a wild be ard that úrsula managed to trim with great effort and a kitchen knife there were many who consider ed him the victim of some strange spell but even those most convin ced of his madness left wo rk and family to follow him when he brought out his tools to clear the land and asked the assemble d group to open a way that would put macondo in contact with the great inventions josé arcadio buendía wa s completel y ignorant of th e geography of the regi on he knew that to the east th ere lay an imp enetrable mo untain chain and tha t on the other side of the mountains ther e was th e ardent city of ri ohacha wh ere in times past—accordi ng to wha t he had been told by th e first aurelia no buendía his grandfa ther—sir francis drake had gone crocodile hunting with cannons and that he repaired hem and stuffed them with straw to bring to queen eli zabeth in hi s youth josé arcadio buendía and hi s men with wives and children an imals and all kinds of domestic implements had crossed the moun tains in sear ch of an ou tlet to the s ea and after twentysix months they gave up the expedition and founded ma condo so they would not have to go back it was therefore a route that did not interest him for it could lead only to th e past to the south lay the swamps covered with an eterna l vegetable sc um and th e whole vast universe of the great swamp whi ch accordin g to wha t the gypsies s aid had no limits the great swamp in the wes t mingled with a boundless extension of water where there were softskinned ceta ceans that had the head and tor so of a woman causing the ruination of sailors with the ch arm of their extraordinar y breasts the gypsies sailed along that route for six m onths before they reached the strip of land over which the m ules that carried the mail passed acco rding to josé arcadio buendía’s calculations the only p ossibility of contact with civilization lay alon g the northern route so he handed out clearing tools and h unting weap ons to th e same men who had b een with him during the founding of macondo he threw his d irectional instruments an d his maps i nto a knapsa ck and he u ndertook th e reckless adventure during the first days they did not co me across any appreciab le obstacle they went d own alon g the stony ba nk of the river to the pla ce where yea rs before they had found the soldier’s armor and from there they went in to the woods along a path b etween wild orange trees at the en d of the first week th ey kil led and roasted a d eer bu t they agreed to eat only h alf of it and s alt the rest f or the da ys that lay ahead with that precaution they tried to postpone th e necessity o f having to eat macaws whose blue flesh had a h arsh and musky taste th en for more than ten d ays they did not see th e sun again the ground became soft a nd damp like volcanic as h and the vegetation wa s thicker and thicker and the cries of the birds and the uproar of the monk eys became more and m ore remote and the world became eternally sad the men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their mos t ancient m emories in that paradise of dampness and silence going back to before original sin as their boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes des troyed bloody lilies and golden salaman ders for a week almost without speaking they went ahead l ike sleepwalkers through a universe of grief lighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects and their lu ngs were ov erwhelmed by a suffocating smell of blood they could not r eturn because the strip th at they were opening as they went along would soon close u p with a new ve getation that almos t seemed to grow before their eyes “ it’s all right” josé arca dio buendía wo uld say “the main thing is not to lose our bearings” always following his compass he kept on guiding his men to ward the invisible north so that they wo uld be able to get out of that ench anted region it was a thick night starless but the darkness was becom ing impregnated with a fresh and clear air exhausted by the long crossing they hung up their hammocks and slept deeply for the first time in two weeks when they woke up with the sun alrea dy high in the sky they were speechl ess with fascination before them surrounded by ferns and palm trees white and powdery in the silent morning light was an enor mous spanish galleon tilted slightly to the starboar d it had hang ing from its intact masts the dirty rags of its sails in the midst of its rigging which wa s adorned with orchids the hull co vered with a n armor of petrified barnacles a nd soft moss was firmly fastened into a surface of stones the wh ole structure seemed to o ccupy its own space one of solitude and oblivion protected from the vices of time and the habits o f the birds inside where the expedi tionaries explored with careful intent there was nothing but a thick forest of flowers the discovery of the galleon an indication of the proximity of the se a broke josé arcadio buendía’s drive he considered it a trick of his whimsical fate to have searched for the sea withou t finding it at the cost of countless sacrifices an d suffering and to have found it all of a sudden without look ing for it as if it lay acr oss his pa th like an insurmountable object man y years la ter colonel aureliano buendía crossed t he region again when it was already a regular mail route and the only part of the ship he found was its burnedo ut frame in the midst of a field of poppies only then convin ced tha t the story had no t been som e product of his father’s imagination did he wonder how the gall eon had been able to get inland to th at spot but josé arcadio buendía did not concern himself with that when he found th e sea after another four days’ journey from the galleon his dreams ended as he faced that ashen f oamy dirty sea which h ad not merited the risks a nd sacrifices of the adven ture “god damn i t” he shouted “macondo is surrounded by water on all sides” the idea of a peninsular macondo prevailed for a long time i nspired by the arbitrary map tha t josé arcadio buendía sketched on his return from the expedition he drew it in rage evilly exaggerating the difficulties of comm unication as if to punish himself for the absolute l ack of sense with which he had chosen the place “we’ll never get anywhere” he lamented to úrsula “we’re going to rot our lives away here without receiving the benefits of science” that certainty mulled over for several months in the small room he used as his laboratory brough t him to th e conception of the plan to move maeondo to a b etter place but that tim e úrsula had anticipated his feverish designs with the s ecret and implacable labor o f a small an t she predis posed the women of the village again st the flightiness of their husbands who were already prepar ing for the move josé arcadio buendía did not know at what moment or because of what adverse forces his plan had become enveloped in a web of prete xts disappointments and evasions until it turned i nto nothing but an illusion úrsula watched him with innocent attention an d even felt some pity for him on the morning when she found him in the back room muttering about his plans for moving as he placed his laboratory pieces in th eir original boxes she l et him finish she let him n ail up the boxes and put his initials on them with an inked brush withou t reproaching him but knowing now t hat he knew because she had heard him say so in his so ft monologues that the men of the village would not back him up in his undertaking only when he be gan to take down the door of the room did úrsul a dare ask him what h e was doing and he answered with a certai n bitterness “since no one wants to leave we’ll leave all by ourselves” úrsula did not become upset “we will not leave” she said “we will stay here because we have had a son here” “we have still not had a death” he said “a person does not bel ong to a place until there is someone dead under the ground” úrsula replie d with a soft firmness “if i have to die for the rest of you to stay here i wi ll die” josé arcadio buendía had not thought that his wi fe’s will w as so firm he tried to seduce her with the cha rm of his fantasy with the promise of a prodigious world where all one had to do was sprinkle some magic liqui d on th e ground and th e plants would bear fruit whenever a man wished and where all manner of instruments against pain were sold at bargain prices but úrsula was insensible to his clairvoyance “instead of going around thinking about your cr azy inventions you should be worrying abou t your sons” she replied “look at the s tate they’re i n running wild just like donkeys” josé arcadio buendía took his wife’s words li terally he looked out the window and saw the barefoot children in the s unny garden and he had the impressi on that onl y at tha t insta nt had th ey begun to exist conceived by úrsula’s spell so mething occurred inside of him then something mysterious a nd definitive that uprooted him from his own time and carried him adrift through an unexplored region of his memory while úrsula c ontinued sweeping the hou se which was safe now from being abandoned for the rest of her life he stood there with an absor bed look co ntemplating the children until his eyes becam e moist and h e dried them with th e back of his han d exhaling a deep sigh of resignation “all right” he said “tell them to com e help me tak e the things out of the bo xes” josé arcadio the older o f the children was fourteen he had a square head thick hai r and his father’s character althou gh he had the same impu lse for growth and physical strength it was early evident that he lacked imagination he had been conceived and born during th e difficult crossing of the mountai ns before the founding of macondo and his parents gave tha nks to heaven when th ey saw he had no animal features aureliano the firs t human being to be born in macondo would be six years old in march he was silen t and withdr awn he h ad wept in his mother’s wo mb and ha d been born with his eyes open as they were cutting the umbilical cord he m oved his head from side to side taki ng in the th ings in the room and ex amining the faces of th e people with a fearless curiosity then indifferent to thos e who cam e close to l ook at him he kept his atten tion concentra ted on the palm roof which looked as if it were abo ut to collaps e under the tremendous pressure of t he rain úrsula did not remember the intensity of that look a gain until on e day when little aurelia no at th e age of three went into the kitchen at the mom ent she was tak ing a pot o f boiling soup from the stove and putting it on the tabl e the child perplexed said from the doorway “it’s going to spill” the pot was firm ly placed in the center of the tabl e but just as soon as the chil d made his announcement it began an unmistakable movement toward the edge as if impelled by some inner dynamism and it fell and broke on the floor úrsula alarmed told her husband about the episode but he interpreted it as a natural phe nomenon th at was the way he always was alien to the existence of his sons partly becaus e he consid ered childhood as a period of mental insufficiency and partly because he was always too a bsorbed in his fantastic speculations but since the afternoon when he called the child ren in to help him unpack the things in the laboratory he gave them his best hou rs in the sm all separate room where the walls were gradually being covered by strange maps and fabulous drawin gs he taught them to read and write and do sums and he spoke to them about the wonders of the world not only where his learning had extended but forcing the limits of his imagination to extrem es it was in that wa y that th e boys ended up learning that in the southern extremes of africa there were men so intelligent a nd peaceful that their onl y pastim e was to sit and think and tha t it was possi ble to cross the aegean s ea on foot by jumping from island to island all the way to the port of salonika those hallucinati ng sessions remained printed on th e mem ories of the boys in suc h a wa y that man y years later a second befor e the regular army officer gave the firing squad th e command to fire colon el aureliano buendía saw once more that warm march afternoon on which his father had interrupted the lesson in physics and stood fascinated with his hand in the air and his eyes motionless listening to the distant pipes drums and jingles of the gypsies who were comi ng to the village once more announci ng the latest and most startling discovery of the sages of memphis they were n ew gypsies young men and women who knew only their own language handsome specimens with oily skins and intelligent hand s whose dances and music sowed a panic of uproarious joy through the streets with parrots pain ted all colors reciting italian arias and a hen who laid a hundred golden eggs to the sound of a tambourine and a tr ained monk ey who read minds and the multiuse machine tha t could be used at the s ame time to s ew on butto ns and reduce fevers and the apparatus to make a person forget his bad memories and a poultice to lose time and a thousand more inventi ons so ingenious and unu sual that josé arcadio buendía must have wan ted to invent a memo ry machine so th at he could rememb er them all in an inst ant they transfo rmed the village the inhabitants of macondo found themselv es lost is their own streets confused by the crowded fair holding a child by each hand so as n ot to lose th em in the tu mult bumping into acrobats with goldcapped teeth and jugglers with six arms suffo cated by the mingled breath of manure an d sandals that the crowd exhaled josé arcadi o buendía went about everywhere like a madman looking for melquíades so that h e could reveal to him the infinite secrets of that fabulou s nightmare he asked several gypsies who did not understand his language finally he reached th e place where melquíades used to set u p his tent an d he found a taciturn ar menian who in spanish was hawking a syrup to make oneself invisible he had drunk do wn a glass of the amber substance in one gulp as josé arcadio buendía elbowed his way throu gh the absorbed group that was witnessing th e spectacl e and was able to ask his question the gy psy wrapped him in the frightful climate of his look before he turned into a puddle of pestilent ial and smoking pitch over which the echo of his reply still floated “melquíades is dead ” upset by the news josé arcadio buendía stood motionless trying to rise above his a ffliction until the group dispersed called away by other artifices and th e puddle of the taciturn armenian evaporated co mpletely other gypsies confirmed later on that melquíades had in fact succumbed to the fever on the beach at singapore and that his body had been thrown into the deepest part of the java se a the children had no interest in the news they insisted that their father take them to see the overwhelming novelty of the sages of memphis tha t was being advertised at the entrance of a tent that according to what was said had belonged to king solomon they insisted so much that josé arcadio buendía paid the thirty reales and led them into the center of the tent wh ere there wa s a giant with a hairy tor so and a sh aved head wi th a cop per ring in his nose and a heavy iron chain on his a nkle watching over a pirate chest when it was opened by the giant the chest gave off a glacia l exhalation inside there was only an enormous transparent block with i nfinite internal needles in which th e light of the su nset was broken up into colored stars disconcerted knowing that th e chi ldren were waiting for an immediate explanation josé arcadio buendía ventured a murmur “it’s the largest diamond in the world” “no” the gypsy countered “it’s ice” josé arcadio buendía wi thout unders tanding st retched ou t his hand towa rd the cake but th e giant moved it away “five reales mo re to tou ch it” he said josé arcadio buendía pai d them and put his hand on the ice and held it there for se veral minutes as his heart filled with fear and jubilation at the contact with mys tery without knowing what to say he pai d ten reales more so that his sons coul d have that p rodigious experience litt le josé arcadio refused to touch it aureliano on the other hand took a step forward and put his hand on it withdrawing it immediately “it’s boiling” he exclaimed startled but his father paid no attention to him intoxicated by the evidence of the miracle he forgot at that moment abou t the frustration of his de lirious undertakings and melquíades’ body abandoned to the appetite of the squids he paid another five reales and with his hand on the cake as if giving testimony on the ho ly scriptures he exclaimed “this is the great invention of our time” chapter whe n the pirate sir francis drake attacked riohacha in the sixteenth century úrsula iguarán’s greatgreatgrandmother became so frightened with the ringing of alarm bells and the firing of cannons that she lost control of her nerves and sa t down on a l ighted stove the burns changed her into a useless wife for the rest of her days she could only sit on one side cushioned by pillows and something strange must have happened to her way of walking for she never walked again in public she gave up all kinds of social activity obsesse d with the notion that her body gave off a singed odor dawn would find her in the courtyard for she did not dare fall asleep lest she dream of the english and their ferocious attack d ogs as they came through the windo ws of her bedroom to submit her to shameful tortures with their redhot irons her husband an aragonese merchant by whom she h ad two child ren spent h alf the value of his store on medicin es and pasti mes in an attemp t to alleviate her terror finally he sold th e business and took the family to live far from the sea in a settl ement of peaceful indians located in the foothills where he built his wife a bedroom without win dows so that the pirates o f her dream would have no way to get in in that hidden village there was a nativeborn t obacco planter who had lived there for so me time don josé arcadio buendía with whom úrsula’s gr eatgreatgrandfather established a partnership that was so lucrative that within a few years they made a fortune several centuries later the great greatgrandson of the nativeborn planter married the greatgreatgranddaughter of the aragonese therefore every time th at úrsul a became exercis ed over her husband’s mad ideas she would leap back over three hundred years of fate and curs e the day that sir francis drake had atta cked riohacha it was simply a wa y of giving herself some relief because actually they were joined till death by a bond that was more solid that love a common prick of conscience they were cousins they had grown up together in the old village that both of their ancestors wi th their work and their good habits had transformed into one of the finest towns in the province although th eir marriage was predicted from the time they had come into th e world when they exp ressed their desire to be married their own relatives tried to sto p it they we re afraid that those two healthy prod ucts of two races that ha d interbred over the cen turies would suffer the shame of breeding iguanas there had already been a horrible preceden t an aunt of úrsula’s married to an un cle of josé arcadi o buendía had a son who went thr ough life wearing loose baggy trousers and who bled to d eath after havin g lived fortytwo years in the purest sta te of virginity for he had been born and had grown up with a cartilaginous tail in the shape of a corkscrew and with a small tuft of hair on the tip a pig’s tail that was never allowed to be seen by any woman and that cost him his life when a butcher friend did him the favor of chopping it off with his cleaver josé arcadio buendía with th e whimsy of his nineteen years resolved the problem with a single phrase “i don’t care if i have piglets as long as they can talk” so they were m arried amidst a festival of fireworks and a brass ban d that went on for three days they would have been happy from then on if úrsula’s mother had not terrified her with all manner of si nister predictions about their offspring even to th e extrem e of advising her to refuse to consummate the marriage fearing that her stout and willful husband would rape her while she slept úrsula before going to bed would put on a rudimentary kind of drawers that her moth er had mad e out of sailclo th and had r einforced with a sys tem of crisscrossed leather straps and th at was closed in the front by a thick iron buckle that was how th ey lived for several months during the day h e would take care of his fighting cocks and she would do frame embroidery with her moth er at night they would wrestle for several hours in an anguished violence that s eemed to be a subs titute for the act of love until popular intuition got a whiff of something irregular and the rumor spread that úrsula was s till a virgin a year after her marriage because her husband was impotent josé arcadio buendía was the last one to hear the ru mor “look at what people are going around saying úrsula” he told his wife very calmly “let them ta lk” she said “we know that it’s not tr ue” so the situation went on the same way for another six months until that tragic sunday when josé arcadio buendía won a cockfight from prudencio agu ilar furious aroused by the blood of his bird the loser backed away from josé arcadio buendía so that everyone in the cockpit could hear what he was going to tell him “congratulations” he shouted “maybe that rooster of yours can do your wife a favor” josé arcadio buendía ser enely picked up his rooste r “i’ll be right back” he told everyone and then to prudencio aguilar “you go ho me and get a weapon because i’m going to kill you ” ten minutes later he returned with the notched sp ear that had belonged to his grandfather at the door to the cockpit where half the town had gathered prudencio agu ilar was waiti ng for him there was no time to defend himself josé arcadio buendía’s spear thrown with the strength of a bull and with the same good aim with which th e first aureliano buendía had exter minated the jaguars in the region pierced his throat that ni ght as they held a wake over the co rpse in the cockpit josé arcadio bu endía went into the b edroom as his wife was putting on her chastity pan ts pointing the spear at her he ordered “take th em off” úrsula had no doubt about her husband’s decision “you’ll be responsible for what happen s” she murmured josé arcadio buendía stuck the spear into th e dirt floor “if you bear iguanas we’ ll raise iguanas” he said “but there’ll be no more killings in this town because of you” it was a fine june night cool and with a moon and they were awake and f rolicking in bed until dawn indifferent to the breeze tha t passed through the bedroom loaded with the weeping of prudencio aguilar’s kin the matter was put down a s a duel of honor but both of them were left with a twinge in their conscience one night when she co uld not sleep úrsula went out into the courtyard to get so me water and she saw prudencio aguilar by th e water jar he wa s livid a sad expression on his face trying to cover the hole i n his throat with a plug made of esparto grass it did not bring on fear in her but pity she went back to the room and told her husband what she had seen but he did not think much of it “this just means th at we can’ t stand the wei ght of our conscience” two nights later úrsula saw prudencio aguilar again in the bathroom using the esparto plug to wash the clotted blood from his throat on another night she saw hi m strolling in the rain josé arcadio buendía annoyed by hi s wife’s hallucinations went out into the courtyard armed with the spear there was th e dead man with his sad expression “you go to hell” josé arcadio buendía shouted at him “just as many times as you come back i’ll kill you again” prudencio aguilar did not go away nor did josé arcadio buendía dare throw the spear he never slept well after that he was tormented by the immense des olation with which the d ead man ha d looked at hi m through the rain his deep nostalg ia as he year ned for living people the anxiety with which he sea rched through the house looking for some water with which to soak his esparto plug “he must be suffering a great deal” he said to úr sula “you can see that he’s so very lonely” she was so moved that the next time sh e saw the d ead man un covering the pots on th e stove sh e understood what he was looking for and from then on she placed water jugs all about the house one night when he found him washing his wound in his own room josé anedio buendía could no longer resist “it’s all right prudencio” he told hi m “we’re going to leave this town j ust as far away as we can go and we’ll never come back g o in peace n ow” that was how they undertook the cr ossing of th e mountains several friends of josé arcadio buendía young men like him excited by the a dventure dismantled their houses and packed up along with their wives an d children to head towar d the l and that no one had promised them before he left josé arcadio buendía buried the spear in the courtyard and one after the other he cut the throats of his magnificent fighting cocks trusting that in that way he coul d give some measure of peace to prudencio aguilar all that úrsula took along were a trunk with her bridal clothes a few household u tensils and the small ch est with the gold pieces th at she had in herited from her father they did not lay out any definite itinerary they simp ly tried to go in a direction opposite to the road to riohacha so that they would not leave any tra ce or meet an y people they knew it was an absurd journey after fourteen months her stomach co rrupted by monkey mea t and snake stew úrsula gave birth to a son who had all of his features human sh e had travel ed half of the trip in a hammock that two men carried on their shoulders because swelling had disfigu red her legs and her varicose veins had puffed up like bubbles although it was pitiful to see them with their sunken stomachs an d languid eyes the children survived the journey better than th eir parents and most of the time i t was fun for them one mo rning after almost two years of crossing they beca me the firs t mortals to see the western slopes of the mounta in range from the cloudy summit they saw the immense aqu atic expans e of the great s wamp as it spread out to ward the o ther side of the world but they never found the sea one night after several months of lost wandering through the swamps far away no w from the last indians they had met on their way they ca mped on the bank s of a stony river whose waters were like a torrent of frozen glass years later during the secon d civil war colonel aureliano buendía tried to follow that same route in order to take r iohacha by s urprise and after six days of traveling he understood that it was madness nevertheless the night on which they camped b eside the river his father’s host had th e look of shipwrecked people with no escape but their number had grown during the crossing and they were all prepared an d they succeeded to di e of old age josé arcadio buendía dreamed that nigh t that right there a noisy city with ho uses having mirror wails rose up he asked wha t city it was and they ans wered him with a name that he had never heard that had no meaning at all but that h ad a superna tural echo in his dream macondo on the following day he con vinced his m en that they wo uld never find the sea he ordered them to cut down the trees to make a clearing beside the rive r at the coolest spot on the bank and there they founded the village josé arcadio buendía did not succeed in decipheri ng the drea m of houses with mirror walls until the da y he discovered ice then he th ought he un derstood its deep meanin g he thought tha t in th e near future they would be able to ma nufacture blocks of ice on a large s cale from such a common material as water and with them build the new house s of the village macondo would no longer be a burning place where th e hinges and door knockers twisted with the heat bu t would be changed into a wintry city if he did n ot persevere in his attem pts to build an ice factor y it was because at tha t time he was absolutely en thusiastic over the educati on of his sons especially that of aureliano who from the first had revealed a strange intuition fo r alchemy the laboratory had been dusted off reviewing melquíades’ notes seren e now with out the exaltation of no velty i n prolonged and patient sessi ons they tried to separa te úrsula’s gold from the debris that wa s stuck t o the bottom of the pot you ng josé arcadio scarcely t ook part in the process while his father was involved body and soul with his water pipe the willful firstborn who had always been too big for his age had become a m onumental a dolescent h is voice had ch anged an incipient fuzz appeared on his upper lip one night as úrsula went into the room where he was undressing to go to bed she felt a mingled sense of shame a nd pity he was the first man th at sh e had seen n aked after h er husband and he was so wellequipped for life t hat he seem ed abnormal úrsula pre gnant for the third time relived her newlywed terror around that time a merry foulmouthed provocat ive woman ca me to the ho use to help with th e chorea and she knew h ow to read the future in cards úrsula spoke t o her about her son she thought that his disproportionate s ize was something as unnatural a s her cousin’s tail of a pig the woman let out an expansive laugh that resounded through the house like a spray of broken glass “just the opposite” she said “he’ll be very lucky” in order to confirm her pre diction she brought her cards to the house a few days later and locked herself up with josé arcadio in a granary off the kitch en she calm ly placed her cards on an old carpenter’s bench s aying anythi ng that came into her head while the boy waited beside her mo re bored than intrigued suddenly she reached out her hand and touched hi m “lordy” she said sincerel y startled and that was all she could say josé arcadio felt his bones filling up with foam a languid fear and a terrible desire to weep the woman made no insi nuations but josé arcadio kept lookin g for her all night long for the smell of smoke that she had under her armpits and that had got caug ht under his skin he wanted to be with her all the time he wanted h er to be his mo ther for them never to l eave the gra nary and for her t o say “lordy” t o him one day he could not stand it a ny more and he went looking for her at her house he made a f ormal visit sitting uncomprehendingl y in t he living room without sayi ng a word at that moment he had no d esire for her he found he r different entirely foreign to the im age that h er smell brought on as if she were someone else he drank his coffee and left the house in depression that night d uring the frightful time of lying awake he d esired h er again with a brutal anxiety but h e did not want her that time as she had been in the g ranary but as she had been that afternoon days later th e woman suddenly called him t o her house wher e she was al one with h er mother and she had him come into t he bedroom with the pretext o f showing him a deck of cards then she touched him with such freedom that he suffered a delusion after the initial shudder and he felt more fear th an pleasure she asked him to com e and see her that night he agreed in order t o get away knowi ng that he was incapable of going but that night in his burning bed he understood tha t he had to go we her even if he were not capable he got dressed by feel listening in the dark t o his brother’s calm breathing the dry cough of his father in the next room the asthma of the hens in the courtyard the buzz of the mosquitoes the beating of his heart and the inordinate bustle of a world that he had not noticed until then a nd he went ou t into th e sleeping street with all his heart he wanted th e door to be barred and not just closed as she had promised him but it was open he pushed it with the tips of his fingers and the hinges yielded with a mournful and articulate moan th at left a frozen echo inside of him from the moment he en tered sideways and trying not to make a noise he caught the smell he was still in the ha llway where the woman’s three brothers had their hammocks i n positions that he could not see and th at he coul d not determine in the darkness as he felt his way along the hall to push open the bedr oom door and get his bearings there so as not to mistake the bed he found it he bumped agai nst the ropes of the hammocks which were lower than he h ad suspected and a man who had been snoring until then turned in his sleep and said in a kind of delusion “it was wednesday” when he pushed open the bedroom door he could not prevent it from scraping against the uneven floor suddenly in the absolute darkness he understood with a hopel ess nostal gia that he was completely disoriented sleeping in the narrow roo m were the mother another daughter with her hu sband and two children and the wo man who m ay not h ave been there he could have guided himself by the smell if the smell had not been all over the house so devious and at the sa me time so d efinite as it had always b een on his skin he did not move for a long time wondering in fright how he had ever got to that abys s of abandonment when a hand with all its fingers extended and feeling about in the da rkness touched his face he was not surprised for without knowing he had been expecting it then he gave himself over to that hand and in a terrible state of exhaustion he let himself be led to a shap eless place wh ere his cloth es were taken off and he was heaved about like a sack of potatoes and thr own from one side to the other in a bottomless darkness in which his arms were useless where it no longer smelled of woman but of ammonia and where he tried to rememb er her face and found befo re him the face of úrsula confusedly aware tha t he was doing something that for a v ery long tim e he h ad wa nted to do b ut that he h ad imagined could really never be done not kn owing what h e was doing because he did not know where his feet were or where his head was or w hose feet or wh ose head an d feeling that he could n o longer resist the glacial ru mbling of his kidneys and the air of his intestines and fear and the bewildered anxiety to flee and at the same time stay forever in th at exasperated sil ence and tha t fearful solitude her name was pilar ternera she had been part of the exodus that end ed with the fou nding of macondo dragged along by her family in order to separate her from the man who had raped her at fourteen and had continued to love her until she was twen tytwo but who never made up his mind to make the situation public because he was a ma n apart he promised to follow her to the ends of the earth but only later on when he put his affairs in order and she had become tired of waiting for him always identifying him with the tall and shor t blond and brunet men that her card s promised from land and sea within three days three months or three years with her waiting she had lost the strength of her thighs the firmness of her breasts her habit of tenderness but she kept the madness of her heart intact mad dened by that prodigious plaything josé arcadio followed her path ev ery night through the labyrinth of the room on a cert ain occasion he found the door barred and he knocked several times knowing that if he had th e boldness to knock the first time he would have had to kno ck until the la st and after an intermi nable wait she opened th e door for him during the day lying down to dream he would s ecretly enjo y the memories of the night before but when sh e came into the house m erry indifferent chatty he did not have to mak e any effort to hide his tension because that woman whos e explosive laugh frightened off the doves had nothing to do with the invisible power that taught him how to br eathe from within and control his heartbeats and that had per mitted him to understan d why man ar e afraid of death he was so wrap ped up in himself that he did not even understa nd the joy of everyone when his father and his brother aroused the household with the n ews that they had succeed ed in penetrating the metallic debris and had separated úrsula’s gold they had su cceeded as a matter of fact after putting in complicated and p ersevering days at it úrsula was happy and sh e even gave thanks to g od for the invention of alchemy while the people of the village crushed into the laboratory and they served them guava jelly on crackers to celebrate the wonder and josé arcadio buendía let them see the crucible with the reco vered gold as if he had just invented it showing it all around he ended up in front of his older son who during the past few days ha d barely put in an appea rance in the laboratory he put the dry and yellowish mass in front of his e yes and asked him “what does it l ook like to you” josé arca dio answered sincerely “dog shit” his father gave him a blow with the back of hi s hand that brought out blood and tears that night pilar t ernera put arnica compresses on the s welling feeling about for the bottle and cotton in the dark and she did everything she wanted with him as long as it did not bother him making a n effort to love him witho ut hurting him they re ached such a state of inti macy that la ter withou t realizing it they were whispering to each other “i want to b e alone with you” he said “one of these days i’ m going to tell everybody and we can stop all of this sneaking around” she did not try to calm hi m down “that would be fine” she said “if w e’re alone we’ll leave the lamp lighted so that we can see each oth er and i can h oller as much as i want without anybody’s having to butt in and you ca n whisper in my ear any cra p you can thi nk of” that convers ation the biting rancor that he felt against his father and the imminent possibility of wild love inspired a serene courage in him in a spontaneous way without any preparati on he told everything to his brother at first you ng aureliano understoo d only th e risk the imm ense possibility of danger that his brother’s adventures implied and he could not un derstand the fascination of the subject little by little he beca me contami nated with the anxiety he wondered about the details of th e dangers he identified himself with the suffering and enjoyment of his brother he felt frightened and happy he would stay a wake waiting for him until dawn in the solitary bed that seemed to have a bottom of live coals and th ey would keep on talking until it was ti me to get up so that bo th of them so on suffered from the same drowsiness felt the same lack of interest in alchemy and th e wisdom of their father and they too k refuge in solitude “those kids are out of their heads” úrsula said “they must hav e worms” she prepared a repugnant potion for them made ou t of mashed wormseed which they both drank with unforeseen stoicism and they sat do wn at the same time o n their pots eleven times in a single d ay expelling some rosecolored parasites that they showed to everybody with great jubilation for it allowed them to decei ve úrsula as to the origin of their distractions and drowsiness aureliano not only understood by then he also lived his brother’s experiences as something of his own for on one occasio n when the l atter was ex plaining in great detail th e mechanis m of love he interrupted him to ask “what does it feel like” josé arcadio gave an immediate reply “it’s like an earthquake” one january thursday at two o’clock in the morn ing amaranta was born before anyo ne came into the room úrsula examined her carefully she was light and watery like a newt but all of her parts were human aureliano did not notice the n ew thing except when the house b ecame full of people protected by the confusion he went off in se arch of his brother who had not been in bed since eleven o’clock and it was such an impulsive decision tha t he did n ot even have time to ask himself how he could get him ou t of pilar tern era’s bedroom he circl ed the hous e for several hours whistling private calls until the proximity of dawn forced him to go home in his mother’s room playing with the newborn little sister and with a face that drooped wi th innocence he found josé arcadio úrsula was barely over her for ty days’ rest when the gypsies returned they were the same acrobats an d jugglers that had brought the i ce unlike melquíades’ tribe they ha d shown very quickly that they were not heralds of progress but purveyors of amusement even when they brought the ice they did not advertise it for its us efulness in the life of man but as a simple circus curiosity this time along with many other arti fices they bro ught a flying carpet but they did no t offer it as a fundamenta l contributio n to the d evelopment o f transport rather as an object of recreation t he people at once dug up their last gold pieces to take advantage of a quick flight over the houses of the village protected by the delightful cover of collective dis order josé arcadio and pilar passed many relaxing hours they were two happy lovers among th e crowd and they even came to sus pect tha t love could be a feeling that was more relaxing and deep than the happiness wild but m omentary o f their secret nights pila r however broke the spell stimulated b y the enthusiasm that josé arcadio showed in her companionship she conf used the form and th e occasion and all of a sudden she threw the whole world on top of him “now you really are a man” she told him and since h e did not understand wh at she meant she spelled it out to him “you’re goin g to be a father” josé arcadio did not dar e leave the house for se veral days it was enough for him to hear th e rocking laughter of pilar in the kitchen to run and take refuge in the laboratory where the artifacts of alchemy h ad come alive again wi th úrsula’s blessing josé arcadio buen día received hi s errant so n with joy and initiated him in the search for the philosopher’s stone which he had finally undertaken one afterno on the boys grew enthusi astic over th e flying carpet th at went swiftly by th e laborator y at window level carrying the gypsy who was driving it and several children from the village who were merrily waving their hands but josé arcadio buendía did not even look at it “let them dream” he said “we’ll do better flyi ng than they are doing an d with mor e scientific resources tha n a miserable bedspread” in spite of his feigned interest jo sé arcadio must unders tood the p owers of the philosopher’s egg which to him looked like a poorly blown bottle he did not succeed in escaping from his wo rries he lost his appetite and he could not sleep he fell into an ill humor t he same as his father’s over the failure of his undertakings and such was his upset that josé arcadio buendía himself relieved him of his duties in the laborator y thinking that he had taken alchemy too much to heart aureliano of course understood that his brother’s affliction did not have its source in the search for the philosopher’s stone but he could not get into his confidence he had lost his former spontaneity from an accomplice and a communi cative person he had become wi thdrawn and hostile anxious for solitude bitten b y a virulent r ancor against the world one night he left his bed as usual but he did not go to pilar ternera’s house but to mingle is the tumult of t he fair after wandering about among all kinds of contraptions with out becoming interested in any of them he spotted som ething that was not a part of it all a very young gypsy girl almost a child who was weighted down by beads and was the most beautiful woman that josé arcadio had ever seen in his life she was in the crowd that was witnessing th e sad spectacle of the man who ha d been turned into a snake for having disobeyed his parents josé arcadio paid no attention while the sad in terrogation of th e snakeman was taking pl ace he made his way through the crowd up to the front row where the gypsy girl was and he stooped behind her he pressed against her back the girl tried to separate herself but josé arcadio pressed more strongly against her back then she felt hi m she remained motionless against him trembling with surprise and fear unable to believe the evidence and finally she turned her head a nd looked at him with a tremulous smile at that in stant two gypsies put the snakeman into his cage and carried him into the tent the gypsy who was conducting the show ann ounced “and now l adies and gentlemen we are going to show the ter rible test of the woman who must have her head chopped off every night at this time for one hundred and fifty years as pu nishment for having se en what she should not have” josé arcadio and the gyp sy girl did not witn ess the decapitati on they went to her tent wher e they kissed each o ther with a d esperate anxiety while they took off their clothes t he gypsy girl removed the starched la ce corsets she had on and there she was changed i nto practicall y nothing she was a languid little frog with incipient breasts and legs so thin that they did not even match th e size of josé arcadio’s arms but she had a decision and a warmth that compensated for her fragility nevertheless josé arcad io could not respond to her because they were in a kind of public tent where th e gypsies passed through with their circus things an d did their b usiness and would even tarry by the bed for a ga me of dice the lamp ha nging from the cen ter po le lighted the whole place up during a pause in the caresses josé arcadio stretched out naked on the bed with out knowing what to do while the girl tried to inspire him a gypsy woma n with splen did flesh ca me in a shor t time after accompanied by a ma n who was not of the carav an bu t who was not from the village either and they both began to undress in front of the bed without meani ng to the woman looked at josé arca dio and examined his magnificent an imal in repose with a kind of pathetic fervor “my boy” she exclaimed “may god preserve you just as you a re” josé arcadio’s companion asked them to leave them alone and the cou ple lay down on the ground close to th e bed the passion of the oth ers woke up josé arcadi o’s fervor on the first contact the b ones of the g irl seemed to become disj ointed with a disorderly crunch like the sound of a box of do minoes and her skin broke out into a pale sweat and her eyes filled with tears as her whole body exhaled a lugubrious lament and a vagu e smell of mud but she bore the impact with a firmness of character an d a bravery that were ad mirable josé arcadio felt himself lifted up into th e air toward a state of seraphic inspiration where hi s heart burst forth with an outpouring of tender obscenities that entered the girl through her ears and cam e out of her mouth translated into her language it was thursday on saturday night jo sé arcadio wrapped a r ed cloth around his head and left with the gypsies when úrsula discovered his absenc e she searched for him all through the village in the remains of the gyps y camp ther e was nothing but a ga rbage pit a mong the still smokin g ashes of the extinguished campfires someone who was there l ooking for beads among the trash told úrsula that the night before he had seen her son in the tumult of the caravan pushing the snakeman’s cage on a cart “he’s become a gypsy” she shouted to her husband who had not shown the slightest sign of alarm over the disappear ance “i hope it’s true” josé arcadio buendía said gr inding in his mortar th e material that had been ground a thousand times and reheated and ground again “that way he’ll learn to be a man” úrsula asked where the gypsies had gone she went al ong asking and following the road s he had b een shown thinking that she still had time to catch up to them she kept getting farther away from the village until she felt so far away that she did not think about returning josé arcadio buendía did not discover that his wife was missing until eight o’cloc k at night when he left the material warming in a bed of manure and went to see wha t was wrong wi th little amaranta wh o was gettin g hoarse from crying in a few hours he gather ed a group of w ellequipped men put amaranta in the hands of a woman who offered to nurse her and was lost on invisible paths in pur suit of úrsula aureliano went with th em some indian fishermen whose language they could not understand told them with signs that th ey had no t seen anyone pass after th ree days of useless searching they returned to the village for several weeks josé arcadio buendía let himself be overcome by consternation he took care of little ama ranta like a mother he bathed and d ressed her took her to be nursed four times a day and even san g to her at n ight the son gs that úrsula never knew how to si ng on a cer tain occasion pilar ternera volunteered to do the household c hores until úrsula came back aureliano whos e mysterious intuition had become sh arpened with the misfortune felt a glow of clairvoyance when he saw her com e in then he knew tha t in some inex plicable way she was to blame for his brother’s flight and t he consequent disappearance of his mother and he harassed her with a silent an d implacable h ostility in such a way th at the woman d id not return to the house time put things in their place josé arcadio bue ndía and his son did not know exactly when they returned to the laboratory dusting things lighting the water pi pe involved once more in the patient manipulation of the material that had been sleepin g for several months in its bed of manure even amaranta lying in a wicker basket observed with cu riosity the absorbing work of her father and her brother in the small room where the air was rarefied by mercury vapors on a certain occasion months after úrsu la’s d eparture strange things began to happen an empty flask that had been forgotten in a cupboard for a long time became so heavy that i t could not be moved a pan of water on the worktable boiled without any fire under it for a half hour until it completely eva porated jos é arcadio buendía and his son observed those phenomena with startled excitement unabl e to explain them but in terpreting them as predictions of th e material one day amaranta’s ba sket began to move by itself and made a comp lete turn about th e room to the consternation of auer liano who hurried to stop it but his father did not get upset he put the b asket in its place and tied i t to the leg of a table convinced that the longawaited event was imm inent it wa s on that occasion that auerliano heard him say “if you don’t fear god fear him through the metal s suddenly almost five months after her disappe arance úrsula came b ack she arrived exalted rejuvenated with new clothes in a style that was unknown in the village josé arcadio buendía could barely stand up under the impact “that was it” he shouted “i knew it was going to happen” and he really bel ieved it for during his prolonged imprisonment as he man ipulated the material he begged in the depth of his heart that the longed for miracle should not be the disco very of the philosopher’s stone or t he freeing of the breath that makes metals live or the faculty to convert the hinges and the locks of the house into gold but wh at had just happened úrsula’s return but she did not share his excitem ent she gave hi m a conventiona l kiss as if she had been away only an hour and she told him “look out the door” josé arcadio buendía took a long time to get o ut of his perplexity when he went ou t into th e street and saw th e crowd they were not gypsie s they were men and women like them wi th straight hair and dark skin who spoke the same la nguage and complained of the same pains they had mules l oaded down with things to ea t oxcar ts with furniture and d omestic u tensils pure and simple earthl y accessories put on sale without any fuss by peddlers of everyday reality they came from the other side of the swamp o nly two da ys away wh ere there were towns that received mail every month in the year and where they were familia r with the implements of good living úrsu la had not caug ht up with the gypsies b ut she h ad found the route th at her husband had been unable to discover in his frustrated search for the great inventions chapter pilar ter nera’s son was brought to his grand parents’ ho use two week s after he wa s born úrsula admitted hi m grudgingly conquered once more by the obstinacy of her husband who could not tolerate the idea that an offshoot of his blood shou ld be adrift but he imposed the condition that the child sh ould never know his true identity alt hough he was given the name josé arcadio they ended up calling him simply arcadio so as to av oid confusion at that time there was so much activity in th e town and s o much bustle in the house that th e care of the ch ildren was relegated to a secondary level they were put in the care of visi tación a guajiro indian woman who had arrived in town with a brother in flight fr om a plague of insomnia that ha d been scourging their tribe for several years they were both so docile and willin g to help th at úrsula to ok them on to help her with her household chores that was how arcadio and amaranta ca me to speak the guajiro language before spanish and they lear ned to drin k lizard broth and eat spider eggs without úrsula’s knowing it for she was too busy with a promising business in candy animals macondo had changed the people who had come with úrsula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its privileged p osition with respect to the swamp so that from the narrow village of past times it changed into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent commercial route over which the first arabs arrived with thei r baggy pants and rings in their ears swapping glass beads for macaws jos é arcadio buendía did not have a mom ent’s rest fa scinated b y an immediate reality tha t came to b e more fantastic than the vast universe of his imagination he lost all interest in the alchemist’s laboratory put to rest the material that had become a ttenuated with months o f manipulation and went back to bein g the enterp rising man of earlier days when he h ad decided upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one would enjo y privileges that everyone did not have he acquired such authority among the new arrivals that foundations were not laid or walls b uilt without his being consulted and it was d ecided that h e should be the one in charge of the distribution of the land wh en the acrob at gypsies returned with their vagabond carnival transformed now into a giga ntic organization of games of luck and chance they were received with great joy for it was thou ght that josé arcadio wo uld be comi ng back with them but j osé arcadio did not return nor did th ey com e with the sn akeman who according to what úrsula thought was the only one who could te ll them about their son so the gypsies were no t allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in the future for they were considered th e bearers o f concupiscence and perversion josé arcadio buendía however was explicit in maintaining that the old tribe of melquíades who had contributed so much to the growth of the village with his ageold wisdom and his fabulous inventions would alwa ys find the gates open but melquíades’ tribe according to what the wanderers sai d had been wiped off the face of th e earth b ecause they had gone beyond the limits of human knowledge emancipated for the mo ment a t least from the torment of fantasy josé arcadio buendía in a short time s et up a system of order a nd work wh ich allowed for only one bit of license the freeing of the birds which since the time o f the founding had made time merry with their flutes and installing in their place musical clocks in ever y house they were wondr ous clocks made of car ved wood which the arabs had traded for macaws and which josé arcadio buendía had synchronized with such precision that every half hour the town grew merry with the progressive chords of the same song until it reached the climax of a noontim e that was as exact and unanimous as a complete waltz it was also josé arcadi o buendía who d ecided during those years that they s hould plant almond trees instead of acacias on the streets and who discovered without ever revealing it a way to make them live forever many years later when macondo was a field of wooden houses with zinc roofs the broken and dusty almond trees still st ood on the oldest streets although no one knew who had planted them while his father was putti ng the to wn in order and his mother was increasing their wealth with her ma rvelous business of cand ied little roo sters and fish which left the house twice a da y strung along sticks of balsa wood aureliano spent inter minable hours in the abandoned laboratory learning the art of silv erwork by his own experimentation he had shot up so fast that in a short time the clothing left behind by his brother no long er fit him and he began to wear his father’s but visitación ha d to sew pleats in th e shirt and darts i n the p ants because aureliano ha d not sequined the corpulence of the others adolescen ce had taken away the softness of his voice and had made him silent and definitely solitary but on the other hand it had restored the intens e expression that he had had in his eyes when he was born he concentrated so much on his experiments in silverwork that h e scarcely left the l aboratory to eat worried ever his inner withdrawal josé arcadio buendía gave him the keys to the ho use and a little money th inking that perhaps he n eeded a wo man but au reliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepa re some aqu a regia and he beautified th e keys by pla ting them with gold his excesses wer e hardly co mparable to those of ar cadio and amaranta who had already begun to get their second teeth and still went about all day clutching at the indians’ cloaks stu bborn in their decision not to speak spanish but the guajiro language “you shouldn’t complain” úr sula told her husband “children inherit their parents’ madness” and as she was lamenting her mi sfortune convinced that the wild behavior of her children was somethi ng as fearful as a pig’s tail aureliano gave her a look that wrapped her in an atmosphere of uncertainty “somebody is coming” he told her úrsula as she did whenever he made a prediction tried to break it down with her housewifely logic it was normal for someone to be coming dozens of strangers came through mac ondo every day without arousing suspicion or se cret ideas nevertheless beyond all log ic aureliano was sure of his prediction “i don’t kno w who it will be” he insisted “but whoever it is is already on the way” that sunday in fact rebeca arrived she was onl y eleven year s old she had made the difficult trip from manaure with some hide dealers who h ad taken on the task of delivering her along with a letter to josé arcadio buendía but they could not explain precisely who the person was who had asked the favor her entire baggage consisted of a small trunk a little rocking chair with small hand painted flowers and a canvas sack which kept making a cloccloccloc sound where she carried her parents’ bones the letter addressed to josé arca dio buendía was written is very warm terms by someone who still loved him very mu ch in spite of time and distan ce and who felt obliged by a basic humanitarian feeling to do the charitable thing and send him that poor unsheltered orphan who was a second cous in of úrsula’s and conseque ntly also a relative of josé arcadio buendía although farther removed because sh e was the da ughter of that unforgetta ble friend nicanor ulloa and his very worthy wife rebeca montiel may go d keep them in his holy kingdom whose remains the girl was carrying so that they might be given christian burial the names mention ed as well a s the signature on the letter were perfectly legible but neither josé arcadio buendía nor úrsula remembered having any relatives with those nam es nor did they know anyone by the name of the sender of the letter much less the remote village of manaure it was impossible to obtain any further information from the girl from the moment she a rrived she had been sittin g in the rocker sucking her finger and observing everyone with h er larg e startled eyes with out giving any sign of understanding what they were asking her she wore a diagonally striped dress that had been dyed black worn by use and a pair of scaly patent leat her boots her hair was held behind her ears with bows of black ribbon she wore a scapular with th e images worn away by sweat and on her right wrist the fang of a carniv orous animal mounted on a backing of copper as an amulet against the evil eye her greenish skin her stomach round and te nse as a dr um revealed poor health and hunger that were ol der than sh e was but when they gav e her som ething to eat s he kept the plate on her knees witho ut tasting an ything they even began to think that she was a d eafmute until the indians asked her in their language if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes as if she recognized them and sai d yes with her head they kept h er because there was nothing else they could do they decided to call her rebeca which accor ding to the letter was her mother’s name because aureliano had the patience to read to her the names of all the saints and he did not g et a reaction from any one of them since there wa s no cemetery in macondo at that time for no one had died up til l then they k ept the bag of bones to wait for a worthy place of burial and for a long time it got in the wa y everywhere a nd would be found where least expected always with its clucki ng of a broody hen a long time passed before rebeca b ecame incorporated into the life of the fa mily she would sit in her small rocker sucking her finger in the most remote corner of the house nothing attracted her atten tion except the music of the clocks which she would look for every half hour with her frightened eyes as if she hoped to find it someplace in the air they could n ot get her to eat for several days no one understood why she had not died of hunger until the indi ans who we re aware of everything for they went ceaselessly about the ho use on their stealthy feet discovered that rebeca o nly liked to eat the d amp earth of the courtyard an d the cake o f whitewash that she pick ed of the wa lls with her nails it was obvious that her parents or whoever had raised her had scolde d her for that habit beca use she did it secretively and with a feeling of guilt tryi ng to put awa y supplies so th at she could eat when n o one was looking from then on they put her under an implacable watch they threw cow gall onto the courtyard and rubbed hot chili on the walls thinki ng they could defeat her pernicious vice with those m ethods but she showed such signs of a stuteness an d ingenuity to find som e earth that úrsula found herself forced to use more drastic methods she put some orange juice and rhubarb into a pan th at she left in the dew all n ight and she gave her the dose the following day on an empty stomach although no one had told her that it was the sp ecific remedy for the vice of eating earth she thought that any bitter substance in an emp ty stomach would have to make the liver react rebeca was so rebellious and strong in spite of her fra ilness that they had to tie her up like a calf to make her swallow the m edicine and they could b arely keep b ack her kicks or bear up under the strange hieroglyphics that she alter nated with her bites and spi tting and th at according to wha t the scandalized i ndians said were the vilest obscenities that one could ever imagine in their language when úrsula discovered that she added whipping to the treatment it was never estab lished whether it was the rhuba rb or the beatings that h ad effect or both of them together but the truth was that in a few weeks rebeca b egan to show signs of recovery she took part in the games o f arcadio and amaran ta who trea ted her like an o lder sister a nd she a te heartily using the u tensils properly it was soon revealed that s he spoke spanis h with as much fluency as the ind ian language that she had a remarkable ability for manual work and that she could sing the waltz of the clocks with some very funny words that she herself had inve nted it did not take long for them to consider her anoth er memb er of the family she was m ore affectio nate to úrs ula than any of her own children had been and s he called arcadio and am aranta bro ther and sister aureliano uncle and josé arcadio buendía grandpa so that she finally deserved as much as the others the name of rebeca buen día the only one that sh e ever had an d that she bor e with dignity until her death one night about the tim e that reb eca was cured of the vice of eating earth and was b rought to sleep in the other children’s room the indian woman who slept with them awoke by chance and heard a stra nge intermittent sound i n the corner she got up in alarm thinking that an animal ha d come into the room and then she s aw rebeca in the rocker sucking her finger and with her eye s lighted up in the darknes s like those of a cat t errified exhausted by h er fate visita ción recognized in those eyes the symptoms of the sickness whose threat ha d obliged her and her brother to exil e themselves forever from an ageold kingdom wher e they had b een prince a nd princess it was the insomnia plague cataure the indian was gone from the house by morning his sister stayed because her fatalisti c heart told her that the lethal sickness would follow her no matter what to the farthest corner of the earth no on e understood visitación’s alarm “if we don’t ever sleep again so much the b etter” josé arcadio buendía said in good humor “that wa y we can get more out of life” but the indian woman explained that th e most fearsome part of the sickness of insomnia was not the impossibility of sleeping for the body did not feel any fatigue at all but its inexorable evolution toward a more critical mani festation a l oss of mem ory she meant tha t when the sick p erson becam e used to his state of vigil the recollection of his childhood bega n to be erased from his memory then the name and notion of things and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of his own being until he sank into a kind of idiocy that had no past josé arcadio buendía dying with laughter thought that it was just a question of one of th e many illnesses invented by the indians’ supersti tions but úrsula just to be safe took the precaut ion of isolating rebeca from the other children after several weeks when visitación’s terror seem ed to have died down josé arcadio buendía found himself rollin g over in bed unable to fall asleep úrsula who had al so awakened asked him what was wrong and he answered “i’m thinking about prudencio aguilar again” they did no t sleep a minute but the following day they felt so rested th at they forgot about the bad night aureliano commented with surprise at lunchtime th at he felt very well in spite of the fact that he had spent the whole night in the laborato ry gilding a br ooch that he planned to give to úrsula for her birthday they did not b ecome alarm ed until the third day when no one felt sleepy at b edtime an d they realized that th ey had gone more than fifty hours without sleeping “the children are awake too” the indian said with her fatalistic conviction “once it gets into a house no one can escape the plague” they had indeed contracted the illness of insomn ia úrsula who had learned from her mother the medicina l value of plants prepared and made them all drink a brew of monkshood but they could not get to sleep an d spent the whole day dr eaming on their feet in that sta te of hallucinated lucidity not only did they see the imag es of thei r own dreams but some sa w the images dreamed b y others it was as if the house were full of visitors sitting in her rocker in a corner of the kitchen rebeca drea med tha t a man who looked very m uch lik e her dressed in white linen an d with his sh irt collar closed by a gold button was bringing he r a bouquet of roses he was accompanied by a woman with delicate h ands who took out one ros e and put it i n the child’s hair úrsula understood that the m an and wom an were rebeca’s paren ts but even though she made a great effort to recognize them she confirmed her certainty tha t she had never seen them in the meantime through an oversight that josé arcadi o buendía ne ver forgave himself for the candy a nimals made in the house were still being sold in the town children and adults sucked with delight on the delicious little green roosters of insomnia the exquisi te pink fish of insomnia and the tender yello w ponies of insomnia so that dawn on monday foun d the whol e town awak e no one was alarmed at first on the contrary they were h appy at not sleep ing because there was so much to do in macon do in those days that there was barely enough time they worked so hard that soon they had nothing else to d o and they could be found at three o’cloc k in the m orning with their arms crossed counting the notes in the waltz of the clock t hose who wan ted to sl eep not from fatigue but because of th e nostalgia for dreams tried all kinds of method s of exhausting themselves they would gather together to converse endlessly to tell over and ov er for hours on end the sa me jokes to complicate to the limits of exasperation the s tory about the capon which was an endless game i n which the narrator asked if they wa nted him to tell them the story about the capo n and when th ey answered yes the narrator would say that he ha d not asked them to say yes but whether they wa nted him to tell them the story about the capon and when they answered no the narrator told them that he had not asked them to say no but whether they wanted him to tell them the st ory about the capon and when they r emained silent the narrator told them that he had not asked them to rema in silent but whether they wanted him to tell th em the story abo ut the capo n and no one could leave b ecause th e narrator would say that he had not a sked them to leave but whether they wanted him to tell them the story abo ut the cap on and so on a nd on in a vicious circle that lasted en tire nights when josé arcadio buendía realized that the pla gue had invaded the town he gathered together the heads of families to explain to them what he knew about the sickness of insomnia and they agreed on m ethods to pr event the scourge from sp reading to other towns in the swa mp that wa s why they to ok the bells off the goats bells that the arabs ha d swapped them for macaws and put them at the entrance to town at th e disposal of those who would not listen to the advice and entreaties of the sentinel s and insisted on visiti ng the town all strangers who passed through the streets of macondo at th at time had to ring their bells so that the sick people would know that they were healthy they were not allowed to eat or dr ink anything during their stay for th ere was n o doubt but that the illness was tran smitted by mou th and all food and drink had been contaminated by insomnia in tha t way they kept th e plague re stricted to the perimeter o f the to wn so effective was the quarantine that the day came when the emergency situation was a ccepted as a natural thing and life was organized in such a way that work pi cked up its r hythm again and no one worried an y more about the useless habit of sleeping it was aureliano who con ceived the formula that was to protect them against loss of memory for several months he discovered it by chance an expe rt insomniac having been one of the first he had learned the art of silverwork to perfection one day he was look ing for the small anvil that he used for la minating metals and he could not reme mber its name his father told him “stake” aureliano wr ote the name on a piece of paper that he pasted to the bas e of the small anvi l stake in that way h e was sure of not forgetting it in the fu ture it did n ot occur to him that this was th e first manifestatio n of a loss of memory because the o bject had a d ifficult name to remember but a few days later be discovered that he had trouble remembering almost every object in the laboratory then he mar ked them wi th their respective names so that all h e had to do was read the inscription in order to identify them when his father told him about his alarm at ha ving forgott en even the most impressive happenings of his childhood aureliano explained his method to him and josé arcadio buendía put it i nto practi ce all through the house an d later on imposed it o n the whole village with an inked brush he marked everything with its name table chai r clock door wall bed pan he wen t to the corral an d marked th e animals an d plants cow goat pig hen cassava caladium banana little by little studying the infinite possibilities of a loss of memory he realized that the day might come wh en things would be recognized by th eir inscriptions but tha t no on e would remember thei r use then he was more explicit the sign that he hung on th e neck of th e cow was a n exemplar y proof of the way in which the inhabitants of ma condo were prepared to fight against loss of memory this is the cow she must be mil ked every morning so that she will produc e milk and the milk must be boiled in order to be mixed wi th coffee to make coffee and milk thus they wen t on living in a reality that was slipping away momentar ily captured by words but which would escape irremediably when they forgot the values of the written letters at the beginning of the road into the swamp they put up a sign that said macondo and another larger one on the main street that sai d god exi sts in all the houses keys to memorizing objects and feelings had been written but the system dem anded so much vigilance and moral strength tha t many succu mbed to the spell of an imaginary reality one invented by th emselves which was les s practical for them but more comforting pilar ternera was the one who contributed most to popularize that mystification when she conceived th e trick of reading the past in cards as she had read the future before by means of that recourse the insomniacs began to live in a world built on the uncertain alternatives of the cards where a fa ther was remembered faintly as the dark man who had arrived at the beginning of april and a mo ther was rem embered only as the dark woman who wore a gold ring on her le ft hand and where a bi rth date was reduced to the last tuesday on which a lark sang in the laurel tree defeated by those pr actices of con solation josé arcadio b uendía then decided to build the memory machi ne that he ha d desired once in order to remember the marvelous inventions of the gypsies the artifact was based on the possibility of review ing every morning from beginning to end the to tality of knowledge acqu ired during one’s life he conceived of it as a spinning dict ionary that a person placed on the axis could ope rate by means of a lever so that in a very few hours there would pass before his eyes the no tions most necessary for life he had succeeded in writing almost fourteen thousand entries when along the road from the swamp a strangelooking old man with the sad sleepers’ bell appeared carrying a bulging suitcase tied with a rope and pulling a cart covered with black cloth he went str aight to the house of josé arcadio buendía visitación did not recognize him when she opened the door and she thought he had come with the idea of selling something unaware that nothi ng could be sold in a town that was sinking irrevocably into the quicksand of forgetfulness he was a decrepit man alt hough his voice was also broken by uncertainty an d his hands seemed to doubt the existence of thin gs it was evident tha t he came from the world where men could still sleep and remember josé arcadio buendía found him sitting in the living room fanning himself with a patched bla ck hat as he read with compassionate attention the signs pasted to the walls he greeted him with a broad show of affection afraid that h e had known him at another time and that he did not remember him now but the visitor was aware of his falseness he felt himself forgotten no t with the irrem ediable forgetfulness of the heart but with a different kind of forgetfulness which was more cruel a nd irrevocable and which he knew ver y well because it was the forgetfulness of death then he understood he opened the suitcas e crammed wi th indecipherable objects and from a mong then he took out a little case with man y flasks he ga ve josé arcadio buendía a drink of a gentle color and the light went on in his memory his eyes b ecame moist from weepin g even befo re he noti ced himself in an absurd l iving room where objects were labeled and before he was ashame d of the s olemn nonsense written o n the walls and even bef ore he recognized the n ewcomer with a dazzling glow of joy it was melquíades while macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory josé a rcadio buendía and melquíades dusted off their old friendship the gypsy was incli ned to sta y in the town he really ha d been throug h death bu t he had returned because he could no t bear th e solitude repud iated by his tribe having lost all of his supernatural faculties be cause of his fa ithfulness to life he decid ed to take refuge in that corner of the world which had still not been discovered by death dedicated to the operation of a daguerreotype laboratory josé arca dio buend ía had never heard of that invention but when h e saw himself and his whole family fastened onto a sheet of iridescent metal for an eternity he was mute wi th stupef action that wa s the da te of the oxid ized daguerreotype in which josé arcadio buendía ap peared with his bristly an d graying hair his card board collar attached to his shirt by a copper button and an ex pression of st artled solemnity whom úrsula described dying with laughter as a “frightened gener al” josé arcadi o buendía was in fact frightened on that dea r decemb er morning when the daguerr eotype was made for he was thinkin g that people were slowly wearing away while his image would endure an a metallic plaque through a curious reversal of custom it was úrsula who got that i dea out of h is head as it was also sh e who forgot her ancient bitterness an d decided th at melquíades would stay on in the h ouse although she never permitted them to m ake a daguerreotype of her because a ccording to her very words she did not want to survive as a laughingstock for her grandchildren th at morning she dressed the children in their best clothes powdered their faces and gave a spoonful of marrow syrup to each one so that they would all remain a bsolutely m otionless during the nea rly two min utes in front of melquíades fantastic camera in the family da guerreotype the only on e that ever existed aureliano appeared dressed i n black velvet between am aranta and rebeca h e had the sa me la nguor and the same clairvoyant loo k that he would have years later as h e faced the firing squa d but he s till had not sensed the premonition of his fate he was an expert silve rsmith praised all over the swampland for the delicacy of his work in the workshop which he s hared with melquíades’ mad laboratory he coul d barely be heard breathing he seemed to be taking refuge in some other ti me while his father and the gypsy wi th shouts interpreted the predictions of nostradam us amidst a noise of flasks and trays and the disaster of spille d acids and silver bromide th at was lost in the twists and turns it gave at every instant that dedica tion to his work the g ood judgment with which he directed his attention had allowed aureliano to earn in a short time more money tha n úrsula had with her delicious cand y fauna but everybody th ought it strange that he was now a fullgrown man and had not known a woman it was true that he had never had one several mon ths later s aw the return o f francisco the man as ancient vagab ond who wa s almost two hundred years old and who frequently pass ed through macondo di stributing songs that he composed hi mself in them francisco the man tol d in great detail the thing s that had h appened in the towns along his route from manaure to the edge of the swamp so that if anyone had a message to send or an event to m ake public he would pay him two cen ts to include it in his repertory that was how úr sula learned of the death of her mother as a simple conseq uence of listening to the songs in the hope that they would say something a bout her son josé arcadio francisco the man called that b ecause he h ad once defea ted the d evil in a duel of improvisation and whose real name no one knew disappeared from ma condo during th e insomnia plague and one night he appeared suddenly in catarino’s store the whole town went to listen to him to find out what h ad happened in the world on that occasion there a rrived with him a woman who was so fat that four indians had to carry her in a rocking chair and an adolescent m ulatto girl with a forlorn look who protected her from the su n with an u mbrella aureliano wen t to catarino’s store that night he found francisco the man like a monolith ic chameleo n sitting in the midst of a circle of bystanders he was singing the news with his old ou toftune voice accompa nying himself with the sa me archai c accordion tha t sir walter raleigh had given him in the guianas an d keeping time with his great walking feet that were cracked from saltpeter in front of a door at the rear through which men were going and coming the matron of th e rocking chair was sittin g and fanning herself in silence catari no with a felt rose behind his ear was selling the gatherin g mugs of fermented cane juice and he took advantage of the o ccasio n to go over to th e men and put his hand on them where he should not have toward midnight the heat was unbearable aureliano listened to the news to the end without hearing anything that wa s of interest to his fa mily he was g etting ready to go home when the matron signaled him with her hand “you go in too” she told him “it only costs twenty cents” aureliano th rew a coin i nto the hop per that the matron had in her lap an d went in to the room without kno wing why the adolescen t mulatto girl with her s mall bitch’s teats was na ked on the bed before aureliano sixtythree men had passed through the room that night from being used so much kneaded with swea t and sighs the air in the room had begun to turn to mud the girl took off the soaked sheet and a sked aureliano to hold it by one side it was as heavy as a piece of canvas they squeezed it twisting it at the ends until it re gained its natural weight they turned over the mat and the swea t cam e out o f the oth er side aurelian o was anxious for that op eration never to end he knew the theoretical mechanics of love but he cou ld not sta y on his feet because of th e weakness of his knees and although he had goose pimples on hi s burning skin he could not resist the urgent need to expel the weight of his bowels when the girl finished fixing up the bed and told him to get undressed he gave her a confused explanation “they mad e me com e in they told me to throw twenty cen ts into the ho pper and hu rry up” the girl understood his confusion “if you throw in twenty cents more when you go ou t you can s tay a little lon ger” she said softly au reliano got undressed tormented by shame una ble to get ri d of the idea thathis na kedness coul d not stan d comparison with that of his brother in spite of t he girl’ s effo rts he felt m ore and mor e indifferent and terribly alone “i’ll throw in other twenty cen ts” he said with a d esolate voice the girl thanked him in silence her back was ra w her skin wa s stuck to h er ribs and her breathing was force d because of an immeasurable exhaustion two years be fore far away from th ere she had fallen asleep without putting out the candle and ha d awakened surrounded by flames the house wh ere she lived with the grandmother who had raised her was redu ced to ash es since then her grandmother carri ed her from town to town putting her to bed for twen ty cents in order to make up th e value of the burned house according to the girl’s calculations she still had ten years of seventy men per night because she also had to pay the expen ses of the trip and food for both of them as well as the pay of the indians who carried the rocking chair when the matron k nocked on the door the second time aureliano left the room without havi ng done anythi ng troubled by a desir e to weep that night h e could not sleep thinking about th e girl with a mixtur e of desire and pity he felt an irresi stible need to love her a nd protect h er at da wn worn out by insomnia an d fever he made th e calm decision to marry her in order to free her from the despotism of her grandmother and to enjoy all the nights of satisfaction that she woul d give the s eventy m en but at ten o’clock in th e morning when he reached catarino’s store the girl had left town time mitigated his mad proposal but it aggravated his feelings of frustration he took refuge in work he resigned himself to being a womanless man for all his life in order to hide the shame of his uselessness in the meantime melquíades had printed on his pl ates everythi ng that was printable in macondo a nd he left th e daguerreotype laborato ry to th e fan tasies of josé arcadio b uendía who had resolved to use it to obtain scientific proof of the existen ce of god through a complicated process of superimposed exposures taken in differe nt parts of the house he was sure that sooner or later he wou ld get a daguerreotype o f god if he existed or put an end once and for all to the supposition of his exist ence melquíades got deep er into his interpretations of nostradamus he would stay u p until very late suffocating in his faded velvet vest scribbling with his tiny sparrow hands whos e rings had lost the glow of former times one night he thought he had found a prediction of the future of macondo it was to be a luminous city with great glass houses where there was n o trace rema ining of the race of the buendía “it’s a mistake” josé arcadio buendía thundered “they won’t be houses of glass but of ice as i dreamed and there will always be a buendía per omnia secula seculorum ” úrsula fought to preserve common sense in that extravagan t house having broadened her business of little candy animals with an oven that went all night turning out baskets a nd more bas kets of bread and a prodig ious variety of puddings meringues and cookies which disap peared in a f ew hours on the roads wi nding through the swamp she had rea ched an age where she h ad a right to rest but she was noneth eless more an d more activ e so busy was she in her prosperous enterprises that one afternoon she looked distractedly to ward the courtyard while th e indian woman helped her sweeten the dough and she saw two unknown and beautiful adolescen t girls doing frame embroi dery in the light of the sunset they were rebeca and amaranta as soon as they had tak en off the mourning clothes for their grandmother which they wore with inflexible rigor for three years their bright clothes seem ed to have given them a new place in the world rebeca con trary to what might have been ex pected was the more beautiful she had a light complexion large and peaceful eyes and magical hand s that s eemed to work out the design of the embroidery with invisible threads amaranta th e younger wa s somewha t graceless but she had the natural distinction the inner tightness of her dead grandmother next to them altho ugh he was already revealing the physical drive of his father arcadio looked like a child he set abo ut learning the art of si lverwork with aureliano who had a lso taught him how to read and wr ite úrsula suddenly rea lized that th e house had become full of people that her childr en were on the point of marrying and having children and th at they would be obliged to scatter for lack of spa ce then she took out the money she had accumul ated over long years of hard labor made some arrangements with her customers and undertook the enlargement of the hous e she had a formal parlor for visits built another one that was more comfortable and cool for daily use a dinin g room with a table with twelve places where the family could sit with all of their guests nine bedrooms with windows on the courtyard and a long po rch protected from the he at of noon by a rose garden with a railing on which to place pots of ferns and begonias she ha d the kitchen enlarged to hold two ovens the granary where pilar ternera had read j osé arcadio’ s future was torn down a nd another twice as l arge built so that there would never be a la ck of food in the house s he had baths built is the courtyard in the shade of the chestnut tree one for the women and another for the men and in the rear a large stable a fencedin chicken yard a shed for the milk cows and an aviary open to the four winds so that wanderi ng birds could roost th ere at thei r pleasure followed by dozens of masons and carpenters a s if she had contracted h er husband’ s hallucinating fever úrsula fixed the position of light and heat and distributed space without the least sense of its limitations the primitive building of the founders became f illed with tools and mate rials of workmen exhaus ted by sweat who asked everybody please not to molest them exaspera ted by the sack of bones that followed the m everywhere with its dull rattle in that discomfort breathing quicklime and tar no one could see very well how fro m the bowel s of the earth there was ri sing not only the largest house is th e town but the most hos pitable and cool house that had ev er existed in the region of the swamp jos é buendía trying to su rprise divine providence in the midst of the cataclys m was the on e who least understood it the new house was almost finish ed when úrsula drew him out of his chimerical world in order to inform him that sh e had an orde r to paint the front blue and not white a s they had wanted she showed him the official document josé arcadio buendía without understanding wha t his wife was talking about deciphered the signature “who is this fellow” he asked “the magistrate” úrsula answered disconsolatel y they say he’s an authority sent by the government” don apolinar moscote the magistrate had arrive d in macondo very quietly he put up at the hotel jacob —built by one of the first arabs wh o came to s wap knickknacks for macaws—and o n the following day he rented a small room with a door on the street two blocks away from the buendía house he set u p a table and a chair that he had bought from jacob nailed up on the wal l the shield of the republic that he had brought with him and on the door he painted the sign magistrate his first order was for all the houses to be painted blue in celeb ration of the anniversary of national independence josé arcadio buendía wi th the copy of the or der in his hand found him taking his nap in a hammock he had set up in the narrow office “did y ou write this paper” he asked him don apolinar moscote a mature ma n timid with a ruddy complexion said yes “by what right” josé arcadio buendía ask ed again do n apolinar moscote picked up a paper from the drawer of the table and showed it to him “i have been na med magistrate of this town” jos é arcadio buendía did not even look at the appointment “in this town we do not give orders with pieces of paper” he said without losing his calm “and so that you know it once and for all we don’t need an y judge here becau se there’s nothing that needs judging” facing don apolinar moscote still without raisin g his voice h e gave a detailed account of how they had founded the village of h ow they had distributed the land opened the roads and introduced the improvements that n ecessity requ ired without having bothered the government and without anyone having bothered them “we are so peaceful that none of us has died even of a natural death” he said “you can s ee that we st ill don’t have any cemetery ” no once was upset that the government had no t helped them on the contra ry they were happy th at up until then it had let them grow i n peace and he hoped that it would c ontinue leaving them that way because they had not founded a town so that the first upstart who came alon g would tell them what to do do n apolinar had put on his denim jacket white like hi s trousers without losing at any moment the elegance of his gestures “so that if you want to stay here lik e any oth er ordinary citizen you’re quite welco me” josé arcadio buendía concluded “but if you’ve come to cause disor der by makin g the people paint their houses blue you can pick up your junk and go back where you came from because my house is going to be white white like a dove” don apolin ar moscote turned pale he took a step backward and tighten ed his jaws a s he said with a certain affliction “i must warn you that i’ m armed” josé arcadio buendía did not know exactly when his hands regained the useful strength with which he used to pull down horses he grabbed d on apolinar moscote by the lapels and lifted him up to the lev el of his eyes “i’m doing this” he said “because i would rather carry you ar ound alive a nd not have to keep carrying you around dead for the rest of my life” in that way he carried hi m through the middle of the street s uspended by the lap els until he put him down on his two feet on the swamp road a week later he was back with six barefoot and ragged soldiers armed with shotguns and an oxcart in which his wife and seven d aughters wer e traveling two other carts arrived later with the furniture the baggage and the household utensils he settled hi s family in the hotel jacob while he looked for a house and he went ba ck to open hi s office under the protection of the soldiers the founders of macondo resolving to expel the invaders went with their older sons to put themselv es at the disposal of josé arcadio buendía but he was against it as he explained because it was not manly to make trouble f or someone in front of his family and don apo linar had returned with his wife and daughters so he decided to resolve the situation in a pleasant wa y aureliano went with hi m about th at time h e had begun to cultivate th e black mustache with waxed tips and the somewhat stentor ian voice th at would characterize hi m in the war unarmed without payi ng any atten tion to the guards they went into the magistrate’s office don apolinar moscote did not lose his calm he introduced them to two of his daughters who happened to be there amparo sixteen dark like her mother and remedios only nine a pretty little girl with lily colored skin and green eyes they were gracious and wellmannered as so on as the m en came in before being introduced they gave them chairs to s it on but they both rema ined standin g “very well my friend” josé arcadio buendía sa id “you may stay here n ot because you have those bandits with shotguns at the door but out of consideration for your wife and daughters” don apolinar moscote was upset but josé arcadi o buendía did not give him time to reply “we only make two conditions” he went on “the first that everyone can p aint his house the color h e feels like the second that the soldiers leave at once we will guaran tee order for you” the magistrate ra ised his right hand with al l the fingers extended “your word of honor” “the word of your enemy” josé arcadio buendía said and he added in a bitter tone “because i must tell you one thing you and i are still enemies” the soldiers left that s ame afternoo n a few da ys later josé arcadio buendía found a house for the magis trate’s family everybody was at peac e except au reliano the image of remedios th e magistrate’s younger dau ghter who because of h er age could have b een h is daughter kept paining him in some part of his body it was a physical se nsation that al most bother ed him when he walked like a pebble in his shoe chapter the new h ouse white like a dove was inaugurated with a dance úrsula had got that idea from the afternoon when she saw rebeca and amaranta ch anged into adolescents and it c ould almost have been said that the main reason behind the construction was a desire to have a proper place for the girls to receive visitors in order that nothing would be la cking in splendor she worked like a galley slave a s the rep airs were under way so that before they were finished she had ordered costl y necessities for the decorations the ta ble service and the marvelous invention that was to arouse the astonishmen t of the town and the jubilation of the young people the pianola they delivered it broken down packed in several boxes that were un loaded al ong with th e viennes e furniture the bohemian crystal the tab le service from the in dies company the tablecloths from holla nd and a rich variety of lamps and candlesticks hangings an d drapes the import house sent alon g at its own expense an i talian expert pietro crespi to assemble and tune the pianola to instruct th e purchasers in its functioning and to teach them h ow to dance the lates t music printed on its six paper rolls pietro crespi was young and blond the most han dsome and well manner ed man who had ever been seen in macondo so scrupulous in his dress that in spite of the suffocating heat he would work in his brocade vest and heavy coat of dark cloth soaked in sweat keeping a reverent distance from the owners of the house he spent several weeks shut up is the parlor with a dedication much like that of aureliano in his silverwork o ne morning without opening the door without calling anyone to witness th e miracle he placed the first roll in the pianola and the tormenti ng hammering and the constant noi se of wooden lathings ceased in a sile nce that was startled at the order and neatness of the music t hey all ran to the parlor josé arcadio buendía was as if struck by lightning not becaus e of the beauty of the melody but beca use of the auto matic wor king of the keys of the pianola and he set up melquíades’ camera with the hope of getting a daguerreotype of the invisible play er that day the italian h ad lunch with them reb eca and am aranta serving the table were intimidated by the way in which the angelic man with pale and ringless hands manipulated the utensils in the living room next to the parlor pietro crespi taught them how to dance h e showed th em the s teps without touching them keeping time with a m etronome under the friendly eye of úrsula who did not leave th e room for a moment wh ile her daughters had th eir lesson pietro crespi wore special pants on those days very elastic and tight and dancing slippers “you don’t have to worry so much” josé arcadio buendía told her “the man’ s a fairy” but she did not leave off her vigilance until the ap prenticeship was over a nd the italia n left macondo then they began to organize the party úrsula drew up a s trict guest list in whic h the only ones invited were the descend ants of the founders except for th e family of pilar terner a who by then had had two more children by unknown fathers it wa s truly a hi ghclass list except that it was d etermined by feelings of friendship for those favored were not only the o ldest friends of josé arcadio buendía’s house since before they undertook th e exodus and the founding of macondo but also their sons and grandsons who were the constant companions of aureliano an d arcadi o since infa ncy and th eir daughters who were the only o nes who visited the house to embroider with r ebeca and am aranta don apolinar moscote the benevolent ruler whose activity had been reduced to the mainten ance from his scanty resources of two policemen armed with wooden clubs was a figurehead in older to support the household expenses his daughters had opened a sewing shop where they made felt flowers as well as guava delicacies an d wrote love notes to order but in spite of being modest and hardworkin g the most beautiful girls in iowa an d the most skilled at the new dances they did not manage to b e considered for the party while úrsula and th e girls unpacked fu rniture po lished silverware and hung pictures of maidens in boats full of roses which gave a br eath of ne w life to the na ked areas th at the mason s had built josé arcadio buendía stopped his pursuit of the image of god convinced of his nonexistence and he took the pianola apart in order to decipher its magical secret two days before the party swamped in a shower of leftover keys and hammers bungling in the midst of a mixup of strings that would u nroll in one direction and roll up again in the oth er he succeeded in a fashion in putting the instrument back together there h ad never been as many su rprises and as much dashi ng about as in those da ys but the new pitch la mps were lighted on the desi gnated day a nd hour the house was opened still smelling of resin and d amp whitewash and the children and grandchild ren of the founders saw the porch with ferns and begonias the quiet rooms the garden saturated with th e fragrance of the roses an d they gath ered together in the parlor facing the unknown invention that had been covered with a white sheet those who were familiar wi th the piano popular in other towns in the swamp felt a little disheartened bu t more bitter was úrsula’s disappointment when sh e put in the first roll so that amaran ta and rebeca could begin the dancing and the mechanism did not work melquíades almost blind by then crumbling with decrepitud e used the arts of his timeless wis dom in an attempt to fix it finally josé arcadio b uendía managed by mistake to move a device that was stu ck and the music cam e out fi rst in a burst and th en in a flow o f mixedup notes beatin g against the strings that had been pu t in without order or concert and had been tuned with temerity the hammers let go but the stu bborn descendants of the twentyone in trepid people who plowed through the mountains in search of th e sea to th e west avoided the reefs of the melodic mixup and the dancing went on until dawn pietro crespi came back to repair the pianola rebeca and amaranta help ed him put the strings in order and helped him with their la ughter at the mixup of the melodies it was extremely pleasan t and so chaste in its way that úrsula ceased her v igilance on the eve of his departure a farewell dance for him was impr ovised with the pianola and with rebeca he put on a skillful demonstration of modern dance arcadio and amar anta matched them in grace and skill but the exhibition was interrupted because pilar ternera wh o was at the door with the onlookers had a fight biting and hair pulling with a woman who had dared to comm ent that ar cadio had a woman’s behind toward midnight pietro crespi took his leave with a se ntimental littl e speech an d he promised to return very soon rebeca accompanied him to the door and having closed up the house and put out the lamps she went to h er room to wee p it was an inconsolable weeping tha t lasted for s everal days the caus e of which was not known even by am aranta her hermetism was not odd although she seemed expa nsive and cordial she had a solitary character an d an impenetrable heart she was a splendid adolescent with long and firm bones but she still insisted on using the small wooden rocking chair with which she had arrived at the house reinforced many times and with the arms gone no on e had discovered that even at that ag e she still had the habit of sucking her finger that was why she would not lose an opportunity to lock herself in the bathroom and had acquired the habit of sleeping with her face to the wall on rainy afternoons embroidering with a group of friends on the begonia porch she would lose the th read of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia would salt her palate when she saw the strips of damp earth and the piles of mud that th e earthworms had pushed up in the garden those s ecret tastes defeated in the past by oranges and rhubarb broke out into an irrepressible urge wh en she bega n to weep she went b ack to ea ting earth the first time she did it almost out of curios ity sure tha t the bad taste would be the best cure for the tem ptation and in fact she could not b ear the earth in her mou th but she persevered overcome by the growing anxiety and little by littl e she was getting back her ancestral a ppetite th e taste of primary minerals the unbridled satisfacti on of what was the original food she would put handfuls of earth in her pockets and ate them in small bits without bein g seen with a confused feeling of pleasure and r age as she i nstructed her gi rl friends in the most difficult needlepoint and spoke about other men who did not deserve the sa crifice of having one eat the whitewash on the walls becaus e of them the handfuls of earth ma de th e only man wh o deserved that sho w of degradation less remote and more certain as if the ground that he walked on with his fine patent leather boots in another part of the world were transmitting to her th e weight and th e temperature of his blood in a mineral savor that l eft a harsh aftertaste in h er mouth an d a sediment of peace in her heart one afternoon for no re ason amparo moscote asked permission to see the house amaranta and rebeca dis concerted b y the unexpected visit attended her with a stiff formality they showed her the remodeled mansion they had her l isten to th e rolls on the p ianola and they offered her orange marmalade and crackers amparo gave a lesson in dignity pe rsonal charm and good manners that impressed úrsula in the few momen ts that she was present d uring the visit after two hours when the conv ersation was beginning to wane amparo took advantage of amaranta’s distraction a nd gave rebeca a letter she was able to see the n ame of the estimable señorita rebeca buendía written in the same method ical hand wi th the same green ink and the same delicacy of words with which the instructions for the operation of the pianola were written and she folded the letter with the tips of her fingers and hid it in her bosom looking at a mparo moscote with an expression of endless and unconditional gratitude and a silent promise of complicity unto death the sudden friendship between amp aro moscote and rebeca buendía awakened the hopes of aureliano the memory of little remedios had not stopped tor menting him but he had not found a chance to see her when he would stroll through town with his closest friends magnífico visbal and gerineldo márquez—the sons of the founders of the same n ames—he would look for her in the sewing shop with an anxious glance but he saw only the ol der sisters the presence of ampar o moscote in the house was like a premonition “she has to come with her” aureliano would say to himself in a low voice “she has to come” he re peated i t so many tim es and with such conviction that one afternoon when he was putting together a little gold fish in the work shop he had the certainty tha t she had answered his call indeed a short time later he heard the childish voice and when he loo ked up his heart froze with terror as he saw the girl at the door dressed in pink organdy and wearing white boots “you can’t go in there remedios amparo moscote said from the hall they’re working” but aureliano did not gi ve her ti me to respond he picked u p the little fish by the chain that came throug h its mouth and said to her “come in” remedios went over and asked some questions about the fish that aureliano could not answer because he was seized with a sudde n attack of asthma he wanted to stay beside that lily skin forever beside those emerald eyes close to that voice that called him “sir” with every question showing the same respect that she gav e her father melquíades was in the corner seated at the d esk scribbling indecipherable signs aureliano hated hi m all he could do was tell remedios that he was going to give her the little fish and the girl was so s tartled by the offer that s he left the workshop as fast as she could that afternoon aureliano lost the hidden patience with which he had waited for a chance to see her he ne glected his work in severa l desperate efforts of co ncentration he willed her to appear bu t remedios did not respond he looked for her in her sisters’ shop behind the window shades in her house in her father’s office but he found her only in the image that saturated his private and terrible solitude he woul d spend who le hours with rebeca in the parlor listening to the music on the pianola she was listenin g to it because it was the music with which pietro crespi ha d taught them how to dance aureliano listened to it simply becau se everything even music reminded him of remedios the house became full of loves aureliano expresse d it in poetry that had no beginning or end he would write it on the harsh pieces of parchment tha t melquíades gave him on the bathroo m walls on the skin of h is arms and in a ll of it remedios would appear transfigured remedios in the soporific air of two in t he afternoon remedios in the soft breath of the roses remedios in the waterclock secrets of the moths remedios in the steaming morning bread remedios everywhere and remedi os forever rebeca waited for her love at four in the afternoon embroidering by the window she knew that the mailman’s mule arrived only every two weeks but she always waited for him convinced that he was goin g to arrive on some other day by mistake it happened quite the opposite once the mule did not come on the usu al day mad with desperation rebeca got up in the middle of the night and ate handfuls of earth in th e garden with a suicidal drive weeping with pai n and fury chewing tender earthworms and chipping her teeth on snail shells she vomited until dawn she fell into a state of feverish prostration lost consciousness and her hear t went into a shameless delirium úrsula scandalized forced the lock on he r trunk and found at the bottom tied together with pink ribbons the sixteen perfumed letters and th e skeletons of leaves and p etals preserved in old books and the dried butterflies that turned to p owder at th e touch aureliano was the only one capable of understa nding such desolation that afternoon while úrsula was trying to rescue rebeca from the slough of delirium he went with magnífico visbal and gerineldo márquez to catarino’s store the estab lishment had been ex panded with a gallery of wooden rooms where single women who smelled of dead flowers lived a group made up of an accordion an d drums played th e songs of francisc o the man who had not been s een i n macond o for several years the three friends drank ferm ented can e juice ma gnífico and gerineldo contemporar ies of aureliano but mor e skilled in the wa ys of the world drank methodically with the women s eated on their l aps one of the women withered and with gold work on her teeth gave aureliano a caress tha t made him shudder he rej ected h er he had discovered tha t the more h e drank the m ore he thoug ht about remedios but he could bea r the torture of his recollections better he did not know exactly when he began to float he saw his friends and the women sailing in a radiant glow without weight or mass saying wo rds that did not come o ut of their mouths an d making mysterious signals that did not correspond to their expressions catarino put a hand on his shoulder and said to hi m “it’s going on eleven” aureliano turned his head saw the enormou s disfigured face with a felt flower behi nd the ear a nd then he lost his m emory as during the tim es of forgetfulness and he recovered it on a strange da wn and in a room that was completely foreign where pilar ternera stood in her slip barefoot he r hair down holding a lamp over him startled with disbelief “aureliano” aureliano checked his feet and raised his head he did not know how he had come ther e but he knew what h is aim was because he ha d carried it hidden since infancy in an inviolable backwater of his heart “i’ve come to sleep with you” he said his clothes were smeared with mud and vomit pila r ternera who lived alone at that ti me with her two you nger children did not as k him any q uestions she took him to the bed sh e cleaned his face with a damp cloth took of his clothes and then got completely u ndressed an d lowered the mosquito netting so that her children would not see them if they woke up she had become tired of waiting for the man who would stay of the men who left of the countless men who missed the road to her house confused by the uncertainty of the cards during the wait her skin had becom e wrinkled her breasts had withered the coals of her heart had gone out she f elt for aureliano in the darkness put her hand on his stomach and kissed him on th e neck with a maternal tenderness “my poor child” she murmured aureliano shuddered with a calm skill without the slightest misstep he left his accumulated grief behind and found remedios changed into a swamp without horizons smelling of a raw animal and recently ironed clothe s when he came to the surface he was weeping first they were involuntary and broken sobs then he emptied himself out in an unleashed flow feeling that something swollen and painful had burs t inside of him she waited snatchin g his head with the tips of her fingers until his body got ri d of the dark material that would not let him live they pilar ternera asked him “who is it” and aure liano told her she let out a laugh that in other times frightened the doves and that no w did not even wake up the children “you’ll have to raise her first” she mocked but underneath the mocker y aureliano found a reservoir of u nderstanding when he went out of the room leaving behind no t only his doubts about his virility but also th e bitter weight that his heart had borne for so many months pilar ternera made him a spontaneous promise “i’m going to talk to the girl” she told him “and you’ll see wh at i’ll serve her on the tra y” she kept her promise but it was a bad moment because the h ouse had los t its pea ce of former days when she discovered rebeca’s passion whic h was impo ssible to keep secret because of her shouts ama ranta suffered an attack o f fever she al so suffered from the barb of a lonely love shut up in the bathroom she would release herself from the tor ment of a hopeless passion by writing feverish letters which sh e finally hid in the bo ttom of her tru nk úrsula barely had the strength to take care of the two sick girls she was unable after prolonged and insi dious interrogations to ascertain the causes of amaranta’s pr ostration fina lly in another moment of inspiration she force d the lock on the trunk and found the letters tied with a pink ribb on swollen with fresh lilies and still wet with tears addressed and never sent to pietro crespi weeping with rage she cursed the day tha t it had occurred to her to buy the pianola and she forbade the embroidery lessons and decreed a kind of mourning with no one dead which was to be prolon ged until the daughters got over their hopes useless was the intervention of josé arcadi o buendía who had modified his first impression of pietro cre spi and admired his ability in the mani pulation of musical machines so that when pilar ternera told aureliano that remedi os had decided on marriage he could s ee th at the n ews would only give his parents more trouble invited to the parlor for a formal interview josé arcadi o buendía and úrsula liste ned stonily to their son’s declaration when he learned the name of the fiancée however josé arcadio b uendía grew red with i ndignation “love is a disease” he thundered “with so many pretty and decent girls around the only thing that occurs to you is to get married to the daughter of our enemy” but úr sula agreed with the choice she confessed her affection for the seven moscote sisters for their beauty thei r ability for work their modesty and their good manners and she celebrated her son’s prudence conquered by his wife’s enthusiasm josé arcadio buendía then laid down one condition rebeca who was the one he wanted would marry pietro crespi úrsula would take amaranta on a trip to the capital of the province when she had time so that con tact with different people wo uld alleviate her disappointment rebeca got her health back just as soon as she heard of the agreem ent and she wrote her fiancé a jubilant letter tha t she submitted to her parents’ approval and put into the mail without the use of any intermediaries amaranta pretended to accept the decision and little by little s he recovered from her fevers but she promised herself that rebeca would marry only over her dead body the following saturday josé arcadio buendía put on his dark suit his celluloid collar and th e deerskin boots that he had worn for the first time the night of the party and went to ask for the hand of remedios moscote the m agistrate and his wife received him pleased and worried at the same tim e for they did n ot know the reason for th e unexpected visit and then they th ought that he was confused about the name of the intended bride in order to remove the mistake the mother woke remedios up and carried her into the living room still drowsy fr om sleep they asked her if it was true th at she had decided to get married an d she answered whimpering that she only wanted them to let her sleep josé arcadio buendía unde rstanding the distress of the moscotes went to clear things up with aureliano when he returned the moscotes had put on formal clothing had rearranged the furniture and put fresh flowers in th e vases an d were waiti ng in the co mpany of th eir older daughters overwhelmed by th e unpleasa ntness of the occasion and the bothersome hard collar josé arcadio buendía confirmed the fact that remedios indeed was the ch osen one “it doesn’t make sense” don apolinar moscote said wi th consternation “we have six other daughters all unmarried and at an age where they deserve it who would be delighted to be the ho norable wife of a gentlem an as serious and hardworking as yo ur son and aurelito lays his eyes precisely on the one who still wets her bed” his wife a wellpreser ved woman with afflicted eyelids and expression scolded his mistake when they finished the fr uit punch they willingly accepted aureliano’s decision except that señora moscote begged the fa vor o f speaking to úrsula alone intrigued protesting that they were involving her in men’s affa irs but really feeling deep emotion úrsula went to visit her the next day a half hour later she returned with the news that rem edios had not reached puberty aureliano did not consider that a serious barrier he had waited so l ong that he could wait as long as was necessary un til his bride reached the a ge of conception the newfound harmony was interrupted by th e death of melquíades although it was a foreseeable event the circumstances were not a fe w months after his return a process of aging had taken place i n him that was so rapid and critical that soon he was treated as one of those useless greatgrandfathers who wander abou t the bedroo ms like shad es dragging their feet remembering better times aloud and whom no one bothers abou t or rememb ers really until the morning they find them d ead in their bed at first josé arcadio bue ndía helped him in his work enthusiastic over th e novelty of the daguerreotypes and the predictions of nostradamus but little by little he began abandoning him to his s olitude for communicati on was b ecoming increasingly difficult he wa s losing his sight and his hearing he seemed to conf use the people he was speaking to with others he had known in remote epochs of mankind and he would answer questions with a complex hodgepodge of languages he would walk along gr oping in the air al though he pass ed between objects with an inexplicable fluidity as if be wer e endowed with some instinct of direction based on an immedia te prescience one day he forgot to put in his false teeth whi ch at night h e left in a glass of water beside his bed and he never put them in again when úr sula undertook the enla rgement of the house she had them build him a special room next to aur eliano’s workshop far from the noise and bustle of the house with a window flooded wi th light and a bookcase where she herself put in order the books that were almost destroyed by dust and moths the flaky stacks of paper covered with indecip herable signs and th e glass with his false teeth where som e aquatic pla nts with tiny yellow flowers had taken root the n ew place seemed to pl ease melquíades because h e was n ever seen any more not even in the dining room he only went to aureliano’s workshop where he would spend hours on end scribbling his enigmatic literature on the parchm ents that h e had brought with him and that seemed to have been made out of some dry material that crumpled like puff paste there he ate the meals that visitación brought him twi ce a da y although in the last days he lost his appetite and fed only on vegetables he soon acquired th e forlorn look tha t one sees in vegetarians his skin bec ame covered with a thin moss similar to that which flourished on the antique vest tha t he never too k off and his breath exh aled the odo r of a sleeping animal aureliano ended up forget ting about him absorbed in the composition of his poems but on one occasion he thought he understood something of what melquíades was sa ying in his groping m onologues a nd he paid attention in reality the only thing that could be isolated in the rocky paragraphs was the insistent hammering on the wor d equinox equinox equino x and the name of al exander von humboldt arcadio got a little closer to him when he b egan to help aureliano in his silverwork melquíades answered tha t effort at co mmunicatio n at times b y giving forth with phrases in spanish that had very little to do with reality one afternoon however he seemed to be illuminate d by a sudden emotion years later facing the firing squad arcadio woul d remember the trembling with which melquíades made him listen to several pages of his impenetrabl e writing which of course he did not u nderstand but which when read alo ud were like encyclicals b eing chanted then he sm iled for the first time in a long while and said in spanish “when i die burn mercury in my room for three d ays” arcadio told that to josé arcadio buendía and the latter tried to get more explicit information but he received only one answer “i have found immortality” when melquíades’ breathing began to smell arcadio took him to bathe in the river on thursday mornings he seemed to get b etter he wo uld undress and get into the water with the boys and his my sterious sense of orientation would allow him to avoid the deep and dang erous spots “we come fr om the wa ter” he said on a certai n occasion much time passed in that way without anyone’s seeing him in the house except on the night when he made a pathetic effort to fix the pianola an d when he would go to the river with arcadio carrying under his arm a gourd and a bar of palm o il soap wrapped in a towel one thursday before they called h im to go to the river aureliano heard him say “i have died of fever on the dunes of singapore” that da y he went into the wa ter at a bad spot and they did not find hi m until the following day a few miles downstrea m washed u p on a bright bend in the river and with a solitary vulture sitting on his stomach ov er the scand alized protests of úrsula who wept with more grief than she had had for her own father j osé arcadi o buendía was opposed to their burying him “he is immortal” he said “an d he himself revealed the formula of his resurrection” he brought out the forgotten water pipe and put a kettle of mercury to boil next to the body which little by little was filling with blue bubbles don apolinar moscote ventured to remind him that an unburied drowned man was a danger to public health “none of t hat because he’s alive” was the an swer of josé arcadio buendía who finished the s eventytwo hou rs with the mercurial incense as the body was already beginning to burst with a livid fluorescen ce the soft whistles of which impregnated the house with a pestilential vapor only then did he permit them to bury him not in any o rdinary way but with the honors reserved for mac ondo’s greatest be nefactor it was the first burial and the best attended one that was ever seen in th e town only surpassed a century later by big mama’s funeral carnival they buried him in a grave d ug in the center of the p lot destined for the cem etery with a stone on wh ich they wro te the only thing they knew about hi m melquí ades they gave him his nine nights of wake in the tumult that gathered in the courtyar d to drink coffee tell jokes and play cards amaranta found a chance to confess her lo ve to pietro crespi who a few weeks before ha d formalized his promise to rebeca and had set up a store for musical instruments and mechanical toys in the s ame section where the arabs had lin gered in other times swapping knickknacks for macaws and which the p eople called the street of the turks the italian whose head covered with patent leather curls aroused in women an irrepressibl e need to sigh dealt with amara nta as with a capricious little girl who was not worth taking seriously “i have a younger brother” he told her “he’s coming to help me in the store” amaranta felt humiliated and told pietro crespi wi th a virulent anger that she was prepared to stop her sister’s wedding even if her own dead bo dy had to li e across the door the italian was so impressed b y the dramatics of the th reat tha t he could not resist the tem ptation to mention it to rebeca tha t was ho w amaranta’s tri p always put off by úrsula’s work wa s arranged in less than a week am aranta put up no resistance but when she kissed rebeca goodbye she whisp ered in her ear “don’t get your hopes up even if they send me to the ends of the earth i’ll find some way of stopping you from getting married even if i have to kill you” with the absence of úrsula with the invisible pr esence of melquíades who continued his stealth y shuffling through the rooms the house seemed enormous and empty rebeca took charge of domestic order while the indian woma n took care of the bakery at dusk when pietro c respi would arrive preceded by a co ol breath of lavender and always bringing a toy as a gift his fiancée woul d receive the visitor in the main parlor with doors and windows open to be safe from any suspicion it was an unnecessary preca ution for the italian had s hown himself to be so respectful tha t he did no t even touch the hand of the woman who was going to be his wife within th e year thos e visits were filling the house with remarkable toys mechanic al ballerinas music boxes acrobatic monkeys trotting horses clowns who played the tambour ine the rich and startling mechanica l fauna that pietro crespi brought dissipated josé arcadio buendía ’s affliction over the death of mel quíades and carried him back to his o ld days as an alchemist he lived at that tim e in a paradise of disemboweled animals of mechanisms that had been taken apar t in an attempt to perfect them wi th a system of perpetual motion based upon the principles of the pendulum aureliano for his part had neglected the worksho p in order to teach little remedios to read and write at first the child p referred her dolls to the man who would come every afternoon and who was responsible for her bei ng separated from her toys in order to be bathed a nd dressed an d seated in the parlor to receive the visitor but aureliano’s patience and devotion finally won her over up to the point where she would spend many hours with him studying the meaning of the letters and sketching in a notebook with colored pencils little houses with cows in the corral and rou nd suns with yellow rays that hid behind the hills only rebeca was unhap py because of amaranta ’s threat she knew her sister’s character th e haughtiness of her sp irit and she was frightened by the virulence of her anger she would spend whole hours sucking her finger in the bathroom ho lding herself back with an exhausting iron will so as not to eat earth in search of some relief for her uncertainty she called pilar ternera to read her future after a string of conventiona l vagaries pilar ternera predicted “you will not be happy as long as your parents remain unburied” rebeca shud dered as in the memor y of a drea m she s aw herself entering the hous e as a ver y small girl with the trunk and the little rocker an d a bag whose contents she had never known she remembered a bald gentleman dressed in linen an d with his collar closed by a gold butt on who had nothing to do with the k ing of hearts she re mem bered a very young and beautiful woman with warm and perfumed hands who had nothing in common with the ja ck of diamonds and his rheumatic hands and who used to pu t flowers in he r hair and take her out walking in the afternoon through a town with green streets “i don’t understand” she said pilar ternera seemed disconcerted “i don’t either but that’s what th e cards say” rebeca was so preoccupi ed with the enigma that she told it to josé arcadio buendía and he scolded her for believing in the predictions of th e cards but he undertook the silent task of searching closets and tr unks moving furniture and turning over beds an d floorboards looking for the bag of bones he r emembered that he had not seen i t since the ti me of the r ebuilding he secretly sum moned the masons and one of them revealed that he had wal led up the bag in some bedroom because it bothered him in his work after se veral d ays of listening with their ears against the walls th ey perceived the d eep cloccloc they penetrated the wall and ther e were the b ones in th e intact bag t hey buried it the sam e day in a grave without a s tone next to that of melq uíades and josé arcadi o buendía r eturned ho me free of a burden that for a moment had weighed on his conscience a s much as the memory of prudenci o aguilar when he went through the kitchen he kissed rebeca on the forehead “get those bad thoughts out of your head” he told her “you’re going to be happy” the friendship with rebeca opened up to pilar ternera the do ors of the house closed by úrsula since the birth of arcadio she would arrive at an y hour of the day like a flock of goats and would unleash her feverish energy in the ha rdest task s sometimes she would go into the workshop and help arcadio sensitize th e daguerreotype plates with an efficiency and a tenderness that ended up b y confusing him that woman bothered him the tan of her skin her smell of smoke the disorder of her laughter in the darkroom distracted his attentio n and made him bump into things on a certain occasion aureliano was there worki ng on his silver and pilar ternera lea ned over the table to admire his la borious patience suddenl y it happened aureliano made sure that arcadio was in the d arkroom before raising his eyes and m eeting those of pilar tern era whose thought was perfectly visible as if exposed to the li ght of noon “well” aure liano said “tell me what it is” pilar ternera bit her lips with a sad smile “that you’d be good in a war” she said “ where you put your eye you put your bullet” aureliano relaxed with the proof of the omen he went back to concentr ate on his work as if nothing had happened and his voice took on a restful strength “i will recognize him” he said “he’ll bear my name” josé arcadio buendía finally got what he was l ooking for he connected the mechanis m of the clock to a m echanical bal lerina and the toy danced uninterrupted ly to the rhythm of her own music for three days that d iscovery excited him m uch more than any of his other harebrained undertakings he stopped eating he stopped sleeping only the vigilance and care of rebeca kept him from being dragged off by his i magination in to a s tate of perpetual delirium from which he would not recover he would spend the nights wa lking around the room thinking aloud searching for a way to apply th e principles of the pendulu m to oxcarts to harrows to everything that wa s useful when put into motion the fever of insomnia fatigued him so much that one dawn he could not recognize the old man with white hair and un certain gestures who came into his bedroom it was prudencio aguilar when he finally identified him startled that the dead also aged josé arcadio buendía felt himself shaken by nos talgia “prudencio ” he exclaimed “you’ve come from a long wa y off” after many years of death the yearning for the living was so intense the need for company so pressing so terrifying the neatn ess of that oth er death whi ch exists withi n death th at prudencio aguilar had ended up lov ing his worst enemy h e had spent a great deal of time looking for him he asked the dead from riohacha abou t him the de ad who ca me from the upar valley those who came from the swamp and no one could tell him because macondo was a town that was unknown to the d ead until melquíades arrived and marked it with a sm all black dot on the m otley maps of death josé arcadio buendía conversed with prud encio aguilar until dawn a few hours later worn out by the vigil he went into aurelian o’s workshop and asked him “what day is today ” aureliano told him tha t it was tuesday “i was thinking th e same thing” josé arc adio buendía said “but suddenly i realized that it’ s still monday like yester day look at the sky look at the walls look at the begonias today is monday too” used to his manias aureliano paid no attention to hi m on the next day wednesday josé arcadio bu endía went back to the workshop “this is a disaster” he said “look at the air listen to the buzzing of the sun the same as yesterday and the day b efore today is monday too” that night pietro crespi found hi m on the porch weeping for prudencio aguilar for melquíades for rebeca’s parents for his mother an d father for all of those he could remember and who were now alone in death he gave him a mechanical bear that walked on its hind legs on a tightrope but he could not distract him from hi s obsession he asked him what had happened to the project h e had explai ned to him a few days b efore about the possibility of building a pendu lum machine tha t would help men to fly and he answered that it was impossible because a pendulum could lift anything into the air but it could not lift itself on thursday he appeared in the workshop again with the painful look of plowed ground “t he time machine has br oken” he almost sobbed “and úrsula and amaranta so far away” aureliano scolded him like a child and he adopted a contrite air he spent six hours examining things trying to find a difference from their appearance on the previous day in t he hope of discovering in th em some change that would reveal the passage of time he spent the whole night in bed wit h his eyes o pen calling to prudencio aguilar to melquíades to all the d ead so that they would share his distress but no one came on friday before anyo ne arose he watched the appear ance of nature again until he did not have the slightest doubt but that it was monday then he grabbed the bar from a door and with the sava ge violence of his uncom mon strength he smash ed to dust the equip ment in th e alchem y laboratory the daguerreotype room the silver workshop shouting like a man possessed in some highsounding and fluent but completely in comprehensi ble language he was abo ut to finish off the rest of the house when aureli ano asked th e neighbors for help te n men were needed to get him down fourteen to tie him up twenty to drag him to the chestnu t tree in th e courtyard wher e they left him tied up barking in the strange l anguage and giving of f a green froth at the mouth when úrsula and amaranta returned he was still tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree by his hands and feet soaked with rain an d in a sta te of total inn ocence th ey spoke to him and he looked at th em withou t recognizing them saying things they did not understand úrsula untied his wrists and ankles lacer ated by the pressure of the rope and left him tied only by the waist later on they built him a shelter of palm brandies to protect him from the sun and the rain chapter aurelia no buendía and remedios moscote were married one sunday in march before the altar father nicanor reyna had set up in the parlor it was the culmination of four weeks of shocks in th e moscote household beca use little remedios had reache d puberty before getting over the habits of childhood in spite of the fact that her mother had taught her about the changes of adolescence on e february afternoon she burst shouting into the l iving room where her si sters were chatting with aureliano and showed them her panties smeared with a chocolatecolored paste a mo nth for th e wedding was agreed upon there was barely enough time to teach her how to wash herself get dressed by h erself and understand th e fundamental business o f a home th ey mad e her urinate over hot bricks in order to cure her of the habit of wetting her bed it took a good deal of work to convince her of the inviolability of the marital secret for remedios was so confused and at the sam e time so ama zed at the revelation tha t she wanted to talk to everybody about the details of the wedding night it was a fatiguing effort but on th e date set for the ceremo ny the child was as adep t in the ways of the world as any of her sisters don apolinar moscote escorted her by th e arm down the street th at was deco rated with flowers and wr eaths ami dst the explosion of rockets and the music of several bands and she waved with her h and and gave her thanks with a smile to those who wished her good luck from the windows aure liano dressed in black wearing the same paten t leather boots with metal fasteners that he would have on a f ew years later as he faced the firing squad had an intense paleness and a hard lump in his throat when he met the bride at the door o f the house and led her to the altar she behaved as naturally with such discretion that she did not lose her composure not even when aureliano dropped the ring as he tried to put it on her finger in the midst of the murmurs and confusion of the gu ests she kept her arm with the fingerless lace glove held up and remained like that with her ri ng finger ready until the bridegroom managed to stop the ring with his foot before it rolled to th e door and came b ack blushing to the altar h er mother and sisters suffered so much from the fear that the chi ld would do something wrong during the ceremon y that in the end they wer e the ones w ho committed the impertinence of picking her up to kiss her from that d ay on the s ense of respo nsibility the natural grace the calm control that remedios would have in the face of adverse ci rcumstances was revealed it was she who on h er own initiativ e put aside the largest pi ece that sh e had cut fro m the weddi ng cake and took it on a plate with a fork to josé arcadio buendía tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree h uddled on a wooden stoo l underneath the palm shelter the enormous old man discolored by the sun and rain made a vague smile of gratitude and at the piece of cake with his fingers mumbling an unintelligible psalm the only unhappy person in that noisy cel ebration wh ich lasted until dawn on monday wa s rebeca buen día it was her own frustrated party b y an arrangement of úrsula’s her marriage was to be celebrated on the sa me day but that friday pi etro crespi received a letter with th e news of his mother’s imminent death the wed ding was postponed pietro crespi left for the capital of the province an hour after receiving the letter and on the road he missed his mother who arrived punctually saturday night and at aurel iano’s wedding sang the sad aria that s he had prepa red for the wedding of her son pietro crespi returned on sund ay midnight to sweep up the ashes of the party after having worn out five horses on the road in an attemp t to be in time for his wedding it was never discovered who wr ote the letter tormented by úrsula amaranta wept with indi gnation and swore her innocence in front of the altar which the carpenters h ad not finished dismantling father nicanor reyna—whom don apolinar moscote had brought from the swamp to officiate at the wedding—was an old man h ardened by the ingr atitude of his ministry his skin was sad wit h the bones al most exposed and he had a pronounced round stomach and the expression of an old angel which came more from simplicity than fr om goodness he had planned to return to his pariah after the wedding but he was a ppalled at the hardness of the inhabitants of macondo who were prospering in the midst of sc andal subject to th e natural law witho ut baptizing their children or sanctifying their festivals thinking that no land needed the seed of god so much he decided to stay on for another week to christianize both circu mcised and gentile legalize concubinage and give the sacramen ts to the dying but no one paid an y attention to him they would answer him that th ey had been many years without a prie st arranging the business of thei r souls directly with god and that th ey ha d lost the evi l of original sin tired of preaching in the open fa ther nicanor decided to undertake th e building of a church the largest in th e world with lifesize saints and s tainedglass windows on the sides s o that peopl e would co me from r ome to hon or god in the cen ter of impiety he went everywhere begging alms with a copper dish they gave him a large amount but he wanted more because the church had to have a bell that would raise the drowned up to the surface of the water he pleaded so much that he lo st his voice his bones began to fill with sounds one saturda y not even having collected the price of the doors he fell into a desperate confusion he improvised an altar in the square and on sunday he went through the town with a small bell as in the days of insomnia calling people to an openai r mass many went out of curiosity others from nostalgia others so that god would not take th e disdain for his intermediary as a personal insult so that at ei ght in the morning half the town was in the square where father nicanor chanted the gospels in a voice that ha d been lacerated by his pleading at the end when the congregation began to break up he raised his arms signaling for attention “just a moment” he said “now we shall witness an undeniabl e proof of the infinite power of god” the boy who had helped him with the mass brough t him a cu p of thick and steaming chocolate which he dra nk without p ausing to breathe then he wiped his li ps with a handkerchief that he drew from his slee ve extended his arms and closed his eyes thereu pon father nicanor rose six inches above the level of the ground it was a convincin g measure he went am ong the hou ses for several days repea ting the demon stration of levitation by means of ch ocolate while the a colyte collected so much money in a bag th at in less tha n a month h e began the construction of the church no on e doubted the divine origin of the demo nstration ex cept josé arcadio buendía who without changing expression watched the troop of people who gather ed arou nd the ches tnut tree one morning to witness the revelation once more he merely st retched on his stool a little and shrugged his shoulders when father nicanor beg an to rise up fr om the ground along wi th the chair he was sittin g on “hoc est simplicissimus ” josé arcadio bu endía said “ homo iste statum quartum materiae i nvenit” father nica nor raised his hands and the four legs of the chai r all landed on the ground at the same time “ nego” he said “ factum hoc existentiam dei probat sine dubio ” thus it was discovered that josé arcadio buend ía’s devilish jargon was latin father nicanor took advantage of the circumstance of his being the only person who had been able to communicate with him to try to inject the faith into his twisted mind every afternoon he would sit by the chestnut tree preaching in latin but josé arcadi o buendía insisted on rejecting rhetorical tricks and the transmutation of chocolate and he demand ed the daguerreotype of god as the only proof father nica nor then bro ught him medals and pictur es and even a reproduction of the veronica but josé arcadi o buendía rejected them as artistic objects without any sci entific basis he was so stubborn that father nicanor gave up his attempts at evangelization and continued visiting him out of humanitarian feelings but then it was josé ar cadio buendía who took the lead and tried to break down the priest’s faith with rationalist tricks on a certain occa sion when father nicano r brought a checker set to the chestn ut tree and invited him to a game josé arcadio buendía would not accept because according to him he could never understand the sense of a contest in which the two adversaries have agreed upon the rules father nicanor who had never seen checkers played that way could n ot play it again ever more startled at j osé arcadio bue ndía’s lucidity he ask ed him how it was possible that th ey had him tied to a tree “hoc est simplicissimus ” he replied “because i’m crazy” from then on concerned about his own faith t he priest did not come back to visit him and dedicated hi mself to hurrying along t he building of the church rebeca fel t her hopes being reborn her future was predicated on the com pletion of th e work for one sunday when father nicanor was lunching at the house and the whol e family sitting at th e table spok e of the solemnity a nd splendor that religious ceremonies would acquire when the ch urch was built amaranta said “the luckiest one will be rebeca” and since rebeca did not unde rstand what she meant she explained it to her with an inno cent smile “you’re goin g to be the one who will inaugurate the church with your wedding” rebeca tried to forestall any commen ts the wa y the construction was going the church would not be built before another ten years father nica nor did not agree the growing generosity of the faithful permitted him to make mor e optimistic calculations to the mute indignation of rebeca who could not finish her lunch úrsula celebrated amaranta’s idea and con tributed a co nsiderable sum for the work to move faster father nicanor felt that with another contribution like that the church woul d be ready within three years from then on rebeca did not say ano ther word to amaranta convinced tha t her initiative had not th e innocence that she attempted to give it “that was th e leas t serious thin g i could ha ve done” amaranta ans wered her d uring the violent argumen t they had that night “in that way i won’t have to kill you fo r three years” rebeca accepted the challenge when pietro crespi found out about the new postponement he went through a crisis of disappointment but rebeca gave him a final proof of her loyalty “we’ll elope whenever you say” she told him pietro crespi however was not a ma n of adventure he lacked the impulsive character of his fiancée and he considered respect for on e’s given word as a wealth that sh ould not be squandered then rebeca turned to more audaci ous methods a mysterious wind blew out the lamps in the parlor and úrsula surprised the lovers kissing in t he dark pietro crespi ga ve her some confused explanations about the poor quality of modern pitch lamps and he even helped her install a more secure system of illumination for the room but the fuel failed again or the wicks became clogged and úrsula found rebeca sitting on her fiancé’s lap this time she would accept no explanation she turned the responsibility of the bakery over to the indian woman and sat in a rocking chair to watch over the young people during the visits ready to win out over maneuvers that had already been old wh en she was a girl “poor ma ma” rebeca would sa y with mock indignation seeing úrsula yawn during the boredom of the visits “when she dies she’ll go off to her reward in that rocking chair” after three mon ths of supervi sed love fatigued by the slow progress of the construction which he went to inspect every day pi etro crespi decided to give father nicanor the money he needed to finish the church amaranta di d not grow impatient as she conversed with her girl friends every afternoon when they came to em broider on the porch s he tried to think of new subterfuges a mistake in calculation spoiled the one she con sidered the most effecti ve removing the mothball s that rebeca had put in her wedding dress before she put it away in the bedroom dresser she did it when two months were left for the completi on of the ch urch but rebeca was so impatient wi th the approach of the wedding that she wanted to get the dress ready earlier than amaranta had foreseen when she o pened the dr esser and un folded first the papers and then the protective cl oth she found the fabric of the dress and the stitches of the veil and even the crown of orange blossoms perforated by moths although she was sure that she had put a handful of mothballs in the wrappin gs the disaster seemed so natural th at she did not dare bla me amaran ta there was less than a mo nth until the wedding but amparo m oscote prom ised to sew a new dress within a week amaranta felt faint that rainy noontime when amparo came to the house wrapped in the froth of needlework for rebeca to have the fi nal fitting of the dress she lost her voice and a thread of cold sweat ran down the pa th of her spin e for long months she had trembled with fright waiting for that hour be cause if she had not been able to conceive the ultimate obsta cle to rebeca’s wedding she was sure th at at the last moment wh en all the resources of her imagination had failed she would have the courage to poison her that afternoon while rebeca was suffocating with heat inside the armor of thread that ampa ro moscote was putting about her body with thousands of pins and infinite patience amaranta m ade several mistakes in her crocheting and pricked her finger wit h the needle b ut she decided with frightful coldness that the date would be the last friday before the wedding and the meth od would be a d ose of laudanum in her coffee a greater obstacle as impassable as it wa s unforeseen obliged a new and indefinite postponement one week before the date set for the wedding little remedi os woke up i n the middle of the night soaked in a hot broth which had ex ploded in her insides with a kind of tearing belch and she died three days later poisoned by her own blood with a pair of twins crossed in her stomach amarante suffered a crisis of conscience she had begged god with such fervor for something fearful to happen so that she would not have to poison rebeca that she felt guilty of remedios’ death that was not the obstacle th at she had begged for so much remedios had brought a breath of m erriment to th e house she h ad settl ed do wn with her husband in a room near the worksho p which she decorated with the dolls and toys of her recent childhood and her merry vitality overflowed th e four walls of th e bedroom and went like a whirlwind of good health along the porch with the begonias she would start singin g at da wn s he was the only person who dared intervene in the argumen ts between rebeca and am aranta she plunged i nto the fatiguing chore o f taking care of josé arca dio buendía she would bring him his food she would help him with his daily necessities wash him with soap and a scrubb ing brush ke ep his hair and beard free of lice and nits keep the palm shelter in good condition an d reinforce it with waterproof canvas in stormy weather in her last months she had succeed ed in communicating with him in phrases of rudimentary latin when the son of aureliano and pilar ternera was born an d brought to the house and baptized in an intimate cerem ony with th e name aur eliano josé remedios decided that he would be considered their oldest child her maternal instinct surprised úrsula aureliano for his part found in her the jus tification that he needed to live he worked all day in his workshop and remedios would bring him a cup of black coffee in the middle of the morning they would both visit the moscotes every night aureliano would pl ay endless games of dominoes with his fatherin law while remedios chatted with her sisters or ta lked to her mother abou t more important things the link with the bu endías consolidated don apolinar moscote’s authority in th e town on frequent trips to th e cap ital of the p rovince he succeeded in getting the government to build a school so that arcadio who had inherited the ed ucational enthusiasm of his grandfather could take charge of it through persuasion he managed to g et the majority of houses painted blue in time for the date of n ational indep endence at the urging of father nica nor he arranged for the transfer of catarino’s store to a ba ck street an d he closed down several scandalous establishments tha t prospered in the cen ter of town once he returned with six policemen arm ed with rifles to whom he entrusted th e maintenan ce of order and no on e remembered the original agreement not to have armed men in the town aureliano enjoyed his fatheri nlaw’s efficiency “you’re going to get as fat as he is” his friends would say to him but his sedentary life which accentuated his cheekbones and concentra ted the sparkle of his eyes did not in crease his weight or alter the parsimony of his character bu t on the co ntrary it hardened on his lips the straight line of solitary meditation and implacable d ecision so deep was the affection tha t he and his wife had su cceeded in a rousing in both their families that when remedi os announced th at she was going to h ave a child even rebeca and amaran ta decl ared a truce in ord er to knit items in blue wool if it was to be a boy and in pink wool in case it was a girl she was the last pers on arcadio tho ught about a few years la ter when he faced the firing squad úrsula ordered a mourning period of closed door s and windows with no one entering or leaving except on matters of u tmost n ecessity she pr ohibi ted any talking aloud for a year and she pu t remedios’ d aguerreotype in the place where her body had been laid out wi th a black ribbon around it and an oil lamp that was always kept lighted future genera tions who n ever let th e lamp go out would be puzzled at that girl in a ple ated skirt white boots and with an organdy band around her head and th ey were nev er able to connect h er with the sta ndard image of a greatgrandmother amaranta took charge of aureliano j osé she ad opted him as a son who would share her solitude and relieve her from the involutary laudanum th at her mad beseeching had thrown into remedios’ coffee pietro crespi would tiptoe in at dusk with a black ribbon on his hat and he would pay a silent visit to rebeca wh o seemed to be bleeding to death insid e the black d ress with sleeves down to her wrists just the idea of thinking abou t a new date for the wedding would have been so irreverent that the engagement turned into an eternal relationship a fatigued love that no o ne worried about again as if the lovers who in other days had sa botaged the l amps in order to kiss had been abandoned to the free will of de ath having lost her bearings completely demoralized rebeca began eating earth again suddenly—when the mourning had gone on so l ong that the needlepoint sessions began again— someone pu shed open the street do or at two in the afternoo n in the mortal silence of the heat an d the braces in the foundation shook with such for ce that amaranta and her friends sewing on the porch rebeca sucking her finger in her bedroom úrsula in the kitchen aureliano in the workshop and even josé arcadio buendía under the solitary chestn ut tree had the impression that a n earthquake was breaking up the house a huge ma n had arrived his square shoulders barely fitted through the doorways he was wearing a medal of our lady of help around his bison neck his arms and chest were co mpletely cov ered with crypti c tatto oing and on his right wrist was the tight copper bracelet of the niñosenc ruz amulet his skin was tanned by the salt of the open air his hair was short an d straight like the mane of a mule his jaws were of ir on and he wore a sad smile he had a belt on that was twice as thick as the cinch of a horse boots with leggings and spurs and iron on the heels and his presence gave the quaking im pression of a seismic t remor he w ent through the parlor an d the living room carrying some halfw orn saddlebags in his hand and he appeared like a thundercla p on the porch with the begonias wher e amaranta and her friends were paralyzed their needles in th e air “hello” he said to them in a tired voice threw the sa ddlebags on a wo rktable and went by on his way to th e back of the house “hello ” he said to the startled rebecca who saw hi m pass by the door of her bedroom “hello” he sa id to aureliano who was at his silversmith’s bench with all five senses alert he did not linger with anyone he went directly to the kitchen and there h e stopped for the first time at the end of a trip that had begun of the other side of the world “hello” he said úrsula stood for a fraction of a second with her mouth open looked into his e yes gave a cry and flung her arms around his neck shouting and weeping with joy it was josé arcadio he wa s returning as poor as when he had left to such an extreme that úrsula had to give him two pesos to pay for the rental of his horse he spoke a spanish that was larded with sailor slang they asked where he ha d been and h e answered “out there” he hung his hammock i n the room they assigned him and slept for three days when he woke up af ter eating sixteen raw eggs he went directly to catarino’s store where his monumental size prov oked a panic of curiosity among the women he called for m usic and cane liquor fo r everyone to be put on his bill he would indianwrestle with five men at the same time “it can’t be done” they said convinced that th ey would not be able to move his arm “he has niñose ncruz” catarino who did not believe in magical tricks of strength bet him twelve p esos that he could not move the coun ter josé arcadio pulle d it out of its pl ace lifted it over his head and put it in the street it took elev en men to put it back in the heat of the party h e exhibited his unusual ma sculinity on the bar compl etely covered with tattoos of word s in several languages intertwined in blue and red to the wo men who were besieging him and cov eting him he put the question as to who would pay the most the one who had the most money o ffered him twenty pesos then he proposed raffling himself off among them at ten pesos a chance it was a fantastic price becaus e the most so ughtafter woman earned eight pesos a night but they all accepted th ey wrote th eir names on fourteen pieces of pap er which they put into a hat and each woman took one out wh en there wer e only two pi eces left to d raw it was es tablished to whom they belonged “five pesos more from each one” josé arcadi o proposed “and i’ll share myself with both he made his living that way he had been around the world sixtyfive times enlisted in a crew of sailors without a coun try the wom en who went to bed with him that night in catarino’s store brought him naked into the dance sal on so that peopl e could see that ther e was not a s quare inch of his body that was not tattooed front and back and from his neck to his toes he did not succeed i n becoming incorporated into the family he slept a ll day and spent the night in the redlight district making bets on his strength on th e rare occa sions when úrsula got him to sit down a t the table h e gave signs of radiant good humor especially when he told ab out his adventures in remote coun tries he had been shipwrecked and spent two weeks a drift in the sea of japan feeding on the body of a comrade wh o had succu mbed to sunstroke and whose extrem ely salty flesh as it cooked in the sun had a sweet and granular taste under a bright noo nday sun in the gulf of bengal his ship had killed a sea dragon in the stomach of which they foun d the helmet the buckles and the weapons of a crusader in the caribbean he had seen the ghost of the pirate ship of victor hugues with its sails torn by the winds of death the masts chewed by sea worms and still looking for the course to guadeloupe úrsula would weep at th e table as if she were read ing the letters that had never arrived and in which josé arca dio told abo ut his deeds an d misadventures “and there was s o much of a home here for you my son” sh e would sob “and so mu ch food thr own to the hogs” but underneath i t an she coul d not con ceive that the b oy the gypsies took away was th e sam e lout wh o would eat half a suckling pig for lunch and whose fl atulence withered the flowers something similar took place with the rest of the family amaranta could not conceal the repugnance th at she felt at the table because of his bestial belchi ng arcadio who never knew the secret of their relationship scarcely ans wered the q uestions tha t he asked wi th the ob vious idea of gaining his affection aureliano tried to relive the times wh en they slept in the sa me room tried to revive the complicity of childhood but josé arcadio had forgotten about it because life at sea had saturated h is memory with too ma ny things to remember only rebeca succumbed to the first impact the day tha t she saw him pass by her bedroom she thought that pi etro crespi was a sugary dandy next to tha t protomale whose volcanic breathing could be hear d all over the house she tried to get near hi m under any pr etext on a certain occas ion josé arca dio looked at her body with shameless atten tion and said to her “you’re a woman little sister” re beca lost control of herself she went ba ck to eating earth and the whitewash on th e walls with the avidity o f previous days and she sucked her finger with so much anxiety tha t she developed a callus on her thumb she vomited up a green liquid with dead leeches in it s he spent nig hts awake sh aking with fever fightin g against delirium waiting until the house shook with the return of josé arcadio at dawn one afternoon when everyone was having a sies ta she could no longer r esist and we nt to his bedroom she found him in his shorts lying in the hammock that he had hung from the beams with a ship’s hawser she was so impressed by his enormous motley nakedness that she felt an impulse to retreat “excuse me” she said “i didn’t know you were here” but she lowered her voice so as not to wake a nyone up “come here” he said rebeca obeyed she stopped beside the hammo ck in an icy sweat feeling knots forming in her intestines while josé arcadio stro ked her ankl es wi th the tips of his finger s then her calves then her thighs murmuring “oh little sister little sister” she had to make a supernatural effort not to die when a s tartlingly regulated cyclo nic power lifted her up by the waist a nd despoiled her of her intimacy with three clas hes of its claws and qua rtered her like a little bird she managed to than k god for having been born before she lost herself in the incon ceivable plea sure of that unbearable pain splashing in the steaming marsh of the hamm ock which absorbed the explosion of blood like a blotter three days later they wer e married during the five o’clock mass josé arcadio had gone t o pietro crespi’s store the day before he found him giving a zither lesson and did not draw him aside to speak to him “i’m going to marry r ebeca” he tol d him pietro crespi turned pale gave the zith er to one of his pupils and dismissed the cl ass when th ey were alone in the roo m that was crowded with musical instruments and mechan ical toys pietro crespi said “she’s your sister” “i don’t care” josé arcadio replied pietro crespi mopped his brow with the hand kerchi ef that was s oaked in lavender “it’s against nature” he explained “and besides it’s against the law” josé arcadio grew impatient not so much at th e argument as over pietro crespi’s paleness “fuck nature two times over” he said “and i’ve come to tel l you not to bother goin g to ask rebeca an ything” but his brutal deportment broke down when he sa w pietro crespi’s eyes grow moist “now” he said to him in a different tone “if you really like the family there’s amaranta for you” father nicanor revealed in his sunday sermon th at josé arcadio and rebeca were not brother and sister úrsula never forgave what she considered an incon ceivable lack of respect an d when the y came ba ck from church she forbade the newlywed s to set foot in the house again for her it was as if they were dead so they rented a ho use across fr om the cemetery and es tablished them selves there with no other furniture but josé arcadio’s hammoc k on thei r wedding night a scorpion that had got into her slipper bit rebeca on the foot her tongue went to sleep but that did not stop them from spending a scandal ous honeymoon the nei ghbors were startled by the cries that woke up the whole district as many as eight ti mes i n a single ni ght and three times during siesta an d they praye d that such wil d passion would not disturb the peace of the dead aureliano was the o nly one who was concerned a bout them he bought them some furniture and gave them s ome money until josé ar cadio recovere d his sense of reality and began to work the no man’sland that bordered the courtyard of th e house amaranta on the other hand never did overcome h er rancor against rebeca even though life offere d her a satisfaction of which she had not dreamed at the initiative of úrsula who did not know how to repair t he shame pietro crespi continued having lunch at the house on tuesdays rising above his defea t with a seren e dignity h e still wore the black ribbon on his hat as a sign of respect f or the family and he took pleasure in showing his affection for úrsula by bringing her ex otic gifts portuguese sardines turkish rose marmalade and on one occasion a l ovely manila sh awl ama ranta looked after him with a loving diligence she anticipated his wants pulled out the th reads on the cuffs of his shirt and embroidered a dozen handkerchiefs with his initials for his bi rthday on tu esdays after lunch while she would embroider on the porch he would keep her happy comp any for pietro crespi that woman who m he always ha d considered and treated as a child was a revelation although her tempera ment lacked grace she had a rare sensibility for appreciating the things of the world and had a secret tenderness one tuesday when no one doubted that sooner or later it had to happen pietr o crespi asked her to marry him she did not stop her work she waited for the hot blush to leave her ears and gave her voice a seren e stress of maturity “of course crespi” she said “but when we know each oth er better it’s n ever good to be has ty in things” úrsula was confused in spite of the esteem sh e had for pietro crespi she could not tell whether his decision was good or bad from the moral point of view after hi s prolonged and famou s engagement to rebeca but she finally accepted it as an unqualified fact because no one shared her doubts aureliano who was the man o f the house c onfused her further with his enigmatic and final opinion “these are not times to g o around thinking about weddings” that opinion which úr sula understood only some mon ths later was the only sincere one that aureliano could express at that moment not only wi th respect to marriage but to anything that was not war he himself facing a firing squad woul d not understand too well the concatenation of the series of subtle but irrevocable accidents that brou ght him to t hat point the death of remedios had not produced the despai r that he had feared it was rather a dull feeling of rage that grades ally dissolved in a solitary and passive frustration simila r to the one he had felt during the time he was resigned to living without a woman he plunged into his work again but he kept up the custom of playing dominoes with his fatherinlaw in a house bound up in mourning the nightly conversation s consolidated the friendship between the two men “get married again aurelito” his fatherinlaw would tell him “i have six daughter s for you to choose from” on one occasion on the eve of the elections don apolinar moscote retur ned from one of his freque nt trips worried about the political situation in the country the liberals were deter mined to go to war since aureliano a t that time had very confused notions about th e difference between conservatives and liberals his fatherinlaw gave him some schemati c lessons th e liberals he said were freemasons bad people wanting to hang priests to institute civil marriage and divorce to recognize the rights of illegitimate children as equal to those of legitimate ones and to cut the country up into a federal system tha t would take power away from the supreme authorit y the conservatives on the other hand who had received thei r power directly from god proposed the establishment of p ublic order and family morality th ey were th e defenders of the faith of chr ist of the principle o f authority a nd were n ot prepared to permit the country to be broken down into autonomou s entities b ecause of hi s humanitarian feelings aureliano sympa thized with the liberal attitude with r espect to the rights of natural children but in a ny case h e could not understand h ow people a rrived at the extreme of waging war over things that could no t be touched with the ha nd it seemed an exaggeration to him that for the elections hi s fatherinlaw had th em send six soldiers armed with rifles under th e command of a sergeant to a town with no political passions they not only arrived but they went from house to house confiscating hunting weapons machetes and even kitchen knives before they distributed among males over twentyone the bl ue ballots with the nam es of the c onservative candidates a nd the red ballots with the names of the liberal candidates on the eve of the election s don apolinar moscote himself read a decree that pr ohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages and the gathering together of m ore than three people w ho were no t of the sam e family the elections to ok place with out incident at eight o’clock on sunday morning a wooden ball ot box was set up in the square which was watched over by the six soldiers the voting was absolutely free as aureliano himself was able to a ttest since he sp ent almost th e entire da y with his fath erinlaw seeing that no one voted more than once at four in the after noon a roll of drums in the square announced the closing of the polls and don apolinar moscote se aled th e ballot box with a label crossed by hi s signature that night whil e he pla yed d ominoes wi th aureliano he ordered th e sergeant to break th e seal in order to count the votes there were almost as many red ballots as blue but the sergeant left only ten red ones and made up the dif ference with blue ones t hen they seal ed the box a gain with a new label and the first th ing on the f ollowing day it was taken to th e capital of the pro vince “the liberals will go to war” aurelia no said don apolinar concentrated on his domino pieces “if you’re saying that because of the switch in ballots they won’t” he said “we left a few red ones in so there won’t be any complaints” aureliano understood the disadvantages of being in the opposition “if i were a liberal” he said “i’d go to war because o f those ballots” his fatherinlaw looked at him over his glasses “come now aurelito” he said “if you were a libe ral even though you’re my soninlaw you wouldn’t have seen th e switching of the ballots” what really caused indignation in th e town was n ot the results of the elections but the fact tha t the soldiers had not retu rned the weapons a grou p of women spoke wi th aureliano so that he could obtain the return of their kitchen knives from his fatherinlaw don apoli nar moscote explained to him in stric test c onfidence that the s oldiers had ta ken the weapons off as proof that the liberals were prepari ng for war the cynicis m of the remark alarmed him he said nothing but on a certain night when gerineldo márquez and ma gnífico v isbal were speaking with some other friends about the incident of the knives they as ked him if he was a liberal or a conservative aureliano did not hesitate “if i have to be something i’ll be a liberal” he said “because the conservatives are tricky” on the following day at the urging of his friends he wen t to see dr alirio noguera to be trea ted for a supposed pain in his liver he did not even understand the meaning of the subterfuge dr alirio nogu era had arrived in macondo a few years before wit h a medicine chest of tasteless pills and a medical motto tha t convinced no one one nail draw s another in rea lity he was a charlatan behind his innocent façade of a doctor without pr estige there was hidden a terrorist who with his short legged boots covered the scars that five years in the stocks had left on his legs ta ken prisoner during the first federalist adventure he managed to escape to curaçao disguised in the garment he detested mo st in this world a cassock at the en d of a prolonged exile stirred up by the excitin g news that exi les from all over the caribbean brou ght to curaçao he set out in a smuggler’s schooner and appeared in riohacha with the bottles of pills that were nothing but refined sugar a nd a diploma from the university of leipzig that he had forg ed himself he wept with disappointment the fed eralist fervor which the exiles had pictured as a p owder keg about to expl ode had dissolved into a vague electoral illusion e mbittered by failure yearning for a sa fe place where he could a wait old age the false homeopath too k refuge in macondo in the narrow bottlecrowd ed room that he rented o n one side of the square he lived sever al years off the hopelessl y ill who after having tried everything consoled themselves with sugar pills his instincts of an agitator remained dormant as long as don apolinar moscote was a figurehead he passed the time remembering and fighting against asthma the approach of the elections was th e thread that led him once more to the skein of subversion he made con tact with the yo ung peopl e in the town who lacked politic al knowledge and he embarked on a steal thy campaign of instigation the numer ous red ballots that app eared is the box and that were attributed by don apolinar moscote to the cu riosity that came from youth were part of his plan he made his disciples vote in order to s how them th at elections were a farce “the only effective thing” he would say “is violence” th e majority of aureliano’s friends were enthusiastic over the idea of liquidating the conservative esta blishment but no one had dared include him in the plans not o nly because of his ties with the ma gistrate but because of his solitary and elusive character it was known furthermore that he had voted blue at his fatherinlaw’s direction so it was a simple matter of ch ance tha t he revealed his po litical sentiments and it was purely a matter of curiosity a caprice that brought him to visit the doctor for the treatment of a pain th at he did not have in the den that smelled of camphorated cobwebs he found himself facing a kind of dusty iguana whose lungs whistled when h e breathed before asking him any questions the doctor too k him to the window and examined the inside of his lower eyelid “it’s not there” aureliano said following what they told him he pushed the tip s of his fingers into his liver and added “here’s where i have the pain that won’t let me sleep” then dr noguera closed the win dow with th e pretext that there was to o much sun and explained to him in simple terms that it was a patriotic duty to assassinate conservatives fo r several days aureliano carried a small bottle of pills in his shirt pocket he would take it out ev ery two hour s put three pills in the palm of his hand and pop them into hi s mouth for them to be s lowly di ssolved on his tongue don apolinar moscote made fun of his fa ith in homeopathy but those who were in on the plot recognized another one of their people in him almost all of the sons of the fo unders were implicated although none of them knew concretely what action th ey were pl otting nevertheless the d ay the do ctor revealed the secret to aureliano the latter elicited the whol e plan of th e conspiracy although h e was convinced at tha t time of the u rgency of liquidating the conservative regime the plot horrified him dr noguera had a mystique of personal assassination his system was reduced to coordina ting a series of individua l actions which in one ma ster stroke covering the whole natio n would liquidate the fun ctionaries of the regime along with t heir respective families especially the children in order to exterminate conservatism at its roots don apol inar moscote his wife and his six daughters needless to say were on the l ist “you’re no liberal or anything else” aureliano to ld him witho ut getting excited “you’re nothing but a butcher” “in that case” the docto r replied with equal calm “give me back the bo ttle you don’t need i t any more” only six months later did aureliano learn that th e doctor had given up on him as a man of a ction because he was a sentim ental person with no future with a passive character and a definite solitary vocation they tried to keep him surrounded fearin g that he would betray the conspiracy aureliano calmed them down he would not sa y a word but on th e nigh t they went to murder the moscote family they would find him guarding the door he showed such a convinci ng decision that the plan was postpon ed for an in definite date it was during those days that úrsula asked his opinion about the marriage between pietro crespi and amaran ta an d he answered that these were not times to be thinking about such a thi ng for a week he had been carrying an oldfashioned pistol under his shirt he kept his eyes on his friends in the afternoon he would go have coffee with josé arcadio and rebeca who had begun to put their house in o rder and from seven o’ clock on he would play dominoes wi th his fatherinlaw at lunchtime he wa s chatting with arcadio who was alr eady a huge adolescent and he found him more a nd more exci ted over the imminence of war in sc hool where arcadio had pupils older than himself mixed in wi th children who were barely beginning to talk the liberal fever had caught on there was talk of shoot ing father nicanor of turning the church into a school of instituting free love aureliano tried to calm down his drive he recommended discretion and prudence to him deaf to his calm reasoning to his sense of reality arcadio reproached him in public for his weakness of character aureliano waited finally in the beginning of december úrsula burst into the wor kshop all upset “war’s broken out” war in fact had broken out three mo nths before martial law was in effect in the whole country the only on e who knew it immediately was don apo linar moscote but he did not g ive the news even to his wife while the army platoon that was to occupy the town by surprise was on its way they entered noiselessly before dawn with two pieces of light artillery drawn by mules and they set up their headquarters in the school a pm curfew was esta blished a more drastic search than the previous one was undertaken house by house and this time they even took farm implements they dragged out dr noguera tied him to a tree in th e square and shot him without any due process of law father nicanor tried to impress the military authorities with the mir acle of levitation and had his head split open by the butt of a sol dier’s rifle the liberal ex altation had been extingu ished into a silent terror aureliano pale mysteri ous contin ued playing dominoes with his fatherinlaw he understood that in spite of his present title of civil and military leader of the town don apolinar moscote wa s once more a figurehead the decisions were made by the a rmy captain who each morning collected an extraordinary levy for the defe nse of public order four soldiers under hi s command sn atched a wo man who had been bitten by a mad dog from her family and killed her with their rifle butts one sunday two weeks after the occup ation aureliano entered gerineldo márquez’s house and with his usual terseness asked for a mug of coffee without sugar when the two of them were alone in the kitchen aureliano ga ve his voice an au thority that had never been heard before “get th e boys ready” he said “w e’re going to war” ger ineldo márquez did no t believe him “with what weapons” he asked “with theirs” aureliano replied tuesday a t midnight in a mad operation twentyone men under the age o f thirty com manded b y aureliano b uendía arm ed with tabl e knives an d sharpened tools took the garrison by surprise seized the weapons and in the courtyard executed the captain and the four soldiers wh o had killed the woman that same night while the sound of the firing squad could be heard arcadio was named civil and military leader of th e town the married reb els barely had time to take leave of t heir wives whom they left to their our devices they left at dawn cheered by the people who had been liberated from the terror to join the forces of the revolutionary general victorio m edina who according to the lates t reports was o n his wa y to manaure before leaving aureliano br ought don apolinar moscote out o f a closet “rest easy fa therinlaw” he told him “the new government guarantees on its word of honor your personal saf ety and that of your family” d on apolinar moscote ha d trouble identifying that conspirato r in high boots and wi th a rifle slung over his shoulder with the person he had played dominoes with until nine in the evening “this is madness aurelito” he exclaimed “not madness” aurelian o said “war and d on’t call me aurelito any more now i’m colonel aureliano buendía” chapter colone l aurelia no buendía organized thirtytwo armed uprising s and he lost them all he had seventeen m ale children by seventeen different women and they were exterminated o ne after the other on a single night before the oldest one had reached the age of thirty five he survived fourteen attemp ts on his life se ventythree ambushes and a firing squad he lived through a dose of strychnine in his coffee that was eno ugh to kill a horse he refused the order of merit which the president of the r epublic awarded h im he rose to be com mander in c hief of the r evolutionary forces with jurisdiction and comman d from one bor der to th e other and the man most feared by the government but he never let himself be photog raphed he declined the lifetime pension offere d him after the war and until old a ge he mad e his living from the little gold fishes that he manufactured in his workshop in macondo although he always fought at the head of his men the only wound that h e received was the one h e gave himself after signing the treaty of neerlandia which put a n end to alm ost twenty years of civil war he shot himself in the chest with a pistol and the bullet ca me out through his back without dam aging any vit al organ the only thing le ft of all that was a street that bore his name in ma condo and yet as he d eclared a few years before he died of old age he had not expected an y of that on the da wn he left with his twentyone men to join the forces of general victorio medina “we leave macondo in yo ur care” was all that h e said to arcadio before leav ing “we leave it to you in good shape try to have it in better shape wh en we return ” arcadio gave a very personal interpretation to th e instructions he invented a uniform with the braid and epaulets of a m arshal inspired by the prints in one of melquíades’ books and around his waist he buckled the saber with gold tassels that ha d belonged to the executed captain he set up th e two artillery pieces at the entrance to town put uniforms on his form er pupils w ho had been amused by his fiery proclamations and let them wand er through the streets armed in order to give outsiders an impression of invulnerability it wa s a doubleedged deception for the government did not dare a ttack the place for ten mon ths but when it did it unleashed such a large force against it that resistan ce was liquidated in a h alf hour from the first day of his rule arcadio revealed his predilection for decrees he would read as man y as four a day in order to decree an d institute everything that came into his head he imposed obligatory military service for men over eighteen declared to be public property any a nimals walkin g the streets after six in the evening and mad e men who were overage wear red armbands he seque stered father nicanor in the parish house under pain of execution and prohibited him from sayi ng mass or rin ging the bells unless it was for a liberal victory in order that no one would doubt th e severity of his aims he ordered a firing squad organized in the square and had it s hoot at a s carecrow at first no one t ook him ser iously they were after all schoolchildren playing at being gr ownups but one night when arcadio went into catarino’s store the tru mpeter in th e group greeted him with a fanfare that made th e customers laugh and ar cadio had hi m shot for di srespect for the authorities people wh o protested were put on bread and water with their ankles in a set of st ocks that he had set up in a school room “you murderer” úrsula would shout at him every tim e she learned of some n ew arbitrary act “when aureliano finds out he’s going to shoot you and i’ll be the first one to be glad” but it w as of no use arcadio con tinued tightening the tourniquet with unnecessary rigor until he becam e the cruelest ruler that macondo had ever known “now let th em suffer the difference” don apolinar moscote said on one occasion “this is the liberal paradise ” arcadio found out about it at the head of a patrol he assaulted th e house destro yed th e furnit ure flogged the daughters and dragged out don apolinar moscote when úrsula burst into the courtya rd of headquarters after having gone through the to wn sh outing sham e and brand ishing with rage a pitch covered wh ip arcadio himself was preparing to give the squad the command to fire “i dare you to bastard” úrsula shouted before arca dio had tim e to read sh e let go with the first b low of the l ash “i dare you to murderer” s he shouted “and kill me too son of an evil mother that way i won’t have the eyes to weep for the shame of having raised a monster” whipping him without mercy she chased him to the back of the courtyar d where arcadio curled up like a snail in its shell don apolinar moscote was unconscious tied to the post wh ere previously they had ha d the scarecrow that h ad been cut to pieces b y shots fired in fun the boys in the squad scattered fearful that úrsula would g o after th em too but she did not even look at them she left arcadio with his uniform torn roaring with pain and rage and she untied don ap olinar moscote and to ok him home before leaving the headquarters she released the prisoners from the stocks from that ti me on she was the one who ruled i n the to wn she reestabli shed sunday masses suspended the use of red armbands and abrogated the harebrained decrees but in spite of her strength she still wept over her unfo rtunate fate she felt so m uch alone that she sought the useless company of her husband who had b een forgotten under the ch estnut tree “look what we’ve com e to” she would tell him as the june rains threatened to knock the shelter do wn “look at the emp ty house our children scattered all over the world and the two of us alone again the same as in the beginning” josé arcadio buendía su nk in an aby ss of unawar eness was deaf to her lamentations at the beginning of his madness he would announ ce his daily needs with urgent latin phrases in fleeting clear spells of lucidity when amaranta would bring him his meals he would tell her what bothered hi m most and would accept her sucking glasses and mustard pl asters in a do cile way but a t the tim e when úrsula went to lam ent by his side h e had lost all conta ct with reality she would bath e him bit by bit as he sat on his stool while she ga ve him news of the family “aureliano went to war more than four months ago and we haven’t heard anything abo ut him” she would say scrubbing his back with a soaped brush “josé arcadio came b ack a big man taller than you and all covered with needlework but he only brought sha me to our ho use” she thought she noticed however that her husband wo uld grow sad with th e bad news th en she d ecided to lie to him ‘rou won’t believ e what i’m going to tell yo u” she said as she threw ashes over his excrement in order to pick it up with the sho vel “god willed that josé arcadio and rebeca sho uld get married and now they’re very happy” she got to be so sincere in the decep tion that she en ded up by consoling herself with her own lies “arcadio is a serious man now” she sai d “and very brave and a finelooking young man with his uniform and saber” it was like speaking to a dead man for josé arcadio b uendía wa s already beyo nd the reach of any worry but she insi sted he seemed so pea ceful so indifferent to everything that she d ecided to releas e him he di d not even move from his stool he stayed there exposed to the sun and the rain as if the thongs were unnecessary for a dominion superior to any visible bond kept him tied to the trunk of the ches tnut tree t oward august when winter began to last forever úrsula was finally able to give him a piece of news that sounded like the truth “would you believe it that good luck is still pou ring down on u s” she told him “amaranta and the pianola i talian are going to get ma rried” amaranta and pietro crespi had in fact deepen ed their friendship protected by úrsula who thi s time did not think it nec essary to watch over th e visits it wa s a twilight engagement the italian would arrive at dusk with a gardenia i n his button hole and he would trans late petrarch’ s sonnets for amaranta t hey would si t on th e porch suffocated by th e orega no and th e roses he read ing and she sewing lace cuffs ind ifferent to the shocks and bad news of the war until the mosquitoes made them take refuge in the parlor amaranta’s sens ibility her discreet but en veloping tenderness had been wearin g an invisible web about her fiancé whic h he had to push aside materially with his pale and ringless fingers in order to leave the house a t eight o’clock they had put together a delightful album with the postcards that pi etro crespi received from italy they were pictures o f lovers in lonely parks with vignettes of he arts pierced with arrows and gold en ribbons held by doves “i’ve been to this park in florence” pietro crespi woul d say going through the cards “a person can put out his hand and the bir ds will come to feed” so metimes over a watercolor of venice nostalgia would trans form the s mell of mud an d putrefying sh ellfish of the canals in to the warm aroma o f flowers amaranta woul d sigh laugh and drea m of a second homeland of handsome men and beautiful women who spoke a childlike language with ancient cities of whose past grandeur only the cats among the rubble r emained af ter crossing the ocean in search of it after having confused passion with the vehement stroking of rebeca pietro crespi had found love happiness was accompani ed by pros perity his warehouse at that time occupied almost a whole block and it was a hothouse of fantasy with reprodu ctions of the bel l tower of florence tha t told time with a concert of carillons and music boxes from sorrento and comp acts from china that sang fivenote melodies when they were opened and all the musical instruments imaginable and all the mechan ical toys that could be conceived bruno crespi his younger brot her was i n charge of the store b ecause pietro crespi barely had enough time to take care of the music school thanks to him the street of the turks with its dazzling display of knickknacks became a m elodic oasis where one could forget arcadio’s arbitrary acts a nd the dista nt nightmar e of the war when úrsula ordered the revival of sunday mass pietro crespi donated a german harmonium to the church organized a children’s chorus and prepared a gregorian re pertory that added a note of sple ndor to father ni canor’s quiet rite no one doubted th at he would make amara nta a fortunate mate not pushing their feelings letting thems elves be borne along by the natural fl ow of their hearth they reached a point where a ll that was left to do was s et a wedding date th ey did not enco unter any o bstacles úrsula accused herself inwardly of having twisted rebecca’s desti ny with repeated postpo nements and she was not about to add more rem orse the rigor of the mo urning for remedios had been relegated to the background by the mortifications of the war aureliano’s absence arca dio’s brutality and the expulsion of josé arcadio and rebeca with th e imminence of the weddi ng pietro crespi had hinted that aureliano josé in whom he had stir red up a love that was almost filial would be considered their oldest child everything made amaranta think that she was headin g toward a smooth hap piness but unlike rebeca she did not reveal the slightest anxiety with the s ame patience with which she dyed tablecloths sewed lace masterpieces and embroidered needlepoint peacocks sh e waited for pietro crespi to be unable to bear the urges of his heart and more her day came with the illfated october rains pietro crespi took the sewing basket from her lap and he told her “we’ll get married next month” amaranta d id not tremble at the contact with his icy hands she withdrew hers like a timid little a nimal and went back to h er work “don’t be simple crespi” she smiled “i wouldn’t marry you even if i were dead” pietro crespi lost control of himself he wept shamelessly almost brea king his fingers with desperation but he could not break her down “don’t waste your time” was all that amaranta said “if you really love me so much don’t set foot in this house again” úrsula thought she would go mad with shame pietro crespi exhausted all manner of pleas he went thr ough incredible extremes of humiliation he wept one whole afternoon in úrsul a’s lap and she would have sold her soul in order to co mfort him on rainy nights he could be seen pro wling about the house wi th an umbrel la waiting for a light in amaranta’s be droom he was never better dresse d than at th at time his august head of a tor mented emp eror had acq uired a stran ge air of gra ndeur he begged amaranta’s friends the ones wh o sewed with her on the porch to try to persuade her he neglected his business he would spend the day in the rear of the store writing wild notes which he would send to amaranta with flower petals and dried butterflies and wh ich she would return uno pened he would shut himself up for hours on end to play the zither o ne night he sang macondo woke up in a kind of angelic stup or that was caused by a zither tha t deserved more than this wo rld and a voice that led one to believe that no other person on earth could feel such l ove pietro crespi then saw the lights go on in every window i n town except tha t of am aranta on november second all s ouls’ day hi s brother opened the stor e and found all the lamp s lighted all the music b oxes opened and all the docks striking an interminable hour and in the mids t of that mad concert he found pietro crespi at the desk in the rear with his wrists cut by a ra zor and his hands thrust into a basin of benzoin úrsula decreed that the wake would be in he r house father nicanor was against a religious ceremony and burial in c onsecrated g round úrsula st ood up to him “in a way that neither you nor i can understand that m an was a sai nt” she said “so i am going to bury him against your wishes beside melq uíades’ grave” she did it with the support of the whole town and wi th a magnificent funeral amaranta did no t leave h er bedroom from her bed s he heard úrsula’s weepi ng the steps and whispers of the multitude that inv aded the house the wailing of the mourners and then a deep silence that smelled of trampled flo wers for a long time she kept on smelling pietro crespi’s lavender breath at dusk but she had the strength not to succumb to delirium úrsula abandoned her she did not even raise her eyes to pi ty her on th e afternoon when amaranta went in to the kitchen and put her hand into th e coals of th e stove until it hurt her so much that s he felt no m ore pain but instead smell ed the pes tilence of her own singed flesh it was a stupid cu re for her remorse for several days she went ab out the hous e with her h and in a pot of egg whites and when the burns healed it app eared as if the whites ha d also sc arred over the sores on her heart the o nly externa l trace that th e tragedy left was the bandage of blac k gauze that she put on her burned hand and that she wore until her death arcadio gave a rare display of generosity by decr eeing official m ourning for pietro crespi úrsula interpreted i t as the retu rn of the s trayed la mb but she was mistaken s he had lost arcadio not when he had put on his military uniform but fro m the beginning she thought she had raised him as a son as she had raised rebeca with no privilege s or discrimination nevertheless arcadio was a solitary and frightened child during the insomnia plague in the midst of úrsula’s utilitarian fervor during the delirium of josé arcadio buendía the hermetism of aureliano and the mortal rivalry between am aranta and r ebeca aureli ano had tau ght him to read and write thinking about other things as he would have done with a stranger he gave him his clothi ng so that visita ción could take it in when it was ready to be thrown a way arcadi o suffered from shoes tha t were too lar ge from his patched pan ts from his female butto cks he neve r succeeded i n communicating with anyone better than he did with visita ción and ca taure in their language melquíades was the only on e who really was concern ed with him as he made him listen to his incomprehensible tex ts and gave him lessons in the art of daguerreotype no one imagined how much he wept in secr et and the d esperation with which he tried to revive melquíades with the useless study of his papers the school where th ey paid atten tion to him and respected him and then power with his endless decrees and his glorious uniform freed him from the weight of an old bitterness o ne night in catarino’s store someon e dared tell hi m “you don’t deserve the last name you carry” contrary to wh at everyone expected arcadio did not have hi m shot “to my great honor” he said “i am not a buendía ” those who knew the secret of his parentage tho ught that th e answer meant that he too was aware of it but he had really never been pilar te rnera his m other who had made his blood boil in the darkroom was as m uch an irresistible obsession for him as she had been first for josé arcadio and then for aureliano in spite of her having lost her charms and the splendor of he r laugh he sought her out and found her by the trail of her sm ell of smoke a short time before the war one noon when she was later than usual in coming for her younger son at school arcadio was waiting for her in th e room wher e he was accustomed to take his siesta and where h e later set up the stocks while the ch ild played in the courtyar d he waited in his hammock trembling with anxiety knowing that pillar ternera would have to pass through there she arrived arcadio grabbed her by the wrist and tried to pull her into the hammo ck “i can’t i can’t” pilar ternera said in horror “you can’t imagine how much i wou ld like to m ake you h appy but as go d is my witn ess i ca n’t” arcadio took her by the waist with his tremendous hereditary s trength and he felt the world disappear with th e contact of her skin “d on’t play the saint” he sa id “after all everybody knows that you’re a whore” pilar overcame th e disgust that her miserable fate inspired in her “the children will find o ut” she murmured “it will be better if you leave the bar off the door tonight” arcadio waited for her that night tr embling with fever in his hammock he waited without sleeping listening to the aroused crickets in the endless hours of early morning and the implacabl e telling of tim e by the curl ews more and more convinced that he had been d eceived suddenly when anxiety had broken down into rage the door op ened a few months later facing the firing squad arcadio wo uld relive the wandering steps in th e classroom the stu mbling against benches and finally the bulk of a body in the shadows of the r oom and the breathing of air that was pumped by a heart tha t was not his he stretch ed out his han d and found another ha nd with two rings on the same finger about to go astray in th e darkness he felt the structure of th e veins the pulse of its misfortune and felt the damp palm with a lifeline cut off at the base of the thumb by the claws of death then he realized that this was not the wom an he was wa iting for because she did not smell of smoke but of flower lotion and she had inflated b lind breasts with nipples like a man’s a sex as stony and round as a nut and th e chaotic tender ness of excited inexperience she was a virgin and she had th e unlikely name of santa s ofía de la piedad pilar ternera had paid her fifty pesos half of her life savings to do wh at she was doing arcadio had seen her many ti mes working in her parents’ small food store but he had never taken a good look at her because she had that rare virtue of never existing completely excep t at the opp ortune mom ent but from that day o n he huddled like a cat in the warmth of her armpit she would go to the school at siesta time with the consent of her parents to whom pilar ternera hid paid the other half of her savings later on when the government troops dislodged them from the place where they had m ade love they did it among the cans of lard and sacks of cor n in the back of the stor e about the time that arcadio was named civil and militar y leader they h ad a daughter the only relatives who knew about it were josé arcadio a nd rebeca with whom arcadio maintained close relations at that time based not so much on kinship as on complicity josé arcadio had put his neck into th e marital yo ke rebeca’s firm character the vora city of her stomach her tenacious am bition ab sorbed the trem endous ener gy of her hu sband who ha d been changed from a lazy wom anchasing man into an en ormous work an imal they kept a clean and neat house rebeca would open it wide at d awn and th e wind from the graveyard would come in through the windows and go out through the doors to the yard and lea ve the whi tewashed walls and furniture tanned by the saltpeter of the dead her hunger for earth the cloccloc of her parents’ bones the impatience of her blood as it faced pietr o crespi’s passivity were r elegated to the attic of h er memory all day long she would embroider beside the window withdrawn from the uneasines s of the war until the ceramic pots would begin to vibrate in the cupboar d and she would get up to warm the meal much before the appearance first of the m angy hounds and then of the colossus in leggings and spurs with a doublebarreled shotgun who sometimes carried a deer on his shoulder and almost always a string of rabbits or wild ducks one afternoon at the beginning of his rule arcadio paid them a surprise visit they had not seen him since they h ad left the house but he seemed so friendly and familiar that they invited him to share the stew only when they were h aving coffee did arcadi o reveal the motive behind his visit he had received a complaint against josé arcadio it was said that he had begun by plowing his own yard and had gone straight ahead into nei ghboring lands knocking down fences and buildings with his oxen until he took forcible possession of the best plots of land around on the peasants whom he had not des poiled becau se he was not interested in their lands he levied a contributi on which he collected every saturday with his hun ting dogs and his doublebarreled shotgun he di d not d eny it he based his right on the fact that the usurped lan ds had been distributed by josé arcadio buendía at the time o f the founding and he thought it possi ble to prove that his father had been crazy ever since that ti me for he had disposed of a patrimony that r eally belonged to the family it was an unnecessary allegation because arcadio had not come to do justice he simply offered to set up a registry offic e so that josé arcadio could legaliz e his title to the usurped land under the condition that he delegate to the local government the right to collect the contr ibutions they made an agreement years later when colo nel aureliano buendía exa mined the titles to proper ty he found registered in his brother’s name all of the land between the hill where his yard was on up to the horizon including the cemetery and discovered that during the eleven m onths of his rule arcadio had collected not only the money of the contributi ons but had also collected fees from people for the right to bury their dea d in josé arcadio’s land it took úrsula several months to find out what was already public knowledge because people hid it from her so as not to increase her suffering at first she suspected it “arcadio is building a house” she confided with feigned pride to her h usband as she tried to put a spoonful of calabash syrup into his mouth nevertheless she involuntarily sighed and said “i do n’t know why but all this has a b ad smell to me” later on when she foun d out that arcadio had not only built a house bu t had ordered some viennese furniture she confirme d her suspicion that he was using public funds “you’re the shame of our family name” she shouted at him o ne sunday after mass wh en she saw him in his new house playing cards with his officers arcadio paid no atten tion to her only then di d úrsula know that he had a sixmonthold daughter an d that santa sofía de la piedad with whom h e was living outside of m arriage was pregnant a gain she decided to write to colon el aureliano buendía wh erever he wa s to bring him up to d ate on th e situ ation but th e fastmoving events of those days not only prevented her plans from being carried out they made her regret having conceived th em the war which until then had been only a word to designate a vague and remote circumstance became a concrete an d dramatic real ity around the end of february an o ld woma n with an ashen look arrive d in macondo riding a donkey loaded down with brooms she seemed s o inoffensive that the sentr ies let her pass without any questions as another vendor one of the many who often arrived from the towns in the swamp she went directly to the b arracks arcadio received her in the place where th e classroom used to be and which at that time ha d been transformed into a kind of rearguard encampment with roiled hammo cks hanging on hooks and mats pil ed up in the corners and rifles and ca rbines and even huntin g shotguns sca ttered on the floor the old woman stiffened into a military salute before identifying herself “i am colonel gregorio stevenson” he brought bad news t he last cen ters of liberal resistance according to what he s aid were being wiped out colonel aureliano buendía whom he had l eft fighting in retreat nea r riohacha had given him a messag e for arcadio he should surrender the town without resista nce on the condition th at the lives and property of liberals would be respected arca dio examined that strange messenger who could have been a fugiti ve grandmother with a look of pity “you have brought something in writing naturally” he said “naturally” the emissary answered “i have brough t nothing of the sort it’s easy to understand that under th e present cir cumstances a person can’t carry anythi ng that woul d compromise him” as he was speaking he reached into his bodice and took out a small gold fish “i think that this will be sufficient” he said arcadi o could see that indeed it was one of the li ttle fishes made by colonel aureliano buendía but anyone could have bough t it before the war or stolen it and it had no merit as a safeconduct pass the messenger even went to the extreme of violating a military secret so tha t they would believe his identity he revealed that he was on a mission to curaçao where he hoped to recruit exiles from all ove r the caribbean and acquire arms and supplies sufficient to attempt a l anding at th e end of th e year with faith in that plan colonel aureliano buendía was not in favor of any useless sacrifices at that tim e but arcadio was inflexible he had the prisoner put into the stocks until he could pro ve his identity and he res olved to defend the to wn to the death he did not have long to wait th e news of th e liberal defeat was more and more concrete toward the end of march before a dawn of pr emature rain the tens e calm of the previous weeks was abruptly broken by t he desperate sounds of a cornet and a cannon shot that knocked down the steeple of th e church actually arcad io’s decision to resist was madness he had only fifty poorly armed men with a ration of twenty ca rtridges apiece but amo ng them his former pupils excited by the highsounding proclamations the determinati on re igned to sacrifice their skins for a lost cause in the midst of the tramping of boots contradi ctory commands cannon s hots that made the earth tremble wild shooting and the senseless sound of cornets the supposed colonel stevenson managed to speak to arcadio “don’t let me underg o the indignity of dying in the stocks in these women’s clo thes” he sai d to him “if i have to die let m e die fighting” he succeed ed in convincing him arcadio ordered them to give him a weapon and twenty cartridges and he left him with five men to defend headquarters while he went off with his staff to head up the resistance he did not get to the r oad to the s wamp the barricades had been bro ken and the defenders were openly fighting in the streets first until they used up their ration of rifle bullets then with pistols against rifles and finally hand to hand with the immi nence of defeat some wo men went in to the street armed with s ticks and kitchen knives in that confusion arcadio found amaranta who was looking for him like a mad woman in her ni ghtgown and with two old pistols that had belonged to josé arcadio buendía he gave his rifle to an officer who had been disarmed in the fight and escaped with amara nta through a nearby street to take her home úrsula was in the doorway waiting indifferent t o the cannon shots that had opened up a hole in the front of the house next door the rain was letting up but the streets were as slippe ry and as smooth as melted soap and one had to guess distances in the dar kness arcadio left amar anta with úr sula and m ade an attemp t to face two soldiers who had opened up with heavy firing from the corner the old pistols that ha d been kep t for many years in the bu reau did not work protecti ng arcadi o with her b ody úrsula tried to drag him toward the house “come along in the name of god” she shouted at him “there’s been enough madness” the soldiers aimed at them “let go of that man ma’am” one of them shouted “or we won’t be responsible” arcadio pus hed úrsula toward the house and surrendered a short time later the shooting stopped and the bells began to toll the resistance had been wi ped out in less than half an hour not a single one of arcadio’s men had survived the attack but before dying they had killed three hundred soldiers the la st stronghold was the barra cks before being attacked the supposed colonel gregorio stevenson had freed the prisoners and orde red his men to go out and fight in the street the extraordinary mobility and accu rate aim with which he placed his twenty cartri dges gave the impression that the barracks was welldefended and the attackers blew it to pieces with cannon fire the captain who directed the opera tion was startled to find the rubbl e deserted and a single dead man in his undershorts with an empty rifle still clu tched in an arm that ha d been blown completely off he had a woman’s f ull head of hair held at th e neck with a comb and on his neck a chain with a small gold fish when he turned him over with the tip of his boot and put the light on his face the captain was perplexed “jesus christ” he exclaimed other officers came ov er “look where this fellow turned up” the captain s aid “it’s gregorio stevenson” at da wn after a summar y court m artial arcadio wa s shot again st the wall of the cemeter y in the last two hou rs of his life he did not manage to understand why the fear that had tormented h im since childhood had disappeared impassive withou t even worrying about making a show of his recent bravery he listened to th e interminable ch arges of the a ccusation h e thought ab out úrsula who at th at hour must have been un der the ches tnut tree havi ng coffee with josé arca dio buendía he thought about his eightmonthold daugh ter who still ha d no name and about the child who was going to be born in august he thought about santa sofía de la piedad whom he had left the night before salting down a deer for next day’s lunch and he missed her hair pouring over her shoulders and her eyelas hes which l ooked as if they were ar tificial he thought about his peop le without sentimentality with a strict dosing of his accounts with life beginning to understand how much he rea lly loved the people he h ated most t he president of the courtmartial began his final speech when arcadio realized th at two hours had p assed “even if the proven charges di d not h ave merit enoug h” the president was saying “the ir responsible and criminal boldness with which the accused drove his subo rdinates on to a useless death would be enough to deserve capital punishment” in the shattered school house where for the first time he had felt the secur ity of power a few feet from the roo m where he had come to know the u ncertainty of love arcadi o found the formality of death ridiculous death really did no t matter to him but life did and therefore the sensation he felt when they gave their decision was not a feeling of fear but of nostalgia he did not speak until they asked hi m for his last request “tell my wife” he answered in a wellmodulated vo ice “to give the girl the name of úrsula” he paused and s aid it again “úrsula like her grandmother and tell her also that if the child that is to b e born is a boy they should name him j osé arcadio not for his uncle but for his grandfather” before they took him to the executio n wall father nicanor tried to attend him “i have nothing to repent” arcadio said and he put himself und er the orders of the squa d after drin king a cup o f black coffee the leader of the squad a specialist in summary executions had a name that had much more about it than ch ance ca ptain roque carnicero which me ant bu tcher on the way to the cemetery under the persistent drizzle arcadio sa w that a radiant wednes day was brea king out on the horizon his nostalgia disappeared with th e mist and left an immense cu riosity in its place only when they ordered him to put his back to the wall did arcadio see rebeca with wet hair and a pink flowered dress opening wide the do or he made an effort to get her to recognize him and rebeca did take a casual look toward the wal l and was para lyzed with stupor barely able to react and wave goodbye to arcadio arcadio answered her the same way at that instant the smoking mouths of the rifles were aimed a t him and l etter by letter h e heard the en cyclic als th at melquíades had chanted and he heard the lost steps of santa sofía de la pi edad a virgin in the classroom and in his nose he felt the same icy hardness that had drawn his attention in the nostrils of the corpse of remedios “oh god damn it” he managed to think “i forgot to say th at if it was a girl they should name her remedi os” then all accumulated in the rip of a cl aw he felt a gain all the terror that ha d tormented him in his life the captai n gave the o rder to fire arcadio barely had time to put out his chest and raise his head not understanding where the hot liq uid that burned his thighs was pouring from “bastards” he shouted “long live the liberal party” chapter the war was over in may two weeks before the government made the official announcement in a highsounding proclamation which promised merc iless punishment for those who had started the rebellion colonel aureliano buendía fell prisoner just as he wa s about to reach the western frontier disguised as an indian witch doctor of the twen tyone men who had followed him to war fourteen fell in combat six were wounded an d only one a ccompanied him at the moment of final defeat colonel gerineldo márquez the news of his capt ure was announced in macondo with a special proclamation “he’s alive” úrsula t old her husban d “let’s pray to god for his enemies to show him clemen cy” after thr ee days of weeping on e after noon as she was s tirring some sweet milk candy in the kitchen she heard her son’s voice clea rly in her ear “it was aureliano “ she shouted running toward the chestnut tree to tell her husban d the news “i don’t know how the miracle took place but he’s alive and we’re going to see him very soon” she took it for granted she had the floors of the house scrubbed and changed the posit ion of the furniture one week later a rumor from somewhere that was not supported by any pr oclamation gave dramatic confirmation to th e prediction colonel aureliano buendía had been condemned to death and the sentence would be carried out in macondo as a lesson to the popul ation on monday at tenthirty in the morning amaranta was dressing aureliano josé when she he ard the sound of a distant troop and the blast of a cornet one second before úrsula burst into the r oom with the shout “they’re bringing him now” the troop struggled to subdue the overflowing c rowd with their rifle butts úrsula and amaranta ran to th e corner pushing their way through and then they saw him he looked like a beggar his clothing was torn his hair and beard were tangle d and he was barefoot he was walk ing without feeling the burning dust his hands tied behind hi s back with a rope th at a mounted officer had attach ed to the head of his horse along with him also ragged and defeated they were bringing colonel gerineldo márquez they wer e not sad they seem ed m ore disturbed by the cro wd that was shouting all kinds of insults at the troops “my son” úrsula shouted in the midst of the up roar and she slapped the soldier who tried to hold her back the officer’s horse reared then colonel aureliano buendía stopped tremulous avoided the arms of his mother and fixed a stern look on her eyes “go home mama” he said “get permission from the author ities to come see me in jai l” he looked at amaranta who stood indecisively two steps behind úrsula and he smil ed as h e asked her “what happened to your hand” amaranta raised the hand with the black bandage “a burn” she said and took úrsula away so that the horses would not run her down the troop took off a special guard surrounded the pr isoners and took them to the jail at a tr ot at dusk úrsula visited c olonel aureliano buendía in jail she had tried to get permission through don apolinar moscote but he had l ost all autho rity in the face of the mil itary omnipo tence father nicanor was in bed with hepatic fever the pare nts of colonel gerineldo márquez who had not been condemned to dea th had tried to see him and were driven off with rifle butts facing th e impossibility of finding anyone to intervene conv inced that h er son would be shot at da wn úrsula wrapped up the things she wanted to bring him and went to th e jail alone “i am the mother of colonel aureliano buendía” she announced the sentries blocked her way “i’m going in in any case” úrsula warned them “so if you have orders to shoot start right in” she pushed one of them aside and went into the former classroom where a group of halfd ressed soldiers were oiling their weapons an officer in a field uniform ruddyfaced with very thi ck glasses and ceremonio us manners signaled to the sen tries to withdraw “i am the mother of colonel aureliano buendía” úrsula repeated “you must mean” the o fficer corrected with a friendly smile “that you are the moth er of mister aureliano b uendía” úrsula recognized in his affected way of speaking th e languid ca dence of th e stuckup people from the highlands “as you say mister ” she a ccepted “just as long as i can see him ” there were superior orders that prohibited visits to prisoners condemned to death but the officer assumed the responsibility of letting her ha ve a fifteen minute stay úrsula showed him what she had in the bundle a change of clean clothi ng the short boots that her son had worn at his wedding and the sweet milk candy that she had kept for him since the day she had sensed his return she found colonel aureliano buendía in the room that was used as a cell lying on a cot with his arms spread out beca use his armpits were paved with sores they had allowed him to shave the thick mustache with twisted ends accentuated the sharp angles of his cheekbones he looked paler to úrsula than when h e had left a little taller and more solitary than ever he knew all about the details of the house pietro crespi’s suicide arcadi o’s arbitrary acts and execution the d auntlessnes s of josé arca dio buendía underneath the chestnu t tree he knew that amar anta had con secrated h er virginal widowhood to th e rearing of aureliano josé and that the latter was beginning t o show signs of quite good judgment and that he had learned to re ad and write at the sam e time he h ad learned to speak from the moment in which she entered the r oom úrsula felt inhibited by the maturity of her son by his aura of command by the g low of author ity that radi ated from his skin she was surprised that he was s o wellinformed “you knew all along that i was a wizard” he joked and he added in a serious tone “this morning when they brought me here i had the impression that i had alread y been through all that before” in fact while th e crowd was roaring alongside him he had been concentra ting his thoughts startled at how the to wn had aged the leaves of the almon d trees were broken the houses painted blue then painted red had ended u p with an ind efinable coloration “what did you expect” úrsula sighed “time passes” “that’s how it goes” aureliano admitted “but not so much” in that wa y the longawaited visit for wh ich both had prepared que stions and had even anticipated answers was once more the usual ev eryday conver sation when the guard announced the end of the visit aureliano took out a roll of sweaty pap ers from under the cot they were his poetry the p oems inspired by remedi os which he had taken with him wh en he left and those he had written later on during chance pauses in the war “promise me that no one will re ad them” he said “light the oven with them this very night ” úrsula prom ised and stood up to kiss him good bye “i brought you a revolver” she murmured colonel aur eliano buend ía saw that the sentry could not see “it won’t do me any good ” he said in a low voice “but give i t to me in ca se they search you on the way out” ú rsula took th e revolver out of her bodice and pu t it under th e mattress of the cot “and don’t say goodbye” he concluded with emphati c calmness “don’t beg or bow down to anyone pretend tha t they shot me a long time ago” úrsula bit her lip so as not to cry “put some hot stones on those sores” she said she turned halfway around and left the room colonel aureliano buendía remained standing thoughtful until the do or closed t hen he lay d own again with his arms open since the beginning of adolescence when he had begun to be aware of his premonitions he thought that death would be announced with a d efinite unequivocal irrevoca ble signal but there were only a few hours lef t before he would die and the signal had not come on a certain occasion a v ery beautiful woman had come into hi s camp in tu curinca and asked the se ntries’ permission to see him they let her through because they were aware of the fanaticism of mother s who sent their daughters to the bedrooms of the most fa mous warriors according to wh at they said to improve the br eed that night colonel aureliano buendía was finishing the poem about the man who is lost in the rain when the girl came into his room he turned his back to her to put the sheet of paper into the locked drawer where h e kept his poetry and then he sensed it he grasped the pistol in the drawer without turning his head “please don’t shoot” he said when he tur ned around holding his pistol the gi rl had lowered hers and did not know what to do in that way he had avoided four out of eleven traps on the other h and someon e who wa s never caught entered the revolutionary headquarter s one night in manaure and stabbed to death his close friend colonel magnífico visbal to whom he had given his cot so that he could s weat out a fever a few yards away sleeping in a hammock in the same room he wa s not aware of anything his efforts to systematize his premonitions were useless the y would come suddenly in a wave o f supernatural lucidity like an absolute a nd momenta neous conviction but they could not be grasped on occasion they were s o natural tha t he identifi ed them as premonitions only after th ey had b een fulfilled fre quently they were nothing but ordinary bits of superstition but when they condemn ed him to death and asked him to state his last wish he did not have the least difficulty in identifying the premonition that inspired his answer “i ask that th e senten ce be carried out in macondo” he said the president of the courtmartial was annoyed “don’t be clever buendía” he told him “that’s just a trick to gain more time ” “if you don’t fulfill it that will be your worry” the colonel said “but that’s my last wish” since then the premonitions had abandoned him th e day wh en úrsula visited him in jail after a great deal of thinking he came to th e conclusi on that perhaps death would not be announced that time because it did not depend on chance but on the will of his executioners he spent the night awake torm ented by th e pain of his sores a li ttle before d awn he hear d steps in the hallway “they’re coming” he said to himself and for no reason he thought of josé arcadio buendía who at that mo ment was thinkin g about him under the d reary dawn of the ches tnut tree he did not feel fear or nostalgia but an intestinal rage at the idea that this artificial death would not let him see th e end of so ma ny things tha t he had left unfinished the door op ened and a s entry ca me in with a mug of coffee on the following day at the same hour he would still be doing wh at he was then raging with the pai n in his armpits and the same thing happened o n thursday he shared the sweet milk candy with the guards and put on his clean clothes which were tight for him and the p atent lea ther boots by friday they had still not shot him actually they did not d are carry out the sentence the rebelliousness of the town made the military men think that the execution of colonel aureliano buendía might have serious political consequences not only in macondo but throughout the area of the swamp so they consulted th e authorities i n the capital of the province on saturd ay night while they were waiting f or an answer captain roque carnicero went with some other o fficers to catarino’s place only o ne woman practically th reatened dar ed take him to her room “they don’t want to go to bed with a man they know is going to die” s he confessed to him “no one knows how it will come but everybody is going around saying that the officer who shoots colonel aureliano buendía and all the soldiers in the squad one by one will be murd ered with no escape sooner or later even if they hide at the ends of the earth” captain roque carnicero mentioned it to the other officers and they told their superiors on sunday although no one had revealed it openly although no action on the part of the military had disturbed the tense calm of those da ys the whole town knew that the officers were ready to us e any manner of pretext to avoid res ponsibility for the execution the official orde r arrived in th e monday m ail the execu tion was to be carried ou t within twentyfour hours that night the officers put seven slips of paper into a cap and captain r oque carnicero’s unpeaceful fate was foreseen by his name on the prize slip “bad luck doesn’t have any chinks in it” he said with deep bitterness “i was born a son of a bitch and i’m going to die a s on of a bitch ” at five in the morning he chose the squad by lot formed it in the courtyard and woke up the condemned man with a premonitory phrase “let’s go buendía” he told him “our time has co me” “so that’s what it was” the colonel replied “i was dreaming that my sores h ad burst” rebeca buendía got up at three in the morning when she lea rned that au reliano would be shot she stayed in the bedroo m in the dar k watching the cem etery wall through the halfopened windo w as the bed on which she sat shook with josé arca dio’s snoring she had wa ited all week with the same hidden persistence with which during different times she had wa ited f or pietro crespi’s letters “they won’t shoot him here” josé arcadio told he r “they’ll shoot him at midnight in the barracks so that no one will know who made up the squad and they’ll bury him right there” rebeca kept on waiting “they’re stupid enough to s hoot him he re” she said she was so certain that she had foreseen the way she wo uld open th e door to wave goodbye “they won’ t bring him through the streets” josé arca dio in sisted with six scared so ldiers and knowing that the peo ple are ready for anything” in different to her husband’s logic rebeca stayed by the window “you’ll see that they’re just stupid eno ugh” she said on tuesday at fivein the morning josé arcadio had drunk his coffee and let the d ogs out when reb eca closed the window and held onto th e head of the bed so as not to fall d own “there they’re bringing him” she sighed “he’s so hand some” josé arcadio looked out the window and saw him tremulous in the light of dawn he alrea dy had his b ack to th e wall and his hands were o n his hips because the burning knots in his armpits would not let him lower them “a person fucks himself up so much” colonel aureliano buendía said “fucks himself up so much just so that six weak fairies can kill him and he can’t do anything about it” he repeated it with so much rage that it almost seem ed to be fervor and captain roque carnicero was touched because he tho ught he was praying when the squad took aim the rage had m aterialized into a viscous and bitter substance tha t put his tongue to sleep and made hi m close his e yes then th e aluminum glow of dawn disappeared and he saw himself again in short pants wearing a tie around his neck and he saw his fat her leading him into the tent on a splendid afternoon and he sa w the ice when he heard the shou t he thought that it was the final co mmand to the squad h e opened his eyes with a shudder o f curiosity expecting to meet the incandescent trajectory of the bullets but he only saw captain roqu e carnicero with his arms in the air an d josé arca dio crossing the street with his fearsome shotgun ready to go off “don’t shoot” the captai n said to josé arca dio “you were sent by divine providence” another war began right there captain roque carnicero and his six men left with colonel aureliano b uendía to free the revolutionary genera l victorio medina who had been condemned to death in riohacha they thought they could save time by crossing the moun tains along the trail th at josé arcadi o buendía h ad followed to found macondo but before a week was out they wer e convinced th at it was an i mpossible u ndertaking so they had to follow the dangerous route over the outcroppings with no other muni tions but what the firing squad had they would camp near the towns and o ne of them with a small gold fish in hi s hand would go in disguise in broa d daylight to contact the dormant liberals who would go ou t hunting on the following morning and never return when they saw r iohacha from a ridge in th e mountai ns general victorio medina had bee n shot colonel aureliano buendía’s men proclai med him ch ief of the revolutionary forces of the caribbean coast with the rank of ge neral he assumed the position but refused the promotion and took the stand that he would never accept it as l ong as the cons ervative regime was in power at the end of three months they had succeed ed in arming more than a thousand men but they were wiped out the survivors reached the easter n frontier the next thing that was heard of them was that they had landed on cabo de la vela coming from the sm aller islands of the antilles and a message from the government was sen t all over by telegraph and included in jubilant proclamations thro ughout the country ann ouncing the death of colonel aureliano buendía but two days later a multiple telegram which almos t overtook the previous one announced another uprising on t he southern plains that was how the legend of the ubiquitous colonel aureliano buendía began simultaneous and contradictory information declared him victorious in villanueva defeated in guacamayal devoured by motilón indians dead in a village in the swam p and up in arms again in urumita the liberal leaders who at th at m oment were negotiating fo r participati on in the congress branded him in adventurer who did not represent the party the n ational government placed him in the category o f a bandit and put a price o f five thousand pesos on his head after sixteen defeats colonel aureliano buendía left guajira with two thous and wellarme d indians and the garrison which was taken by surprise as it slept abandoned riohacha he esta blished his headquarters there and proclaimed total war against the regime the first message he recei ved from the government was a threat to sho ot colonel gerineldo márquez within f ortyeight hours if he did not withdr aw with his forces to the eastern frontier colonel roque carnicero who was his chief of staff then gave him the telegra m with a look of consternati on but he read it with un foreseen joy “how wonderful” he exclaimed “we ha ve a tel egraph office in macondo now” his reply wa s definitive in three mo nths he ex pected to es tablish his head quarters in macondo if he did not find colonel gerineldo márquez alive at that time he would s hoot out of hand all of the officers he held prisoner at that moment starti ng with the generals and he would give orders to his subordinates to do the same for the rest of the war three months later when he entered macondo in triumph the first embrace he receive d on the swamp road was that of colonel geri neldo márquez the house was full of children úrsula had taken in santa sofía de la piedad with her older daughter and a pair of twi ns who had been born fi ve months af ter arcadio had been shot contrar y to the victim ’s last wishes she baptized the girl with the nam e of remedios i’m sure that was wh at arcadio mea nt” she alleged “we won ’t call her úrsula because a person suffers too much with tha t name” the twins were n amed josé arcadio segund o and aureliano segundo amaranta took care of them all she put sma ll wooden chairs in the l iving room and establish ed a nursery with oth er children fro m neighboring families when colonel aureliano buendía returned in the midst of exploding ro ckets and ringing bells a children’s chorus welcom ed him to th e house aureliano josé tall like his grandfather dressed as a revo lutionary officer gave him military honors not all the news was go od a year a fter the flig ht of colonel aureliano b uendía josé arcadio and rebeca went to live in the house arcadio had built no one knew about his intervention to halt the execution in the new house located on the best corner of the square in the shade of an almond tree that was honored by three nests of redbreasts with a large door for visitors and four windows for light they set up a hospitable home rebeca’ s old friends among them four of the moscote sisters who were still single once more took up the sessions of em broidery that had been interrupted years before on the porch with the b egonias josé arcadio con tinued to pro fit from the usurped lands the title to which was recognized by the conservative government every afternoon he could be s een returning on horseback with his hunting dogs and his dou blebarreled shotgun and a string of ra bbits hanging from his saddle one se ptember afternoon with the threat of a storm he returned home earlier than usual he greeted rebeca in the dining room t ied the dogs up in the courtyard h ung the rabb its up in the kitchen to b e salted l ater and went to the b edroom to ch ange his clothes rebeca la ter declared tha t when he r husband went into the b edroom she wa s locked in the bathroom and did not hear anything it was a difficult version to believe but there was no other more plausible and no one could thi nk of any moti ve for rebeca to murder the man who had ma de her happy that was perhaps the only mystery that was never cleared u p in macond o as soon as josé arcadio closed the bedroom door the soun d of a pistol shot echoed through the house a trickle of blood came o ut under the door crossed the living room went out into the street continued o n in a straigh t line across the uneven terraces went down steps and climbed over curbs passed along the street o f the turks turned a cor ner to the ri ght and another to the left made a right angle at the buendía house went in under the closed door crossed through the parlor hugging the walls so as not to s tain the rugs went on to the other living room ma de a wide cu rve to avoid the diningroom table went along the porch with the begonias and passed without being seen under amaranta’s chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to aureliano josé and went through the pantry and came ou t in the kitch en where úrsula was getti ng ready to crack thirtysix eggs to make bread “holy mother of god” úrsula shouted she followed the thread of blood back along its course and in search of its origin she went through the pantry along the begonia porch where aureliano josé was chan ting that three plus three is six and six plus three is nine and she crossed the dining room and the li ving rooms and followed straight down the s treet and she turned first to th e right and then to the left to the street of th e turks forgetting that she was still w earing her b aking apron and her house slippers a nd she came out onto the square and went into the door of a house where she had never been and she pushed open the bedroom door and was almost suffoc ated by the smell of burned gunpowder and she found josé arcadio lying face down on the ground on top of the leggings he had just taken off and she saw the starting point of the thread of blood that had alread y stopped flowing out of his right ear they found no wound on his body nor could they loca te the weapon nor was it possible to remove the smell of powder from the corpse first they was hed him three times with soap and a scrubbing brush and they rubbed him with salt and vinegar then with ashes and lemon and finally they put him in a barrel of lye and let him stay fo r six hours they scrubb ed him so m uch that the arabesques of his tattooing began to fade when th ey thought of the desperate measure of seasoning him with pepper cumin seeds and laurel leaves a nd boiling him for a whole day over a slow fire he had already begun to decompose and they had to bury him hastily they sealed him hermetically in a special coffin seven and a half feet l ong and four feet wide reinforced inside with iron plates an d fastened tog ether with steel bolts an d even then the smell co uld be perceived on the streets through which the funeral procession passed father nicanor with his liver enlarged and tight as a drum gave him his blessing from bed although in th e months that followed they reinforced the grave with walls ab out it between which they threw com pressed ash sawdust and quicklime the cemeter y still smelled of powder for many years after until the engineers from the banana company covered the grave over with a shell of concrete as soon as they took the body out rebeca clos ed the doors of her house and buried herself alive covered with a thick crust of disdain that no earthl y temp tation was ever abl e to break s he went out into the st reet on one o ccasion when she was ver y old with shoes the col or of old silver and a hat made of tiny flowers during the time that th e wan dering jew passed through town and brought on a heat wave that was so intense that birds broke through window screens to com e to die in the bedrooms th e last time anyone sa w her alive was when with one shot she killed a thief who was trying to force the door of her house except for argénida her servant and confidante no one ever had any mo re contact with her after that at one time it was discovered that she was writing letter s to th e bish op whom s he claimed as a first cous in but it was never said whether she received any reply the town forgot about her in spite of his triumphal return colonel aureliano buendía was not enthu siastic over the looks of things the government troops abandoned their positions without resistance and that aroused an illusion of victory among the liberal population th at it was not right to destr oy but the revolutionaries knew the truth colonel aureliano buendía better than any of them although at tha t moment he had more than five thousand men under his co mmand and held two coastal states h e had the feeling of being hemmed in against the s ea and caught in a situa tion that was so confused that when he ordered th e restoration o f the chur ch steeple which had b een k nocked down by army cannon fire father nicanor commented from his sickbed “this is silly the defenders of the faith of christ destroy the church and th e masons order it rebuilt” looking for a loophole thr ough which he could es cape he sp ent hours on end in the tel egraph office conferring with the co mmanders o f other towns and every time he would emerge with the firmest impression that the war was at a stalemate when news of fresh liberal victories was received it was celebrated with jubilant proclamatio ns but he would measure the real ex tent of them on the map and could see tha t his forces were penetrating into the jungle defend ing themsel ves against malaria and mosquitoes advancing in the opposite direction f rom reality “w e’re wasti ng time” he would complain to his officers “we’re wasting time while th e bastards in the party are begging for seats in congress” lying awake a t night stretch ed out on his back in a hammock in the same room where he had awaited death he would evoke the image of lawyers dressed in black leaving th e presidential palace in the icy cold of early morning with their coa t collars turned up about their ears rubbing their hands whis pering taking refuge in dreary earlymorning ca fés to specula te over what th e president had mean t when he sai d yes or wh at he ha d meant when h e said no an d even to im agine what the president was thinking when he said something quite differe nt as he chased away mosquitoes at a temperatur e of ninetyfive degrees feeling the approach of the fearsome dawn when he would have to give his men the com mand to jum p into the sea one night of uncertainty when pilar ternera was singing in the courtyard with the soldiers he asked her to read the future in her cards “watch out for your mouth” wa s all that pilar ternera brought out after spreading and picking up the ca rds three tim es “i don’t know what it means bu t the sign is very clear watch out for your mouth ” two days later someone gave an orderly a mug of black coffee and the orderly passed it on to someo ne else and that one to s omeone else until hand to hand it reached colonel aureliano buendía office he had not asked for any coffee but since it was there the colonel drank it it had a dose of nu x vomica strong enough to kill a horse when they took him ho me he was s tiff and arched and his tongue was s ticking out b etween his teeth úrsula fought against death over him af ter cleaning out his stomach with emetics she wrapped him in hot blankets an d fed him egg whites for two days until his harrowed b ody recover ed its norm al temperature on the fourth day he was out of dang er against his will pres sured by úrs ula and his officers he stayed in bed for another week onl y then did h e learn th at his verses had not b een burned “i didn’t want to be hasty” úrsula explai ned to him “that night when i went to light the oven i said to myself th at it would b e better to wait until th ey brought the body” in the haze of convalescence surrounded by remedi os’ dusty do lls colonel aureliano buendía brought back the decisive periods of his existence by reading his poetry he s tarted writing again for many hours balancing on the edge of the surprises of a war wi th no future in rhymed verse he resolved his experience o n the shores of death then his thoughts became so clear that he was abl e to examine them forward and backward one night he asked colonel gerineldo márquez “tell me something old friend why are you fighting” “what other reason could there be” colonel gerine ldo márquez answered “for the great liberal party” “you’re lucky because you know wh y” he answer ed “as fa r as i’m con cerned i’ve come to realize only j ust now that i’m fighting because of p ride” “that’s bad” colonel g erineldo márquez said colonel aureliano buendía was amused at his alarm “naturally” he said “but in any case it’s better than n ot knowing why you’re fighting” he looked him in the eyes an d added with a smile “or fighting like you for something that doesn’t h ave any mea ning for anyone” his pride had prevented him from making contact with the ar med groups in the interior of the country until the leaders of the party publicly recti fied their declaration th at he was a bandit he knew however that as s oon as he put those scru ples aside he would break the vicious circle of the war convalescence gave him time to reflect then he succeeded in getting úrsula to give him the rest of her buried inheritance and her substanti al savings he named colonel gerineldo márquez civil and military leader o f macondo and he went o ff to make contact with the rebel groups in the interior colonel gerineldo márquez was not only the ma n closest to colonel au reliano buendía but úrsula received him as a member of the family frag ile timid with natural good manners he was however better suited for war than for government his political advisers easily entan gled him in theoretical l abyrinths but he succeeded in givi ng macondo the atmosphere of rural peace tha t colonel aur eliano buendía dreamed of so that he could die of old age making little gold fishes although he lived in his parents’ hou se he woul d have lunch at úrsula’s two or three times a week he initiated aureliano josé in the use of firearms gave him ear ly military instruction and for several months took him to live in the barracks with úr sula’s consent so that he could become a man many years before when he was still almost a ch ild gerineldo márquez had declared his love for amaranta at that time s he was so illusioned with her lonely passion for pietro crespi that she laughed at him gerineldo márquez waited on a cer tain occasion he sent amaranta a note from jail asking her to embroider a dozen batis te handkerchi efs with his father’s initials on them he sent her the money a week later amaranta brought the doze n hand kerchiefs to him in jail along with the money and they spent s everal hours talking about th e past “ when i get out of here i’m going to marry you” gerineldo márquez told her when she left amaranta laughed but she kept on thinking about him while she ta ught the chi ldren to rea d and she tr ied to revive her juvenile passion for pietro crespi on saturday visiting days for the prisoners she would stop by the house of gerineldo márquez’s parents and acco mpany them to the jail on one of t hose saturda ys úrsula wa s surprised to see her in the kitchen wa iting for the bi scuits to come out of th e oven so that she coul d pick the best ones and ca p them in a napkin that s he had embr oidered for the occasion “marry him” she told her “you’ll ha ve a hard time finding another man like him” amaranta fei gned a reacti on of displeasure “i don’t ha ve to go around hunting for men” she answered “i’m taking these biscuits to gerineldo because i’m sorry that sooner or later they’re going to shoot him” she said it without thinki ng but that was the ti me that the government had announced its threat to shoot colonel gerineldo márquez if the rebel forces did not surrender riohacha the visits stopped amaranta shut h erself up to weep overwhelme d by a feeling of guilt similar to the one that had tormented her when remedios d ied as if on ce more her careless words had been responsible for a death her mother consoled her she in ured her that colonel aureliano buendía would do something to prevent th e execution an d promised that she would take ch arge of attracting gerineldo márquez herself when the war was o ver she fulfilled her promise before the imagined time when gerineldo márquez returned to the house invested wi th his new dignity of civil and military leader she received him as a son thought of delightful bits of flattery to hold him there and prayed with all her soul that he would remember his plan to marry amaranta her pleas seemed to b e answered on the days tha t he would have lunch at the ho use colonel gerineldo márquez would linger on the begonia porch playing chinese check ers with amar anta úrsula would bring them coffee and milk and biscuits and would take over the children so that they wo uld not both er them am aranta was really making an effort to kindle in her heart th e forgotten ashes of her youthful passion with an anxiety that came to be intolerable she waited for the lunch days the afternoons of chinese checkers and time flew by in the company of th e warrior with a nostalgic name who se fingers trembled imperceptibly a s he moved the pieces but the day on which colonel gerineldo márquez repeated his wish to marry her she rejected him “i’m not going to marry anyone” she told hi m “much less you you love aureliano so much that you wan t to marry m e because yo u can’t marry him” colonel gerineldo márquez was a patient man “i’ ll keep on ins isting” he said “sooner or later i’ll convince you” he kept on visiting the house shut up in her bedroom biting back her secret tears amara nta put her fingers in her ears so as not to bear the voice of the suitor as he gave úrsula the latest wa r news and in spite of the fact that sh e was dying to see him she had the strength not to go out and meet him at that time colonel aureliano buendía took the time to sen d a detailed account to macondo every two weeks but only once almost eight months after he had left did he write to úrsula a special messenger brought a sealed envelope to th e house with a sheet of paper inside bearing th e colonel’s delicate hand take good care of papa because he is going to die úrsula becam e alarmed “if aureliano says so it’s be cause aureliano knows” sh e said a nd she had them help her take jos é arcadio buendía to his bedroom not only was he as heavy as ever but during his prolonged stay under the chestnut tree he had developed the faculty of being able to increase his weight at will to such a degree that s even men were u nable to lift him and they had to dra g him to the bed a smel l of tender mushrooms of woodflow er fungus of old and concentrated outdoors impregnated the air of the b edroom as it was brea thed by the colossal old ma n wea therbeaten by the sun and the rain the next morning he was not in his bed i n spite of his undiminished strength josé arcadi o buendía was in no condition to resist it was all the same to him if he went back to the chestnut tree it was n ot because h e wanted to but because of a habit of his body úrsula took care of him fed him brought him news of aurelia no but actually the onl y person wi th whom he was able to hav e contact for a long time was prudencio aguilar almost pulverized at th at time by the d ecrepitude of death prudencio aguilar would com e twice a d ay to chat wi th him they talked abo ut fighting cocks they promised each other to set up a breed ing farm for magnifice nt birds not so much to enjoy their victories which they wou ld not need then as to have somethi ng to do on the tedious sundays of death it was prudencio aguilar wh o cleaned him fed him a nd brought him splendid news of an unknown person calle d aureliano who was a col onel in the war when he was alone josé arcadio buendía co nsoled himself with the dr eam of th e infinite rooms he dreamed th at he was getting out of bed o pening the d oor and going into an id entical room with th e sam e bed with a wroughtiron head the same wicker chair and the same small picture of t he virgin of help on the back wall from that room he would go into another that was just the same the do or of which would open i nto another that was just the same th e door of which would open into another one just the same an d then into another exactly alike and so on to infinity he liked to go from room to room as in a gallery of paralle l mirrors until prudencio agu ilar would to uch him on the shoulder then he would go back from room to room wal king in reverse going back over his trail and he would find prudencio aguilar in the room of rea lity but one night two weeks after th ey took him to his bed prudencio aguilar touched his shoulder in an intermediate ro om and he stayed th ere forever thinking that it was the real room on the following morning úrsula was bringing him his breakfast when she saw a man comin g along the hall he was short and stocky with a black suit on and a ha t that was also black enormous pulled down to his taciturn eyes “good lord” úrsula thought “i could have s worn it was melquíades” it was cataure visitación’s brother who had l eft the house fleeing from the insomnia p lague and of whom th ere had never been any news visitació n asked him why he had co me back an d he an swered her in their solemn language “i have come for the exequies of the king” then they went into josé arcadio bu endía’s room shook him as hard as they could shouted in his ear put a mirror in front of his nostrils but th ey could not a waken him a short tim e later when the carpenter was taking measuremen ts for the co ffin through the window they saw a l ight rain of tiny yellow flowers fallin g they fell on the town a ll through the night in a silent storm and they covered the roofs and blocked the d oors and smot hered the animals who dept outdo ors so many flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets were carpeted with a compact cushion an d they had to clear them away with shov els and rakes so that th e funeral procession could pass by chapter sitt ng in t he wic ker ro cking chair with her interrupted work in her lap amara nta watched aureliano josé his chi n covered with foam stro pping his razor to give himself his first shave hi s blackheads bled and he cut his upper lip as he tr ied to shape a mustache of blond fuzz and when it was all over he looked the same as before but th e laborious process gave amaranta the feeling that she had begun to grow old at that moment “you look just like aureliano when he was your age” she said “you’re a man now” he had been for a lon g time ever since that distant day when amaranta thought he was still a child and co ntinued getti ng undressed in front of him in the bathroom as she had always done as she had been used to doing ever since pilar tern era had turned him over to her to finish his upbringing the first time that he saw her th e only thing that drew hi s attention was the deep depression between her breasts he was so innocent that he asked her what had hap pened to her and amaran ta pretended to dig into her breasts wi th the tips of her fingers and answered “they gave me some terrible cuts” some time later wh en she had recovered from pietro crespi’s suicide and would bathe with au reliano josé again he no l onger paid attention to the depression but felt a strange trembling at the sight of the splendid breasts with their brown nipples he kept on examining her discovering the miracle of her intimacy inch by inch and h e felt his skin tingle as h e contempla ted the wa y her skin tingled when it tou ched the water ever since he was a s mall child he had the custom of leaving his hammock and waking up in amaranta’s bed because con tact with her was a way of overcoming his fear of the dark but since that da y when he b ecame a ware of his own nakedness it was not fear of the dark that drov e him to crawl i n under her mosquito netting but an urge to feel amaranta’s warm breathing at da wn early one morning during the time when sh e refused colonel gerinel do márquez aureliano josé awoke with the feeling that he could not breathe he felt amara nta’s fingers searchin g across his stomach like warm and anxious littl e caterpillars pre tending to sleep he changed his positi on to make it easier and then he felt the hand without the black banda ge diving like a blind shellf ish into the algae of his anxiety although they seemed to ignore what b oth of them knew and what ea ch one knew th at the other knew from that night on they were yoked togeth er in an inviolable complicity aureliano j osé could no t get to sleep until he heard the twelveo’clock waltz on the parlor dock and the mature maiden who se skin was beginning to grow sad did not have a moments’ rest until she felt s lip in under her mosquito netting that sleepwalker whom she had raised not thinking that he would be a palliative for h er solitude later they n ot only slep t together nak ed exchangi ng exhausting caresses b ut they woul d also chase each o ther in to the corner s of the hous e and shut themselves up in the b edrooms at any h our of the day in a permanent s tate of unrelieved excitem ent they were almost di scovered by úrsula one afternoon when she went into the granary as they wer e starti ng to kiss “do you love your aunt a lot” she asked aureliano josé in an i nnocent way he answered that h e did “that’s good of you” úrsula concluded and finished measu ring the flour for the bread and retur ned to the ki tchen tha t episode drew amaran ta out of her delirium she rea lized tha t she had gon e too far tha t she was no longer playing kissing games with a child but wa s floundering about in an autumnal passion one that was d angerous and had no future and she cut it off with one stroke aureliano josé who was then finishing his military training fin ally woke up to reality and went to sl eep in the barracks on saturdays he would go with the sol diers to cata rino’s store he was seeking consolation for his abrupt solitude for his premature ad olescence wi th women who smelled of dead flowers whom he idealized in the darkness and changed into am aranta by means of the anxious effo rts of his imagination a short time later contra dictory news of the war began to come in while the government itself admitted the progress of the rebellion the officer s in macondo had confidential reports of the imminence o f a negotiated peace toward the first of april a special emissary identified himself to colonel gerineldo márquez he confirmed the fact to him th at the lead ers of the party had indeed established contact with the rebel leaders in th e interior and were on the verge of arranging an armistice in exchange fo r three cabi net posts for the libera ls a minority representa tion in th e congress and a general amnesty for r ebels who lai d down th eir arms the emissary brought a highly confidential order from colonel aureliano buend ía who was not in agreement with the terms of th e armistice colonel gerineldo márquez was to choose five of his best men an d prepare to leave th e country with them the order would be carried ou t with the strictest secrecy one week before the agreement was announced and in the midst of a storm of contradictory rumors colonel aureliano buendía and ten trusted officers among them colonel roque carnicero stealthily arrived in macondo after midnight dismissed the garrison bu ried their weapons and destroyed their records by dawn they had left to wn along with colonel g erineldo márquez and his five officers it was such a quick and secret operation that ú rsula did not find out about it until the last moment when someone tapped on her bedroom window and whispe red “if you want to see colon el aureliano buendía co me to the do or right now” úrsula jumped out of bed and went to the door i n her night gown and she was just ab le to see the horsemen who were leaving town gallop off in a mute cloud of dust only on the following day did she discover that aurel iano josé had gone with his father ten days after a joint communiqué by the gove rnment and the opposition announced the end of the war there was news of the first armed up rising of colonel aureliano buendía on the western border his small and p oorly armed force was s cattered in less than a week but during that year while liberals and conservatives tried to make th e country believe in reco nciliation he attempted seven other revolts one night he bombarded riohacha from a schooner and the garrison dragged out of bed and shot the fourteen bes tknown liberals in the town as a rep risal for more than two weeks he hel d a customs post on the border and from there s ent th e nation a call to g eneral war another of his expecta tions was lost for three mo nths in th e jungle in a m ad attempt to cross more than a thousand miles of virgin te rritory in order to proclaim war on the outskirts of the capital on one occasion he was lea than fifteen miles away from macondo and was obliged by governmen t patrols to hide in the mo untains very close to the enchanted region where his father had found the fossil of a spanish galleon many years before visitación died around that time she had the pleasure of dy ing a natural death after having renounced a throne out of fear of insomnia and he r last wish was that th ey should dig up the wages she had saved for more than twenty years unde r her bed and s end the money to colonel aureliano buendía so that he could go on wi th the war but úrsula did not bothe r to dig it up because i t was rumored in those days that colonel aureliano bue ndía had been killed in a landin g near the provincial capital the official announcement— the fourth in less than two years—was considered true for alm ost six months because nothing furt her was heard of him suddenly when úrsula and amaranta ha d added new mourning to the past pe riod unexpected news ar rived colonel aureliano buendía was alive but apparently he had stopped harassing the government of his country and had joined with the victorious federalism of other repu blics of the caribbean he would show up under different names farther and farther away from his own country later it would be learned that th e idea that wa s working on him at the time was the unification of the federalist forms of central america in order to wip e out conser vative regimes from alas ka to patago nia the first direct n ews that úrsula r eceived from him several years after h is departure was a wrinkled and faded letter that had arrived passing through vari ous hands from santiago cuba “we’ve lost him forever ” úrsula exc laimed on read ing it “if he follows this path he’ll spend christmas at the ends of the earth” the person to whom she said it who was the first to whom she showed the letter was th e conservative general josé raquel moncada mayor of macondo since the end of the war “this aureliano” general moncada commented “what a pity that he’s not a conservative” he reall y admired him like many conservative civilians josé raquel moncada had waged war in defense of his party and had earned the title of general on the field o f battle even though he was n ot a military man by profession on the contrar y like so ma ny of his fellow party members he was an antimilitarist he considered military men unprincipl ed loafers ambitious plotters experts in facing down civilians in order to prosper during times of disorder intelligent pleasant ruddyfaced a man who liked to eat and watch cockfights he h ad been at one time the mos t feared adversary of colonel aureliano buendía he succeeded in imposing his author ity over the career officers in a wide sector along the coast one time when he was forced by strategic circumstances to abandon a stronghold to the forces of colonel aureliano b uendía he left two letters for him in one of them quite long he invited him to join in a campaign to m ake war more human e the other letter was for hi s wife wh o lived in liberal territory and he left i t with a plea to see that it reached i ts destination from then on even in the bloodiest periods of the war the two command ers would arrange truces to exchange prisoners they were p auses with a certain fest ive atmosphere which general moncada took advantage of to teach colonel aureliano buendía how to play chess they becam e great friends they even came to think about the possibility of c oordinating the popular elements of both parties doing away with the influence of the military me n and professional politicians and setting up a humanitarian regime that would take the best from each doctrine when the war was over while colonel aur eliano buendía was sneaking about through the narrow tr ails of permanent sub version general moncada was name d magistrate of macondo he wore civilian clothes replaced the soldiers with unarmed policemen enforced the amnesty laws and helped a few familie s of liberals who had been killed in the war he succeeded in having macondo raised to the status of a municipality and he was therefore its first mayor and he created an atmosp here of confidence that made people think of the war as an absurd nightmare of the past father nicanor consumed by hepatic fever was replaced by father coronel whom they call ed “the pup” a veteran of the first federalist war bruno crespi who was married to amparo mos cote and whose shop of toys and musical instruments conti nued to prosper built a theater which spanish co mpanies incl uded in th eir itineraries it was a vast openair hall with wooden benches a velvet curtain with greek masks and three box of fices in the s hape of lion s’ heads thr ough whose mouths th e tickets were s old it was also about that time that the s chool was rebuilt it was put under the charge of don melchor escalona an old teach er brought from the swam p who made his lazy stu dents walk o n their knees in the limecoated courtyard and made the students who talked in class eat hot chili with the approval of their parents aureliano segundo and josé arcadio segundo t he willful twins of santa sofía de la piedad were the first to sit in the cl assroom with their slates their chal k and thei r aluminum jugs with their names on them remedios who inherited her mother’s pure beauty began to be known as remedios the beauty in spite of time of the superimposed periods of mourning and her accu mulated afflictions úrsula resisted grow ing old aided by santa sofía de la piedad she gave a new drive to her pastry business and in a few years not only recovered the fortune that her son had spent in the war but she once more stuffed with pure gold the gourds buried in the bedroom “as long as god gives me life” sh e woul d say “there will always be money in this madhouse” that was how things were when au reliano josé deserted the feder al troops in nicaragua signed on as a crewman on a germa n ship and appeared in the kitch en of the house sturdy as a horse as dark and longhaired as an indian and with a secr et determina tion to marry amaranta when amar anta saw hi m come in even though he said nothing she knew immediately why h e had come ba ck at the ta ble they did not dare look each other in the face but two weeks after his return in th e presence o f úrsula he set his eyes on hers and said to her “i always thought a lot about you” amaranta av oided him she guarded ag ainst chance meetings she tried not to become separated from remedios the beauty she was asha med of the b lush that cov ered her cheeks on the day her nephew asked her how long she intended wearing the black bandage on her hand for she interpreted it as an allusion to her virginity whe n he arrived she barred the door of her bedroom but she heard his peacef ul snoring in the next room for so many nights that she forgot about the precaution early one morning al most two months after his return she h eard him co me into the bedroom then instead of fleeing instead of shouti ng as she had thought she would she let herself be saturated with a soft feeling of relaxation she felt him slip i n under the mosquito netting as he had done when he was a child as he had always done and she could not repress her col d sweat and the ch attering of her teeth wh en she realized that h e was completely naked “g o awa y” she whispered suffocating with curiosity “go away or i’ll scream” but aureliano josé kne w then what he had to do because h e was no lo nger a child but a barracks animal starting with that night the dull inconsequential battles began again and woul d go on unt il dawn “i’m your aunt” amaranta murmured spent “it’s almost as if i were your mother not just b ecause of my age but because th e only thing i didn’t do for you was nur se you” aureliano would escape at da wn and com e back ear ly in the morni ng on the n ext day each time more excited b y the proof tha t she had not barred th e door he had nit stopped desiring her for a single instant he found her in the dark bedrooms of captured to wns especial ly in the mo st abject one s and he wo uld make her materialize in the smell of dry blood on the band ages of the wounded in th e instan taneous terror o f the danger of death at all times and in all places he had fled from he r in an attempt to wipe out her memory not only through distance but by means of a muddled fury that his companions at arms took to be boldness but the more her image wallowed in the dunghill of the war the more the war resembled amaranta that was how he suffered in exile lo oking fo r a way of killin g her with his own death until he heard some old man tell the tale of the man who ha d married his aunt who was also his cousin and whose son ended up being his own grandfather “can a person marry his own aunt” he asked startled “he not only can do tha t a soldier answered him “but we’re fighting this war against the priests so that a per son can marry his own mother” two weeks later he des erted he found amaran ta more withered than i n his memory more melancholy a nd shy and now really tu rning the last corner of maturity but more feverish than ev er in the darkness of her bedroom and more challe nging than ever in the aggressiveness of her resistance “you’re a brute” amaranta would tell hi m as she was harried by his hounds “you can’ t do that to a poor aunt unless you have a speci al dispensati on from the pope” aureliano josé promised to go to rome he promised to go across europe on his knees t o kiss the sa ndals of the pontiff just so that she would lower her drawbridge “it’s not just that” amaranta retorted “any children will be born with the tail of a pig” aureliano josé was deaf to all arguments “i don’t care if they’re born as armadillos” he begged early one morning vanquished by the unbearable pa in of repressed virility he went to catarino’s he found a woman with flaccid breasts affectionate and chea p who calmed his stomach for some time he tried to apply the treatm ent of disdai n to amaranta he would see her on the porch working at the sewing machine which she had lear ned to operate with adm irable skill and he would not even sp eak to her amaranta felt freed of a reef and she herself did not understand why she started thinking again at that time ab out colonel gerineldo márquez why she remembered with such nostalgia the afternoons of chine se checkers an d why she even desired him as the man in he r bedroom aureliano josé did not realize how mu ch ground he had lost on the night he could no longer bear the farce of indifference and went ba ck to am aranta’s room she rejected him with a n inflexible and unmistakable determin ation and she barred the door of her bedroom forever a few months after th e return of au reliano josé an exuberant woman perfumed with jasmine appeared at the house with a boy of five she stated that h e was the son of colonel aureliano buendía and that she had brought him to úrsula to be baptized no one doubted the origins of that nameless chi ld he looked exactly lik e the colonel at the time he was taken to see ice for the first time the woman said that he had been born wi th his eyes open looking at people with the judgment of an adult and that she was frightened by his way of staring at things without blinking “he’s identical” úrsula said “the only thing mi ssing is for him to m ake chairs rock by simpl y looking at them” they christened him aureliano and with his mother’s last name since the law did not permit a person to bear his father’s name until he had rec ognized him general moncada was the godfather although amaranta insisted that he be left so that she could take over his upbringing his mother was against it úrsula at that time did not know about the custom of sending virgins to the bedroom s of soldiers in the same way that hens are turned loose with fine roosters but in th e course of that year she found out nine more sons of colonel aureliano buendía were brought to the house to be baptized the oldest a strange da rk boy with green eyes who was not at all like his father’s family was over ten years old they broug ht children o f all ages all colors but al l males and all with a look of solitude that left no doubt as to the relationship only two stood out in the group one large for his age made smithereens out of the flowerpots and china b ecause his ha nds seemed to have the property of breaking everything they to uched the other was a blond boy with the same light eyes as his mother whose hair had been left to grow long and curly like that of a woman he entered the house with a great deal of familiarity as if he had been raised there and he went directly to a chest in úrsula’s bedroom and demanded “i want the mechanica l ballerina” úrsula was startled she opened th e chest sear ched among th e ancient an d dusty articl es left from the days of melquíades and wrapped in a pair of stockings she found the m echanical bal lerina that pietro crespi had brought to the house once and th at everyone h ad forgotten about in less than twelve years the y baptized with the name aureliano and the last name of the mother all the sons that the colonel had implanted u p and down his theater of war seven teen at first úrsula would fill their pockets with money and amaranta tri ed to have them stay b ut they finally limited themselves to giving them presents and serving as godmothers “we’ve done our duty by baptizing them” úrsula would say jotting down in a ledger the name and address of the mother a nd the place and date of birth of th e child “aureliano needs wellkept accounts so that he can decide thing s when h e comes back” during lunc h commenting with g eneral moncada about that disconcerting proliferation she expressed the desire for colonel aureliano buend ía to come b ack someday and gather a ll of his sons together in the house “don’t worry dear friend” general moncada sa id enigmatically “he’ll come sooner than you suspect” what gener al moncada knew and what he did not wish to reveal at lunch was that colonel aureliano buendía was already on h is way to h ead up the most prolonged radical and bloody rebellion of all those he had started up till then the situatio n again beca me as tens e as it had been during the months that preceded th e first war the cockfights instituted by the mayor himsel f were suspended captain aquiles ricardo the commander of the garrison took over the exerci se of municipal power the liberals looked upon him as a provocateur “something terrible is go ing to happen” úrsula would say to aureliano josé “don’t go out into th e street after six o’clock” th e entreaties were usel ess aureliano josé just lik e arcadio in other times had ceased to belong to her it was as if his return home the possibility of existing without concerning himsel f with everyda y neces sities had a wakened in him th e lewd an d lazy leanings of his uncle josé arcadio his pa ssion for amaranta had been extinguished without leaving any scars he would drift around playing pool easing his solitude with occasi onal women sacking the hiding places where úrsula had forgott en her money he ended up coming home only to change his clothes “they’re all alike” úrsula la mented “at first they b ehave very well they’r e obedient and prompt and they don’t seem capabl e of k illing a fly but as soon as their beards appear they go to r uin” unlike arcadio wh o had never k nown his real origins he found out that he was the son of pilar ternera who had hu ng up a hammock so that he could tak e his siesta i n her house more than mother and son they were accomplices in solitude pilar ternera had lost the trail of all hope her laugh had taken on the tones of an organ her breasts had succu mbed to the tedium of endless caressing her stomach and her thighs had been the victims of her irrevocable fate as a shared wom an but h er heart grew ol d without bitterness fat talkative with the airs of a matron in disgrace she renounced the sterile illusions of he r cards and found peace and consolati on in other people’s loves in the house where aureliano josé took his siesta the girls from the nei ghborhood would receive their casu al lovers “lend me your room pilar” they woul d simply say when th ey were already inside “of course” pilar would answer and if anyone was pres ent she woul d explain “i’m happy knowing that people are happy in bed ” she never charged for the service she never ref used the favor just as she never refused the countless men who sough t her out even in the twilig ht of her m aturity without givin g her money or love and only occasionally pleasure her five daugh ters who inherited a b urning seed had been los t on the bywa ys of life since adolescen ce of the two sons she managed to raise one died fighting in the forces of colonel a ureliano buendía and the other was wounded an d captured at the age of fourteen wh en he tried to steal a crate of chick ens in a to wn in the s wamp in a certain wa y aureliano josé was the tall dark man who had been promised her for half a century by the king of hearts and like all men sent by the car ds he reache d her heart when h e was already stam ped with the mark of death she saw it in the cards “don’t go out tonight” she told him “stay and sleep here because carmelita montiel is getting tired of asking me to put her in your room” aureliano josé did not ca tch the d eep fee ling of be gging that was in the offer “tell her to wait for me at midnight” he said he went to the theater wher e a spanish compan y was putting on the dagger of the fox which was really zorzilla’s play with the title changed by order of captain aquiles ricardo because the liberals called the conservatives goths only when he handed in hi s ticket at th e door did aureliano jo sé realize th at cap tain aquiles ricardo and two soldiers armed with rifles were search ing the audience “be careful captain” au reliano josé warned hi m “the man hasn’t been born yet wh o can lay hands on me” the captain tried to search him forcibly and aureliano josé who was unarmed began to run the soldiers disobeyed the order to shoot “he’s a buendía” one of them explained blind with rage the cap tain then snatched awa y the rifle stepped into the center of th e street an d took aim” “cowards” he shouted “i only wish it was colonel aureliano buendía” carmelita m ontiel a twentyyearold virgin had just bathed in orangeblossom water and was strewing ros emary leaves on pilar te rnera’s bed wh en the shot rang out aureliano josé had been destined to find with her the happin ess that amara nta had deni ed him to have seven children and to die in h er arms of old age but th e bullet tha t entered his b ack and sha ttered his ch est had been directed by a wrong interpretation of the cards captain aqu iles ricardo who was really the one destined to die that night did indeed die four hours before aureliano josé as won as the shot wa s heard he was brought down by two s imultaneous bu llets whos e origin was never establi shed and a shout of many voices shook the night “long live the liberal party long live colonel aureliano buendía” at twelve o’ clock when aureliano josé had bled to death an d carmelita montiel found that the cards showing her future were blank more than four hundre d men had f iled past the theater and discharged their revolvers into the abandoned bo dy of captain aquiles ricardo a patrol had to use a wheelbarrow to carry th e body which was heavy with lead an d fell apart like a watersoaked loaf of bread annoyed b y the outrages of the regular army general josé raquel moncada used hi s political influence put on his uniform again a nd assumed th e civil and military leadership of ma condo he did not expect however that his conciliatory attitu de would be able to prevent the inevitable the news in september was contradictory while the government announced that it was maintaining control thro ughout the country the liberals wer e receiving s ecret n ews o f armed uprisings in the interior the regime wou ld not admit a state of wa r until it was proclai med in a d ecree tha t had followed a courtmartial which had condemned col onel aureliano buendía to death in absentia the first unit that captured hi m was order ed to carry the senten ce out “this means he’s come back” úrsula said joyfully to general moncada but he himself knew nothing about it actually col onel aureliano buendía had been in the country for more than a month he was preceded by conflicting rumors sup posed to be in the most distant places at the sa me time an d even general moncada d id not believ e in his retu rn until it was officially announced that he had seized two s tates on the coast “congratulations dear friend” he told úrsula sho wing her th e telegram “you’ll soon have him here” úrsula was wo rried then for the first time “and what will you do” she asked general moncada had aske d himself that same question many times “the same as he my friend” he answered “i’ll do my duty” at dawn on the first of october col onel aurelia no buendía attacked macondo with a thousand wellarmed men and th e garrison received orders to resist to the end at noon while general moncada was lunching with úrsula a rebel canno n shot that echoed in th e whole town blew th e front of the municipal treasury to dust “they’re as well armed as we are” general moncada sighed “but besides that they’re fighting because they want to” at two o’clock in the afternoon while the earth trembled with the artillery fi re from both sides he took leave of úrsula with the certainty that he was fighting a losing battle “i pray to god that you won’t have aureliano in the house tonight” he said “if it does happen that wa y give him an em brace for me because i d on’t expect ever to see him again” that night he was captur ed when he tried to escap e from macondo after writing a long letter to colonel aureliano buendía in which he reminded him of their common aim to huma nize the war and he wished him a final victory over the corrupt ion of the militarists and the ambitions of the politicians in both parties on the following day colonel aureliano buendía had lunch with him in úrsula’s house where he was being held until a rev olutionary courtmartial decided his f ate it was a friendly gath ering but w hile the adversaries forgo t the war to remember th ings of the past úrsula had the gloo my feeling that her son was an intru der she had felt it ever s ince she sa w him come i n protected by a noisy military reti nue which tu rned the bedrooms inside out u ntil they were convinced th ere was no danger colonel aureliano buend ía not only accepted it but he gave strict orders that no one shou ld come clos er than ten feet not even úrsula wh ile the members of his escort finished placing guards about the house he was wearin g an ordinary denim uniform with no insignia of any kind and high boots with spurs that were cak ed with mud and dried bl ood on his waist he wor e a holster with the flap o pen and his hand which was always on the butt of the pistol revealed the same wa tchful and resolute tension a s his look his head with deep recessions in the hairline now seemed to have been baked in a sl ow oven his face tanned by the salt of the caribbean had acquired a metallic hardness he w as preserved against imminent old age by a vitality that h ad som ething to do with the cold ness of his in sides he was taller th an when h e had left paler and bonier and he showed the first symptoms of resistance to nostalgia “good lord” úrsula sai d to herself “now he look s like a man capable of anything” he was the aztec sha wl that he brough t amaranta the remembr ances he spo ke of at lunch the funny stories her told were sim ple leftovers from his humor of a different time as soon as the order to bury the dead in a common grave was carried out he assigned colonel roque carnicero the minion of setting up courtsmartial and he went ahead with the exh austing task of imposing ra dical reforms which would not leave a stone of the reestabli shed conservative regim e in place “w e have to get ahead of the politicians in the party” he said to his aides “when they open thei r eyes to real ity they’ll find accomplis hed facts” it was then that he d ecided to review the titles to land that went ba ck a hundred years and he discovered the legalized outrages of his brother josé arcadio he annulled the registrations with a stroke of the pen as a la st gesture of courtesy he left his affairs for an ho ur and visited rebeca to bring her up to date on what he was d etermined to do in the shado ws of her ho use the solitary widow w ho at on e time had b een the co nfidante of his repressed loves and whose persistence had saved hi s life was a specter out of the past encased in black down to her knuckles with her heart turned to ash she scarcely knew anything about the war colonel aur eliano buend ía had the impression that the phosphorescence of her bones was showing through her skin and that she moved in an atmosphe re of saint elmo’s fire in a stagnant air where one could still note a hidden smell of gunpowder he be gan by advising her to moderate the rigor o f her mourning to ventilate the house to forgive the world for t he death of josé arcadio but rebeca was already beyond an y vanity after searching for it uselessly in the taste o f earth in th e perfumed letters from pietro crespi in the tem pestuous bed of her husband she had found peace in tha t house where memories materialized through the stre ngth of implacable evocation and walked like human bein gs through the cloistered rooms leanin g back in her wicker rocking chair looking at colonel aureliano buendía as if he were the one w ho looked like a ghost out of the past rebeca was not even upset b y the news that the lands usurped by jos é arcadio would be retu rned to th eir rightful own ers “whatever you decide will be done aureliano” sh e sighed “i always thought and now i have the proof that you’re a renegade” the revision of the deed s took place at the same time as th e summary courtsmartial presided over by col onel gerinel do márquez which end ed with th e execution of all officers of the regular army who had been taken prisoner by the revolutiona ries the last courtmartial was that of jos é raquel moncada úrsula intervened ‘”his govern ment was th e best we’ve ever had in macon do” she told colonel aureliano buendía “i don’t have to tell you anything about his good heart abou t his affection for us because you kno w better th an anyone” colonel aureliano buen día gave her a disapproving look “i can’t take over the job of admi nistering justice” he replied “if you have something to say tell it to the cour tmartial” úrsula not only did that she also brought all of the mothers of the revolutionary officers who lived in macondo to testi fy one by o ne the old women who h ad been foun ders of the town several of whom had taken part in the daring crossing of the mountains praised the virtues of general moncada úrsula was th e last in line her gloomy dignity the weight of her name th e convincing vehemence of her declar ation mad e the scale of j ustice hesitate for a moment “you have taken this horrible game very seriously and you have done well because you are doing your duty” she told the members of the court “but don’t forget that as long as god gives us life we will still be mothers and no matter h ow revolutionary you may be we have the right to pull down your pants and give you a whipping at the first sign of disrespect” the cour t retired to d eliberate as those words sti ll echoed i n the school that had been turned into a barracks at midnight general josé raquel moncada was sentenced to death colonel aureliano buendía in sp ite of the violent recrimination s of úrsula refused to commute the sentence a short while befo re dawn he visited th e condemn ed man in th e room used as a cell “remember old friend” he told him “i’m not shooting you it’s the revolution that’s shooting you” general moncada did no t even get up from the cot when he s aw him come in “go to hell friend” he a nswered until that m oment ever since his return col onel aureliano b uendía had not given himself the opportunity to see him with his hear t he was startled to see how much he had aged how his hands shook and the rather punctilious conformity with whic h he awaited death and then he felt a great disgust with himself which he mi ngled with the beginnings of pity “you know better than i ” he said “that all courtsm artial are farces and that you’re reall y paying for the crim es of other p eople because this tim e we’re going to win th e war at an y price wouldn’t you have do ne the sam e in my place” general moncada got up to clean his thick hor nrimmed glasses on his shirttail “probably” he said “but what worries me is not your shooting me because after all for people like u s it’s a natural death” he laid his glasses on the bed and took off his watch and chain “w hat worries me” he wen t on “is that out of so much hatred for the military out of fighting them so much and thinking about them so much you’ve ended up as bad as they are and no ideal in li fe is worth that much baseness” he took off his wedding ring and the medal of the virgin of help and put them alongside his glasses and watch “at this rate” he concluded “you’ll not only be the most despotic and bloody dictator in our history but you’ll shoot my dear friend úrsul a in an attempt to pacify your conscience ” colonel aureliano buendía stood there impassively general moncada then gave him the glasses medal watch and ring an d he changed his tone “but i didn’t send for you to scold yo u” he said “i wanted to ask you the f avor of sending these things to my wife” colonel aureliano buendía put them i n his pockets “is she still in manaure” “she’s still in manaure” general m oncada confir med “in the same house behind the church where you sent the letter” “i’ll be glad to josé raquel ” colonel aureliano buendía said when he went out into the blue air of the mist his face grew damp as on some other dawn in the past and onl y then did he realize th at he had order ed the s entence to be carried out in th e courtyar d and not at the cemetery wall the firing squad drawn up opposite the door paid him the honors of a head of state “they can bring him out now” he ordered chapter colone l gerineldo márque z was the first to perceive th e emptiness of the war in his position as civil and military leader of macondo he would have telegra phic conversations twi ce a week with colonel aureliano buendía at first those excha nges would determine th e course of a fleshand blood war the perfectly defined outlines of which told them at any momen t the exact s pot where it was and the prediction of its future direction alth ough he nev er let himsel f be pulled into the area of confidences not even by his closest friends colonel aureliano buendía still had at that time th e familiar tone that made it possible to identify him at the other end of the wi re many times he would prolong the talk beyond the expected limit and let them drift i nto comm ents of a domestic nature little by little however and as the war became m ore intense a nd widespread his image was fading away into a universe of unreality the characteri stics of his speech were m ore and more uncertain and they ca m together and combined to form word s that were gradually losing all meaning colone l gerineldo márquez limited himself then to just liste ning burdened by the impression that he was i n telegraphic contact with a stranger from another world “i understand aureliano” he would conclude on the key “long live the liberal party” he finally lost all contact with the wa r what in ot her times ha d been a real activity an i rresistible passion of his youth became a remote point of refe rence for him an emptiness his only refuge was amaranta’s s ewing room he would visit her ever y afternoon he liked to watch her hands as she curled frothy petticoa t cloth in the ma chine that was kept in motion by remedios the beauty they spent man y hours without speaking content with their recipro cal compa ny but while amaranta was inwardly pleased in keep ing the fire of his devoti on alive he was unaware of the secret designs of that indecipherable heart when th e news of his return reach ed her amaranta had been smothered by anxiety but when she saw him enter the house in the middle of colonel aureliano buendía’s noisy escort and she saw how he had been mistreated by the r igors of exile made old by age an d oblivion dirty with sweat and dust smelling like a he rd ugly with his left arm in a sling she felt faint with disillusionment “my god” she thought “this wasn’t the person i was waiting for” on the following day however he came back to the house shaved and clean with his mustache perfumed wi th lavender water an d without the bl oody sling he br ought her a prayer book bound in motherofpearl “how strange men are” she said because she could not think of anything else to say “they spend their lives fighting against priest s and then give prayerbooks as gifts” from that time on even during the most critical days of the war he visited her every afternoon many times when rem edios the bea uty was no t present it was he who turned the wheel on the sewing machine amara nta felt upset by the p erseverance the loyalty the submis siveness of tha t man who was invested with so much authority an d who nevertheless took off his sidearm in the living room so that he could go into the sewing room without weapons but for four years he kept repeating his love and sh e would always find a way to reject him without hurting him for even though she had not succeeded in loving him she could no l onger live without him remedios th e beauty who seemed indifferent to everything and w ho was tho ught to be mentally retard ed was not insensitive to so much devotion and she inter vened in colonel gerineldo márquez’s favor amaranta suddenly disco vered that th e girl she had raised wh o was just entering adolescence was already the most beautiful creature that had even been seen in macondo she felt reborn in her heart the rancor that she had felt in other days for rebeca and beg ging god not to impel her into the extreme sta te of wishing her dead sh e banished h er from the sewing room it was arou nd that time that colonel gerineldo márquez began to feel the boredom of the war he summoned his reserves of persuasion his broad and repressed tenderness ready to give up for amaranta a gl ory that had cost him the sacrifice of his best years but he could not succeed in conv incing her one au gust afternoon overcome by the unbearabl e weight of he r own obs tinacy amaranta locked herself in her bedroom to weep over h er solitude unto death after giving her final answer to her tena cious suitor “let’s forget about each other forever” she told hi m “we’re too old for this sort of thing now” colonel gerineldo márquez had a telegraphic call from colonel aureliano buendía that afternoon it was a routine conversation which wa s not going to bring about any break in the stagnant war at the end colonel geri neldo márquez looked at the desola te streets th e crystal wa ter on the almo nd trees and he found himself lost in solitude “aureliano” he said sadly on the key “it’s raining in macondo” there was a long silence on the line suddenly the apparatus jumped with the pitiless letters from colonel aureliano buendía “don’t be a jackass gerineldo” the signals said “it’s natural for it to be raining in augu st” they had not seen each other for such a long tim e that colonel gerineld o márquez was upset by the aggressiveness of the reaction two months later however when colonel aureliano buendía returned to macondo his upset was changed to stupefaction even úrsula was surprised at how much he had changed he came with no noise no escort wrapped in a cloak in spite of the heat and with three mistresses whom he installed in the same hou se where he spent most of his time lying in a hammock he scarcely read the telegraphic dispatches that repo rted routine operations on one occasion colonel gerineldo márquez as ked him for instructions for the eva cuation of a spot on the border where there was a danger that the conflict would become an intern ational affair “don’t bother me with tr ifles” he ordered him “consult divine providence” it was perhaps the most critical moment of th e war the liberal landowner s who had s upported the revolution in the begi nning had made secret allia nces with the conser vative landowners in order to stop the revision of property titles the politicia ns who supplied funds for the war from exile had publicly repudiated the drastic aims of colonel aureliano buendía but even that withdrawal of authorization did not seem to bother him he h ad not returned to reading his poetry which fille d more than fi ve volumes and lay forgotten at th e bottom of hi s trunk at night or at si esta tim e he would call one of his women to his hammock and obtain a rudimentary satisfaction from her and then he woul d sleep like a stone tha t was not concerned by the s lightest indication of worry only he knew at th at time tha t his confused heart was cond emned to un certainty for ever at first intoxicated by the glory of his return by his remar kable victori es he had peeped into th e abyss of greatness h e took pleasure in keeping by his right hand the du ke of marlborough his great teach er in the art of war whose attire of skins and tiger claws aroused the resp ect of adults an d the awe of children it was then that he decided that no hu man being not even úrsula could com e closer to hi m than ten feet in the center of the chalk circle that his aides would draw wherever he stopped and which onl y he could enter he would decide with brief orders that had no appeal the fa te of the wor ld the first time that he was in manaure after the shooting of general moncada he hastened to fulfill his victim’s last wish and the widow took the glasses the medal the watch an d the ring but she would not let him i n the door “you can’t come in colonel” she told him “you may be in command of your war but i’m in command of my house” colonel aureliano buend ía did not show any sign of anger but his spirit only calmed down when his bodyguard had sacked the widow’s house and reduced it to ashes “watch out for your heart aureliano” colonel ger ineldo márquez would say to him th en “you’re rotting alive” about that time he called together a second assembly of the principal rebe l comma nders he found all typ es idealists ambitious people adventurers those wi th social resentments even common criminals there was even a former conservative functionary w ho had taken refuge in th e revolt to escape a judgment for misappropriation of funds many of them did n ot even kno w why they were fighting in the mids t of that motley crowd whose differen ces of val ues were on the verge o f causing an internal explosion one gloomy authority stood out general tefilo vargas he was a fullblooded indian untamed illiterate and endowed with qui et wiles and a messianic vocation that aroused a demented fa naticism in his men colonel aureliano buendía called the m eeting with the aim o f unifying the rebel comma nd against the maneuvers of the politicians gener al teófilo vargas came forward with his intentions in a few hours he sha ttered the coal ition of betterqualified commanders and took ch arge of the main comm and “he’s a wild beast worth watching” colone l aureliano buendía told his officers “that man is more dang erous to us than the mi nister of war” then a very young captain who h ad always been outstandin g for his timidity raised a cautious in dex finger “it’s quite simple colonel” he propos ed “he has to be killed” colonel aureliano buendía was not alarmed by the coldness of the proposition but by the way in which by a fraction of a second it had anticipated his own thou ghts “don’t expect me to give an order like that” he sai d he did not give it as a m atter of fact but two weeks later gen eral teófilo vargas was cut to bits by mach etes in an a mbush and colo nel aurelian o buendía as sumed the main comm and the sam e night that his authority was recognized by all the rebel commands he woke up in a frigh t calling fo r a blanket an inner coldness which s hattered his bone s and to rtured him even in the heat of the sun would not let him sleep f or several months until i t became a habit the intoxication of power began to break apart under wav es of discomfort searching for a cure against the chill he had the young officer who had proposed the murder of general te ófilo vargas shot his orders were being carried out even before they were given even before he thought of them an d they alwa ys went much beyond wh at he would h ave dared h ave them do lost in the solitude of his immense power he began to lose direction he wa s bothered by the people who cheered him in neighboring villa ges and he ima gined that they were th e same cheers they gave the enemy everywhere he met adolescents who looked at him with his own e yes who spoke to him with his own voice who greeted him with the sa me mistrust wi th which he greeted them and who said they were his sons he felt scattered about multiplied and more so litary than ever he was convinced that his own officers were lying to him he fought with the du ke of ma rlborough “the best friend a person has” he would say at that time “is one who has j ust died” he was weary of the uncertainty of the vicious circle of that eter nal war tha t always found him in the s ame place b ut always older wearier even more i n the posi tion of not kno wing why o r how or ev en when th ere was alwa ys someon e outside of the chalk circl e someone who need ed money someone who had a son wi th whooping cough or someone who wanted to go off and sleep forever because he cou ld not stand the shit taste of the war in his mouth and who nevertheless stood at attention to inform him “everything normal colonel” and normality was precisely the most fearful part of that infinite war nothing ever happened alone abandoned by his premonitions fleeing the c hill that was to accompany him until death he sought a last re fuge in macondo in th e warmth of his oldest memories his indolence wa s so serious that when they announced the arrival of a commission from his party that was authorized to discuss th e stalemate o f the war he rolled ov er in his hammo ck without completely waking up “take them to the whores” he said they were six lawyers in frock coats a nd top hats who endured the violent november sun with stiff stoicism úrsula put them up in her house they spent the greater part of the day closeted in the bedroom in hermetic co nferences an d at dusk they asked for an escort an d some acco rdion players and took over catarino’s store “leave them alone ” colonel aureliano buendía ordered “after all i know wha t they wan t” at th e beginning of dece mber the lon gawaited interview which many had foreseen as a n interminab le argument was resolved in less than an hour in the hot p arlor beside the specter o f the pia nola shrouded in a white sheet colonel aureliano buendía did not sit down that time in side the ch alk circle that his aides had drawn he s at in a chai r between his political advisers and wrapped in his woolen blanket he listened in silence to the brief proposals of the emissaries they asked first that he renounce the revision of property titles in order to get back the support of the liberal landowners they asked secondly that he renounce the fight against clerical influence in order to obtain the support of the catholic masses they as ked finally that he renounce the aim of equal rights for natura l and illegitimate children in order to preserve the integrity of the home “that means” colonel aureliano buendía said sm iling wh en the reading was over “that all we’re fightin g for is powe r” “they’re tactical changes ” one of the delegates re plied “right now the mai n thing is to broaden the popular base of the war then we’ll have another look” one of colonel aureliano buendía’s political advisers hastened to intervene “it’s a contradiction” he said “if these changes are good it m eans that the conservative regime is good if we succeed in broadening the popular ba se of the war with them as you people say it means that the regime his a broad popular base it means in short that for almost twenty years we’ve been fighting against the sen timents of the na tion” he was going to go on but colonel aureliano bue ndía stopped him with a signal “d on’t was te your time doctor” he said “the important thin g is that from now on we’ll be fighting only for power” still smiling he took the documents the de legates gave him and made ready to sign them “since that’s the way i t is” he concluded “we have no objectio n to acceptin g” his men looked at one another in consterna tion “excuse me colonel” colonel gerineldo márquez said softly “but this is a betrayal” colonel aur eliano buendía held the inked pen in th e air and discharged the whole weight of his authority on him “surrender y our weapons ” he ordered colonel gerineldo márquez stood up and put his sidearms on the table “report to the barracks” colone l aureliano buendía ordered him “put yourself at the disposition of the revolutionary court” then he signed the declaration and ga ve the shee ts of paper to the emissaries saying to them “here an yo ur papers gentlemen i h ope you can get some adv antage out of them” two days later colonel gerineldo márquez accu sed of high treason was condemned to death lying in his hammock colonel aureliano buendía was insensible to the pleas for clemency on the eve of the execution disobeying the order not to bother him úrsula visited him in his bedroom encased in black invested with a rare solemnity she stood during the three minutes of the interview “i know that you’re going to shoot ge rineldo” she said calmly “and that i can’t do anything to stop it but i give you one warning as soon as i see his bod y i swear to you by the bones of my father and mother by the memory of josé arcadio buendía i swear to you before god that i will drag you out from wherever you’re hi ding and kill y ou with my own two hands” before leaving the room without waiting for any reply she concluded “it’s the same as if you’d been born wi th the tail of a pig” during that interminable night while colonel gerineldo márquez thought about his dead afternoons in amaranta’ s sewing room colonel aureliano buendía scratched for many hours trying to break the hard shell of his solitude his onl y happy moments since that remote afternoon when his father had taken him to see ice had taken plac e in his silve r workshop where he pas sed the time putting little gold fishes together he had had to s tart thirtytwo wa rs and had had to v iolate all of his pacts with dea th an d wallow lik e a hog in the dungheap of glory in order to discover the privileges of simplicity almost forty years late at dawn wo rn out by the tormented vigil he a ppeared in the cell an hour before the execution “the farce is over old friend” he said to colone l gerineldo márquez “let’s get out of here before the mosquitoes in here execute you” colonel gerine ldo márquez could not repress the disdain that was inspired in him by th at attitud e “no aureliano” he replied “i’d rather be dead tha n see you ch anged into a bloody tyran t” “you won’t see me” colonel aureliano buendía said “put o n your shoes and help me get this shitty war ov er with” when he said it he did not know that it was easi er to start a war than to end one it took him almost a yea r of fierce and bloody ef fort to force the government to propose conditi ons of peace favorable to the rebels and another year to convince his own partisans of the convenience of accepting them he went to inconceivable extremes of cruelty t o put down the rebellion of his own officers who resisted an d called for victory and he finally relied on enem y forces to make the m submit he was n ever a greater s oldier than a t that time the certain ty that he wa s finally fighting for his own liberati on and not for abstract ideals for slog ans that politicians could twist left and right according to the circumstances filled him with an ardent enthusiasm colonel gerineldo márquez who fought for defeat with as much conviction an d loyalty as he had previously fought for victory reproached him for h is useless temerity “don’t wo rry” he would say smilin g “dying is much more difficult than one imagines” in his case it was tr ue the certainty that his da y was assign ed gave him a mysterious immunity an immortality or a fixed peri od that made him invulnerable to the risks of war and in the end perm itted him to win a defeat that was mu ch more difficult much more bloody and costly th an victory in almost twenty years of war colonel aureliano bue ndía had been at his house many times but the sta te of urgency wi th which h e always arri ved the mil itary retinue that acco mpanied him everywhere the aura of legend that glowed abou t his presence and of whic h even úrsula was aware changed him into a stran ger in the en d the last time tha t he was in maco ndo and too k a house fo r his three con cubines he was seen in his own hou se only on two or three o ccasions when he had th e time to accept an invitation to dine remedios the beauty and the twins born during the middle of the war scarcely knew hi m amaranta could not r econcile her image of the brother who had spent his adolescence making l ittle gold fi shes with that of the m ythical warrior who had placed a distance of ten feet between himself and the rest of huma nity but when th e approach of the armisti ce became kno wn and they thought tha t he would r eturn changed back into a human being delivered at last for t he hearts of his own pe ople the fa mily feelings dormant fo r such a long time were reborn stronger than ever “we’ll finally have a man in the house again” úrsula said amaranta was the first to suspect th at they had lost him forever one week before th e armistice when he entered the hou se without a n escort pre ceded by two barefoot orderlies who deposited on the porch the sad dle from the mule and the trun k of poetry all that was l eft of his former imperial baggage she saw him pass by the sewing room an d she called to him colonel aurel iano buendía had trouble recognizing her “it’s amaranta” she said goodhumoredly happy at his retu rn and she showed him the hand with the black bandage “look” colonel aureliano buendía smiled at her the same way as wh en he had first seen her with the bandage on that remote morning when he had co me back to macondo condemned to death “how awful” he said “the way time passes” the regular army had to protect the h ouse he arrive d amid ins ults spat up on accused of having accel erated the war in order to sell it for a better pr ice he was trembling with fever and cold and his armpits were studded with sores again six mont hs before when she had heard talk about the armistice úrsula had opened up and swept out th e bridal cha mber and ha d burned myrrh in the corners thinking that he would come back read y to grow old slowly among remedios’ musty dolls but actu ally during the la st two years he had paid his final dues to life inclu ding growing old when he passed by the silver shop which úrsula had pr epared wi th special di ligence he d id not even notice tha t the keys were in the lock he did not notice the mi nute tearing destruction that time had wreaked on the house and that after such a prolonged absence would have looked like a disaster to any man wh o had kept h is memories alive he wa s not pained by the p eeling of the whitewash o n the walls or the dirty cottony cob webs in the corn ers or the du st on the b egonias or the veins left on the beam s by the ter mites or the moss on the hinges or any of the insidious traps that nostalgi a offered him he sat down on the porch wrapped in his blanket and with his boots still on as if only waiting for it to clear and he spent the whole afternoon watching it rain on the begonias úrsula understood then that they would not have him home for long “if it’s not the war” she thought “it can only be death” it was a supposition that was so neat so convincing that she identified it as a premonition that night at dinner the supposed aureliano se gundo broke his bread with his right hand and drank his soup with his left his twin brother th e supposed josé arcadio segundo broke his brea d with his left hand and drank his soup with his right so precis e was their c oordination that they did not look like two brother s sitting opp osite ea ch other but like a trick with mirrors the spectacl e that the twins had invented when they became aware that they were equal was repeated in honor of the new arrival but colonel aureliano buendía did not not ice it he seem ed so alien to ev erything that he did not even notice r emedios the beauty as she passed by naked on her way to her bedroom úrsula was the only one who dared disturb his abstraction “if you have to go away again” she said halfwa y through dinner “at least try to rem ember how we were tonight” then colonel aureliano buendía realized witho ut surprise that úrsula was the onl y human being who had succeeded in penetrating his misery and for the first time in many year s he looked her in the face her skin was leathery her teeth de cayed her h air faded and colorless and her look frightened he compared her with the oldest memory that he had of her the afternoon when he had the premonition that a pot of boilin g soup was going to fall off the table and he found her broken to pieces in an instant he discovered the scratches the welts th e sores the ulcers and the scan tha t had been left on her by more than half a century of daily life and he saw that those damages did not even arouse a feeling of pity in him then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affection had r otted a way and he could not fi nd it on another occasi on he felt at least a confused sense of sham e when he found the sm ell of úrsula on his own skin and more than once he felt her thoughts interfering with his but al l of that had been wiped out by th e war even remedios his wife at th at momen t was a hazy image of someone who might have been his daugh ter the cou ntless wom en he had known on the d esert of love and who had spread his seed all along the co ast had left no trace in his feeli ngs most of them had come into his room in th e dark and h ad left before dawn and on the following day they were nothing but a tou ch of fatigue in his bodily memory th e only affection that pr evailed against time and the war was that which he had felt for his brother josé arcadio when they both were ch ildren a nd it was not based on love but on complicity “i’m sorry” he excused himself from úrsula’s reques t “it’s just that the wa r has done a way with everything” during the following days he busied himself destro ying all trace of his passage through the world he stripped the silver shop until all that were left were impersonal objects he gave his clothes away to the orderlies and he buried his weapons in th e courtyard with the s ame feeling of penance with which his father had buried the spear that had kille d prudencio aguilar he kept only one pistol with one bullet in it úrsula did not intervene the only time sh e dissuaded him was when he was ab out to destroy the daguerreotype of remedios that wa s kept in the parlor lighted by an eternal lamp “that pictur e stopped belonging to you a long ti me ago” she told him “i t’s a family r elic” on the eve of the ar mistice when no single object tha t would let him be remembered was left in the house he took the trunk of poetry to the ba kery when santa sofía d e la piedad wa s making ready to light the oven “light it with this” he told her handing her the first roll of yellowish papers “it will burn better because th ey’re very old things” santa sofía de la piedad the silen t one the cond escending o ne the one who never contradicted anyone not even her own children had the impression that it was a forbidden act “they’re important papers” she said “nothing of the sort” the colonel said “they’ re things that a person writes to himself” “in that case” she said “you burn them colonel” he not only did that but he broke up the trunk wi th a hatchet a nd threw the pieces into the fire hours before pilar ternera had come to visit hi m after so many years of not seeing her colonel aureliano buendía was startled at how old and fa t she had become and how much she had lost of the splendor of her laugh but he was also startled at the d epths she had reached in her reading of the cards “watch ou t for your mou th” she told him and h e wondered whether th e other time sh e had told him that during the height of his glory it had not been a surprisingly anticipated vision of his fate a s hort time later when his personal physi cian finished removing his sores he asked him without showing any particular interest where the exact location of his heart was the doctor listened with his stethos cope and then painted a ci rcle on his cheat wi th a p iece of cotto n dipped in iodine the tuesday of the armistice dawned warm an d rainy colonel aureliano buendía appeared in the kitchen before five o’clock and had his usual black coffe e without sugar “you ca me into the world on a day like this” úrsula told him “every body was a mazed a t your open eyes” he did not pay any attention becaus e he was listening to th e forming of the troops the sound of the comets and the voices of comma nd that were shattering th e dawn ev en though after so many years of war they should have sounded familiar to him this time he felt the same weakness in his knees and th e same tingling in his skin that he had felt in his youth in the presence of a naked woman he thought confusedly finally captive in a trap of nostalgia that perhaps if he had ma rried her he would have been a man without war and withou t glory a nameless artisan a happy ani mal that tar dy shudder which had n ot figured in his forethought made his breakfast bitter at s even in the mor ning when colonel gerineldo márquez cam e to fetch him in the comp any of a group of rebel officers he found him more taciturn than ever more pensiv e and solitary úrsula tried to throw a new wrap over his sho ulders “wh at will the government think” she t old him “t hey’ll figu re that you’ve surrendered because you didn’t have anything left to buy a cloak with” but he would not accept it when he was at the door he let her put an old felt hat of josé arcadio buendía’s on his head “aureliano” úrsula said to him then “promise me that if you find that it’s a bad hour for you there tha t you’ll think of your mother” he gave her a distant s mile raising his hand with all his fingers extended and withou t saying a word he left the house an d faced the s houts insul ts and blasph emies th at would follow him until he left the town úrsula put the bar on the door having decided not to take it down for the rest of her life “we’ll rot in here” she thought “we’ll turn to ashes in this house without men but we won’ t give this miserable town the pleasure of seeing us weep” she spent the wh ole morning looking for a memory of her son in the most hidden corners but she could find none the ceremo ny took place fifteen miles from macondo in the sh ade of a gigantic ceiba tree around which th e town of neerlandia would be founded later the d elegates from the governm ent and the party and th e com mission of the rebels who were laying down their arms were served by a nois y group of novices in white habits who looked like a flock of doves that ha d been frightened b y the rain colonel aureliano b uendía arrived on a mudd y mule he had not shav ed more tor mented by the pain of t he sores than by the grea t failure of his dreams for he had reac hed the end of all hope beyond glory and the nostalgia of glory in a ccord ance wi th his arrangements there wa s no music no fireworks no pealing bells no shouts of victory or any oth er manifestation that might alter th e mournful character of the armistice an itiner ant photographer who took the only picture of him that could ha ve been pres erved was forced to smas h his plates without developing them the ceremo ny lasted on ly the time necessary to sign the documents ar ound the rustic tab le placed in th e center of a patched circus tent wher e the d elegates sat were the last officers who were faithful to colonel aureliano buendía before ta king the signatures the personal delegate of the president of the republic tried to read the act of surrender aloud but colonel aureliano buendía was against it “let’s not waste time on formalities” he said and prepared to sign the papers without reading them one of his officers then broke the soporific silenc e of the tent “colonel” he said “please do us the favor of not being the first to sign” colonel aureliano buend ía acced ed when the do cuments went all around the table in the mids t of a silence that was so pure that one could have deciphered the signatures from the scratching of the pen on the paper the first line was still blank colonel aureliano buendía prepared to fill it “colonel” a nother of his officers said “there’s still time for everything to come out right” without changing his expression colonel aurelia no buendía signed the first copy he had not finished signing the last one when a rebel colonel appeared in the doorwa y leading a mule carrying two chests in spite of his entire youth he had a dry look and a patient expression he was the treasurer of the revolution in the macondo region he had made a difficult journey of six days pulling along the mule who was dying of hunger in or der to arrive at the ar mistice on time with an exasperating parsimony he took down the ches ts opened them and placed o n the table o ne by on e seventytwo gold bricks everyone ha d forgotten abou t the existence of that fortune in the disorder of the past year when th e central co mmand fell apart and th e revolution degenerated into a blood y rivalry of leaders it was impossible to determin e any respon sibility the gold of the revolution melted into blocks that were th en covered wi th baked clay was beyond all control colonel aureliano buendía had the seventy two gold bricks included in the inventory of surrender and closed the ceremony without allowing any speeche s the filthy adolescent stood opposite him looking into his eyes with his own cal m syrupcolored eyes “something else” colonel aureliano buendía asked him the young colonel tightened his mouth “the receipt” he said colonel aureliano buend ía wrote it out in his own hand then he had a gl ass of lemonade and a piece of biscuit that the novices wer e passing arou nd and retired to a field tent which had been prepared for him in case he wished to rest there he took off his shirt sat on the edge of the cot and at threefifteen in the afternoon took his pistol and shot himself in the iodine circle that hi s personal physician had painted on his chest at th at moment in macondo ú rsula took the cover off the pot of milk on the stove wondering why it wa s taking so long to boil and fo und it fu ll of worms “they’ve killed aureliano ” she exclaimed she looked toward the courtyard obeying a habit of her solitude and then she saw josé arcadio buendía soaking wet and sad in the ra in and much older than when he had died “they shot him in the back” úrsula said more precisely “and no one wa s charitable enough to close his eyes” at dusk through her tears she sa w the swift and luminous di sks that crossed the sky like an exhalation an d she thought that it was a signal of death she was still under the chestnut tree sobbing at her husband’s knees when they brought in colonel aureliano buendía wrapped in a blanket that was stiff with dry blood and with his eyes o pen in rage he was out of danger the bullet had followed such a nea t path that th e doctor was able to put a cord soaked in iodine in through the chest an d withdraw it from the back “that was m y masterpiece ” he said with satisfactio n “it wa s the only p oint where a bullet could pass through without har ming any vital organ” colonel aureliano buendía saw himself surrounded by chari table novices who intoned d esperate ps alms for the rep ose of his soul and then he was sorry that he had not shot himself in the roof of the mouth as he had considered doing if only to mock th e prediction of pilar tern era “if i still had the authority” he told the doctor “i’d have you shot out of hand not for having saved my life but for having made a fool of me” the failure of his death brought ba ck his lost prestige in a few hours the same people wh o invented the story th at he had sold the war for a room with walls made of gold bric ks defined the attemp t at suicide as an act of honor and proclaimed him a martyr then when he rejected th e order of merit awarded him by the president o f the republic even his most bitter enemies filed through the room asking him to withdraw recognit ion of the armistice and to start a new war the house was filled with gifts meant as amends impr essed finally by the massi ve support of his former comrades in arms colonel aureliano buendía did not put aside the possibility of pleasin g them o n the contrary at a certain moment he s eemed so en thusiastic with the idea of a new war that colonel gerineldo márquez thou ght that he was only wai ting for a pretext to pro claim it the pretext wa s offered in fa ct when the president of the republic refused to award any military pensions to former combatan ts liberal or conservative until each case was examined by a special commission and the award approved by the congress “that’s an outrage” thundered colonel aureliano buendía “they’ll die of old age waiting for the mail to come” for the first time he left the rocker that úrsula had bought for his convalescence and walking abou t the b edroom he dicta ted a strong message to the president of the republic in that telegram wh ich was never made public he denounced the first violation of the treaty of neerlan dia and threatened to proclaim war to the death if the assignmen t of pensions was not resolved within two weeks his attitude was so just that it allowed him to hop e even for the support of former conservative comb atants but the only reply from the government was the reinforcement of the military guard that had been placed at the door of his ho use with the pretext of pr otecting him and th e pro hibition of a ll types of vis its similar methods were adopted all through the country with other leader s who bore watching it was an oper ation that was so timely drastic and effective tha t two mon ths after the armistice when colonel aureliano buendía had recovered his most dedicated conspir ators were d ead or exiled or had been assimilated forever into public administration colonel aureliano buend ía left his room in december and it was sufficient for him to look at th e porch in order not to think about war again with a vitality that seemed impossible at her age úrsula had rejuvenated the hous e again “now they’re going to see wh o i am” she said when s he saw th at her son was going to live “there won’t be a better more o pen house in all the wo rld than this madhouse” she had it washed and painted chan ged the furniture restored the garden and planted new flowers and op ened doors and windows so th at the dazzling light of summer wou ld penetrate even into the bedrooms she decreed an end to the numerou s superimposed periods of mourning and she herself exchanged her rigorous old gowns fo r youthful clothing the music of the pianola again made the house merry when she heard it am aranta thought of pietr o crespi his evening gardenia and his smell of lavender and in the depths of her withered hea rt a clean rancor flourished purified by time one afternoon when she was trying to put the parlor in order úrsula asked for the help of the s oldiers who were guarding the house the young commander of the guard gave them permission little by little úrsula be gan assigning them new chores she invited them to eat gav e them clothing and shoes and taught them how to read and write when th e governmen t withdrew the guard one of them continued living in the house and was in her service for many years on new year’s day driven mad by rebuffs from remedi os the beauty the young commander o f the guard was found dead under her window chapter years later on his deathbed aureliano segundo would remember the rainy afternoon in june when he went into the b edroom to meet his first son even though the child was languid and weepy with no mar k of a buendía he did not have to think twice abou t naming him “we’ll call him josé arcadio” he said fernanda del carpio the beautiful woman he ha d married the year before agreed úrsula on the other hand could not conceal a vague feeling of do ubt throughout the long history of the family the insistent repetition of names had made her draw some co nclusions that seemed to be certain while the aurelianos were withdrawn but with l ucid minds the josé arcadios were i mpulsive and enterprising but they wer e marked with a tragic si gn the only cases th at were impossible to classify were those of josé arc adio segundo and aurelia no segundo they were so much alike and so mischievous during childhood that no t even santa sofía de la piedad coul d tell them apart on the day of their christening amaranta put bracelets on them with their respective names and dressed them in different colored clothing marked with each one’s i nitials but when they b egan to go to school they decided to exchange cl othing and bracelets and call each other by opposite names the teacher mel chor escalo na used to knowing josé ar cadio segundo by his green shirt went out of his mind wh en he discov ered that the latter wa s wearing aureliano segundo’s bracelet a nd that th e other one said nevertheless that his name was aureliano segundo in spite of the fact that he wa s wearing the white shirt and the bracelet with josé arcadio segundo’s name from then on he was never sure who was who even when they grew up and life made them different úrsula still wondered if they thems elves might not have made a mistake in some moment of their intricate gam e of confusion and had become chang ed forever until the beginning of adolescence they were two synchronized machines they would wake up at the same tim e have the urge to go to the bathroo m at the sam e time suffer the same ups ets in health and th ey even dreamed about th e same things in the house where it was thought that they coordin ated their actions with a simple desire to confuse no one realized what really was happening until one day when santa sofía de la piedad gave one of them a glass of lemonade and as soon as he tasted it the other one said that it needed sugar santa sofía de la piedad who had indeed forgotten to put sugar in the lemon ade told úrsula about it “that’s what they’re all li ke” she said without sur prise “crazy from birth” in time thi ngs became less disordered the one who came out of the game of conf usion with the name of aureliano segundo gre w to monumental size like his grandfathers and the one who kept the name of josé arcadio segundo grew to be bony like the colonel and the only thing they had in common was the family’s solitary air perhaps it was that crossing of stature names and ch aracter that made úrsula suspect that they had b een shuffled like a deck of cards since ch ildhood the decisive difference was revealed in the mids t of the war when josé arcadio segundo asked colonel gerineldo márquez to let him see an execut ion against úrsula’s better judgment his wishes were satisfied aureliano segundo on the other hand shuddered at the mere idea of witnessing an execution he preferred to stay home at the age of twelve he asked úrsula what was in the locked room “pape rs” she answered “melquíades’ books and the strange things that he wrote in his last years” instead of calming him the answer increase d his curiosity he demanded so much promised with such insistence tha t he would not mistreat the things that úrsula gave him the keys no one had gone into the room again since they had take n melquíades’ body out and had put on the door a padlock whose parts had become fused together with rust but when aureliano segundo opened the windows a familiar light entered that seemed accu stomed to lighting the room every day and ther e was not th e slightest trace of dust or cobwebs with everythin g swept and clean b etter swept and cleaner than on the day of the burial and the ink had not drie d up in the inkwell nor h ad oxidation diminished the shine of the metals no r had the em bers gone out under the water pipe where josé arcadio buendía had vaporized mercury on the shelves were the books bound in a cardboardlike material pale like tanned human skin and the manuscripts were intact in spite of the room’s having been shut up for many years the air seemed fresher tha n in the res t of the house everything was so recen t that several weeks later when úrsul a went into the room with a pail of water and a brush to was h the floor there was nothing for her to do aureliano segundo was deep in the reading of a book although it had no cover and the title d id not appea r anywhere the boy enjoyed the story of a woman who sat at a table and ate nothing but kernels of rice wh ich sh e picked up with a pin and the story of the fisherman who borrowed a wei ght for his net from a neighbor a nd when he gave him a fish in payment later it ha d a diamond in its stomach and the one about th e lamp tha t fulfilled wishes and abo ut flying carpets surprise d he asked úrsula if all that was tr ue and she answered hi m that i t was that man y years ago th e gypsies had brought magic lamps and flying mats to macondo “what’s hap pening” she sighed “is that th e world is slowly coming to an end and tho se things don’t come here any mo re” when he finished the book in which many of the stories had no endings because there were pages missing aureliano segundo se t about deci phering the manuscripts it was impossible the letters looked like clothes hung out to dry on a li ne and th ey looked more like musical notation th an writing one hot noonti me while he was poring over the manuscripts he sensed that he was no t alone in the room against the light from the window sitting with his hands on his knees was melquíades he was und er forty years of age he was wearing the same ol dfashioned vest and the hat th at look ed like a raven’s wings and across his pale temples there flowed the grease fr om his hai r that h ad been melted by the heat just as aureliano and josé arcadi o had seen him when they were children aureliano segundo recognized him at once becaus e that hered itary memory had been transmitted from generation to generation and had come to him through the memory of his grandfather “hello” aureliano segundo said “hello young man” said melquíades from then on for severa l years they saw each other almost every afternoon melquía des talked to him abou t the world tried to infuse him with his old wisdom but he refused to translate th e manuscripts “no one must know their meaning unt il he has reached one hundred years of age” he explained aureliano kept those meetings secret f orever on one occasion he felt that his private world had fallen apart because úrsula came in wh en melquíades was in the room but she did not see him “who were you talking to” she asked him “nobody” aureliano segundo said “that’s what your greatgrandfather did” úrsul a said “he used to talk to h imself too” josé arcadio segundo in the mean time had satis fied his wish to see a sho oting for the rest of his life he would remember the livid flash of the six sim ultaneous sh otsand the echo of th e discharge as it broke against the hills and the sa d smile and perplexed eyes of the man being shot who stood erect while his shirt became soaked with blood an d who was still smiling even when they untied him from the post and put him in a box f illed with quicklime “h e’s alive” h e thought “they’re going to bury him alive” it made such an impres sion on him that from then on he detested mili tary practices and war not because of the executions but because of the horrifying custom of burying the victims alive no one knew then exactly when he began to ring the bells in the church tower and as sist father antonio isa bel the successor to “the pup” at mass and take can of th e fighting cocks in the courtyard of the parish house when col onel gerinel do márquez found out he scolded him strongly for learning occupations repudiated by the liberals “the fact is” he answered “i think i’ve turned out to be a conservative” he believed it as if it had been determined by fate colonel gerineldo már quez scandalized told úrsula about it “it’s better that way” she approv ed “let’s hope that he becomes a priest so that god will finally come into th is house” it was soon discovered that father antonio is abel was preparing him for his first communion he was tea ching him the catechism as he shaved the necks of his roosters he explained to him wi th simple examples as he put the brood ing hens into their nests how it had occurred to god on the second day of creation that chickens would be fo rmed inside of an egg from that time on the parish priest began to show the signs of senility th at would lead him to say years later that the devi l had probably won his rebellion against god and that he was the one who sat on the heavenly throne with out revealing his true identity in order to trap the u nwary warmed up by the persistence of his mentor in a few m onths josé arcadio segund o came to be as adept in theological tricks used to confuse the devil as he was skilled in the tricks of the cock pit amaranta made him a linen suit with a collar and tie bought him a pair of white s hoes and engraved his name in gilt letters on the ribbon of the candle two nights before the fi rst communion father antonio is abel closeted himself with him in the sacristy to h ear his confe ssion with the help of a dictionary of sins it was such a long list that th e aged priest used to going to bed at six o’clock fell asleep in his chair before it was over the interrogation was a revelation for josé arcad io segundo it did not su rprise him that the priest asked him if he had do ne bad things with wo men and he h onestly ans wered no but he was upset with the question as to whether he had done them with animals the first friday in may he received communion tortured by curiosi ty later on he asked petronio the sickly sexton who lived in the belfry and who according to what they said fed himself on bats about it and petronio answered him “there are some corrupt christians who do their business with female donkeys” josé arcadio segundo still showed so mu ch curiosity and asked so many questions tha t petronio lost his patience “i go tuesd ay nights” he confessed “if you promise not to tell an yone i’ll take you next tuesday” indeed on the following tuesday petronio came down out of the tower with a wood en stool which until then no one had known the use of an d he took josé arcadio segundo to a nearby pasture the boy became so taken with those nocturn al raids that it was a long time bef ore he was seen at cata rino’s he became a cockfight man “take those creatures s omewhere el se” úrsula ordered him the first tim e she sa w him come in with his fine fighting birds “roosters have alread y brought too much bitter ness to this house for you to bring us any more” josé arcadio segundo took them a way without any argument but he continued breeding them at the house of pilar ternera his grandmother who gave him everything he needed in exchange for having him in her house he soon displayed in the cockpit the wisdom that father antonio isabel had given him and he made enough money not only to enrich his br ood but also to look for a man’s satisfactions úrsula compared him with his brother at that ti me and could not understa nd how the twins who looked like t he same person in childhood had ended up so differently her perplexity did not last very long for quite soon aureliano segundo began to show signs of laziness and dissipation while he was shut up in melquíades’ room he was dr awn into himself the way colonel aureliano buendía had been in his youth but a short ti me after th e treaty of n eerlandia a piece of cha nce took hi m out of his withdrawn self and made him face the reality of the world a young woman who wa s selling numbers for the raffle of an accordion greeted him wi th a great deal of familiarity aureliano segundo was not surprise d for he was frequently c onfused with his brother but he did not clear up the mistake not even wh en the girl tried to soften his heart with sobs and she ended ta king him to her room she liked him so much from that first meeting tha t she fixed things so that h e would wi n the accordio n in the raffle at the end of two weeks aureliano segundo realized that the woman had been going to bed altern ately with hi m and his brot her thinking that they were th e same man and instead of making things clear he arranged to prolong t he situation he did not return to melquíades’ room he would spend his afternoons in the courtyard learning to play the accordion by ear over the protests o f úrsula who at th at time had forbidden music in the house b ecause of th e mourning a nd who in addition despised the a ccordion as an instrument worthy only of the vagabond heirs of francisco the man neverthele ss aureliano segundo be came a virtuoso on the accordion and he still was after he had married and had children and was one of the most respected men in macondo for almost two months he shared th e woman with his brother he would watch him mix up his plans and when he wa s sure that josé arcadi o segundo was not going to visit their common mistress tha t night he would go and sleep with her one morning he found that he wa s sick two days later he found his brother clinging to a beam in the bathroom soaked in sweat and with tea rs pouring dow n and then he understood his brothe r confessed to him that the woman had sent him away because he had given her what she called a lowlife s ickness he also told him how pilar ternera had tried to cu re him aureliano segund o submitted secretly to the burning baths of permanganate and to diuretic waters and both were cured separately after th ree month s of secret suffering josé arcadio segundo did not see th e woman again aureliano segundo obtained her pardon and stayed wi th her until his death her name was petra cotes she had arrived in ma condo in the middle of the war with a chalice husband who lived off raffles and when the man died she kept up the business she was a clean young mulatto woman with yellow almondshaped eyes that gave her face the ferocity of a panther but she had a generous heart and a magnificent vo cation for love when úrsula realized that josé arcadio segundo was a cockfight man and th at au reliano segundo played the accordion at his concubine’s noisy parties she thought she would go mad with the combination it was as if the defects of th e family and none of the virtues had b een con centr ated in both then she d ecided tha t no one again would be called aureliano or josé ar cadio yet when aureliano segundo had his first son she did not dare go against his will “all right” úrsula said “but on one condition i will bring him up” although she was already a hundred years old and on the point of going b lind from cataracts she still had her physical dynamism her i ntegrity of ch aracter and her mental balance intact no one would be better able tha n she to sha pe the virt uous man wh o would restore the pres tige of the family a man who would never have heard talk of war fighting cocks bad women or wild undertakings four calamities that according to what úrsula thought had determined the downfall of their line “this one will be a priest” she pro mised solemnly “and if god gives m e life he’ll be pope somed ay” they all laughed wh en they heard he r not only in the bedroom but al l through the house where aureliano segundo’s rowdy friends were gathered the war relegated to the attic o f bad memories was momentarily recalled wi th the popping of champagne bottles “to the heal th of the pope” aureliano segundo toasted the guests toasted in a chorus then the man of the house pla yed th e acco rdion fireworks wer e set off and drums celebrated the event throughout the to wn at dawn the guests soaked in champagne sacrificed six cows and put them in th e street at the disposal of the crowd no one was scandalized since aureliano segundo had taken ch arge of the house those festivities were a common thi ng even when there was no motive as proper as the birth of a pope in a few years without effort simply by luck he had accumulated one of the largest fortunes in the swamp thank s to the supernatural proliferation of his animals hi s mares would bear triplets his hens laid twice a day and his hogs fattened with such speed that no one could explain such disorderly fecundity except throu gh the use of black magic “save so mething now” úrsula would tell her wild great grandson “this luck is not going to last all yo ur life” but a ureliano segundo paid no attention to her the more he opened champagne to soak his frie nds the more wildly his animals ga ve birth and the more he was convinced that his lucky star was not a matter of his conduct but an influence of petra cotes his concubine whose love had the virtue of exasperating nature so convinced was h e that this was the origin of his fortune that he never kept petra cotes far away from his breeding grounds and even when he married a nd had child ren he conti nued living with her with the cons ent of fernanda solid mon umental like his grandfathers but with a joie de vivre and an irresistible good humor that they di d not hav e aureliano segund o scarcely had time to l ook after his animals all he had to do was to ta ke petra cores to his br eeding grounds and have her ride across his land in order to ha ve every an imal marked with his brand succu mb to th e irremediable plague of proliferation like all the good things that occurred in his long life that tremendous fortune had its origins in chance until the end of the wars petra cotes cont inued to support herself w ith the returns from her raffles and aureliano segundo was a ble to sack úrsula’s savings from time to time they were a frivolous couple with no other wor ries except going to bed every night even on forbidden days and frolicking there until dawn “that woman has been your ruination” úrsula would shout at her greatgrandson when sh e saw him coming into the house li ke a sleepwalker “she’s got you so bewitched that one of these days i’m going to see you twisting around with colic and with a toad in your belly” josé arcadio segundo who took a long time to d iscover that he had been supplanted was unable to understand his brother’s passion he rememb ered petra cotes as an ordin ary woman rather lazy in bed and co mpletely la cking in any resources for lovemaking deaf to úrs ula’s clamor and the teasi ng of his brother aureliano segundo onl y thought at that tim e of finding a trade tha t would allow him to m aintain a house for petra cotes and to die with her o n top of h er and under neath her during a night of feverish licen se when colonel aureliano buendía opened up his workshop again seduced at last by the peaceful charms of old age aureliano segundo t hought that it would be good business to devote himself to the manufactu re of little gold fishes he spent many hours in the hot room watching ho w the hard sheets of metal worked by the colo nel with the inconceivable patience of disillusionment were slowly being converted into golden scales the work seemed so la borious to him and th e thought of petr a cotes was so persisten t and pressin g that after three weeks he disappeared from the workshop it wa s during that time that it occurr ed to petra cotes to raffle off rabbits they reproduced and grew up so fast that there was barely time to sell the tickets for the raffle at first aureliano segundo did not n otice th e alarming proportions of the proliferation but one night when nobody in town wanted to hear about the rabbit raffle any more he heard a noise by the courtyard door “don’t get worried” petra cotes said “it’s only the rabbits” they could not sleep tormented by the u proar of the animals at dawn aureliano segundo opened the door and sa w the courtyard paved wi th rabbits bl ue in th e glow of dawn petra cotes dying with laughter could not resist th e temptation of teasing him “those are the ones who were born last night” she aid “oh my god” he said “why don’t you raffle off cows” a few days l ater in an attempt to clea n out her courtyard petra cotes exch anged the ra bbits for a cow who two months later gave birth to triplets that was ho w things began overnight aureliano segundo be came the owner of land and livestock and he barel y had time to enlarge his overflowing barns and pigpens it was a delirious prosperity that even mad e him laugh and he coul d not help doing crazy things to release his good humor “cea se cows l ife is short” he would s hout úrsula wondered what entanglements he h ad got into whether he might be stealing whether he had become a ru stler and every time she s aw him unco rking champagne just for the pleasure of pouring the foam over his head she would shout at him and scold him for the waste it anno yed him so much that o ne day wh en he awoke in a merry mo od aureliano segundo appeared with a chest full of money a can of paste and a brush and singing at the top of his lungs the old songs of francisco the man he papered the house inside and out an d from top to bottom with onepeso banknotes the old ma nsion painted white since the tim e they had brought the pianola took on the strang e look of a mosque in the midst of the excitement of the family the scandalization of úrsula the joy of the peopl e cramming the street to watch th at apotheosis of squandering aurelia no segundo finished by papering the house from the front to the kitchen including bathrooms and bedrooms and threw th e leftover bills into the co urtyard “now” he said in a final way “i hope that nobod y in this hou se ever talks to me about money again” that was what happened úrsula had the bills take n down stuck to great cak es of whitewash and the house was painted white again “ dear lord” she begged “make us po or again the way we were when we founded this town so that you will not collect for this squandering in the other life” he r prayers wer e answered in reverse one of the workmen removing the bills bumped into an enormous plaster statue of saint jose ph that someone had left in the house during the last years of the war and the hollow figure broke to pieces on the floor it h ad been stuffed with gol d coins no one could remember who had brought that lifesi zed saint “three men brought it” amaranta explained “they asked us to keep it until the rai ns were over and i told them to put it there in th e corner wher e nobody would bump into it and there th ey pu t it very car efully and there it’s been ever since because th ey never came back for it” later on úrsula had put candles on it and had prostrated h erself before it not sus pecting that instead of a saint she was adoring almost fou r bundled pounds of gold the tardy evidence of he r involuntary paganism made her even more upset she spat on the spectacular pile of coins put them in three canvas sacks and buried them in a secret place hoping that sooner or later the thr ee unknown men would come to reclaim them much later during the difficult years of her decrepitud e úrsula would intervene i n the conver sations of the many tra velers who came by th e house at tha t time and as k them if they had left a plaster saint joseph there during the war to be taken care of until the rains passed things like that which gave úrsula such c onsternation were commonplace in those days macondo was swamp ed in a miracu lous prosperity the ado be houses o f the founders had been replaced by brick buildings with wooden blinds and cemen t floors which made the suf focating heat of two o’clock in the afternoon more bearable all that remained at that time of josé arcadio buendía’s ancient village were the dusty almond tr ees destined to resist the most arduous of circumstances and the ri ver of clear water whos e prehistoric stones had been pulverized by th e frantic hammers of josé arcadio segundo when he set about opening the channel in order to establish a boat line it was a mad dream compara ble to thos e of hi s greatgrandfather for the rocky riverbed and the numero us rapids prevented naviga tion from macondo to the sea but josé arcadio segundo in an unforeseen burst of temerity stub bornly kept on with the pr oject unti l then h e had shown no sign of imagination except for his pre carious adventure with petra cotes he had never known a woman úrsula had considered him the qui etest exam ple the family had ever produced i n all its history incapable of standing out even as a handler of fighting cocks when colonel aureliano buendía told him the story of the spanish galleon aground eight miles from the sea the carbonized frame of which he had seen himself during the war the story which for so many years had seemed fantastic to so many people was a revelation for josé arcadio segundo he auctioned off his roosters to the highest b idder recruited men bo ught tools and set abou t the aweso me task o f breaking stones digging canals clearing away rapi ds and even harnessing wa terfalls “i know all of this by heart” úrsula would shout “it’s as if time had turned around and we were back at the beginning” when he thought that the river was n avigable josé ar cadio segundo gave his brother a detailed acco unt of his plans and the latter gave him the mon ey he need ed for the enterprise he disappeared for a long time it had b een said that his plan to buy a boat was nothing but a trick to make off with his brother’s money when the news spread that a strange craft was approaching the town the inhabitants of macondo who no longer remember ed the colos sal undertakings of josé arcadio buendía ran to the riverbank and saw with eyes poppi ng in disbelief the arrival of the first and last boat ever to dock in the town it was not hing but a log raft drawn by thick ropes pulled by twenty men who walked along the ba nk in the p row with a glow of satisfaction in his eyes jos é arcadio segundo was directing the arduous maneuv er there arrived with him a rich group of splendid matrons who were protecting themselves from the burning sun with gaudy parasols and wore on their shoulders fine silk kerchiefs with colored creams on their faces and natu ral flowers in their hair and golden serpents on their arms an d diamonds in their teeth the log raft was the only vessel that j osé arcadio segundo was able to b ring to macondo and only once b ut he never recognized the failure of his enterprise but proclaim ed his deed as a victory of will power he gave a scrupulous accounting to his brother and very soon plunged ba ck into the routine of cockfights the only thing th at remain ed of that unfor tunate vent ure was the b reath of ren ovation tha t the m atrons from france brought as their magnificent arts tr ansformed traditional methods of love and their sense of social wellbeing abolished catarino’s antiqua ted place a nd turned th e street into a bazaar of japanese lanterns and nostalgic hand organs th ey were the pr omoters of the bloody ca rnival that plunged macondo into delirium for three days and whose only l asting consequence was having given aureliano segundo the opportunity to meet fern anda del car pio remedios th e beauty was proclaimed queen úrsula who shuddered at the disquieted beauty of her greatgranddaughter could not prevent the ch oice until then she had succeeded in keeping her off the streets unless it was to go to mass with amaranta b ut she mad e her cover h er face with a black shawl the most impious men those who would disguise themselves as priests to say sacrilegious masses in catarino’s store would go to ch urch with an aim to see if only fo r an instan t the face of remedios the beauty whose legen dary good looks were s poken of with alarming excitemen t throughout the swamp it was a long ti me before they were ab le to do so and it would have been better for th em if they never had beca use most of them never recovered th eir peacefu l habits of sl eep the man who made it possible a foreigner lost his serenity forever became involved in the sloughs o f abjection a nd misery a nd years later was cu t to pi eces b y a train after he had fallen asleep on th e tracks from the momen t he was seen in the church wearing a green velvet suit and an embroidered vest no one doubted that he came from far a way perhaps from some distant city o utside of the country attr acted by th e magical fascination of remedios the beauty h e was so handsome so elegant and dignified with su ch presence that pietro crespi would have been a mere fop beside him and many women whisper ed with spiteful smiles that he was the one wh o really should have worn the shawl he did not sp eak to anyone in macond o he appeared at dawn on sunday li ke a prince i n a fairy tale riding a horse with silver stirrups and a velvet bla nket and h e left town after mass the power o f his presence was such that from the first time he was seen in the church everybody took it for granted tha t a silent and tense duel had been estab lished between him and remedios the beauty a secret pact an irrevocable challenge that would end not only in l ove but also in death on the sixth sunday the gentleman appear ed with a ye llow rose in his hand he heard mass standing as he alwa ys di d and at th e end h e stepped in front of remedios the beauty and offered her the solitary rose she took i t with a natur al gesture as if she had been prepar ed for that homage and then she uncovered her face and gave her thanks wi th a smile that was all she did not only for the gentleman but for all the men who had the unfortunate privilege of s eeing her that wa s an eterna l instant from then on the gentleman had a band of musici ans play beside the window of remedios the beauty som etimes until dawn aureliano segundo was the onl y one who felt a cordial compassion for him and he tried to b reak his perseverance “d on’t waste your time any more” he told him one night “the women in th is house are worse than mules” he offered him his friendship invited him to bathe in champagne tried to mak e him under stand that the females of his family had insides made of flint but he could not weaken his obsti nacy exasp erated by th e interminab le nights of music colonel aureliano buendía threatened to cure his afflic tion with a f ew pistol shots nothing made him d esist except his own lamentable s tate of demoralization from a welldressed and neat individual he became filthy and ragged it was ru mored that he had abandoned power and fortune in his distant nation althou gh his origins were actu ally never known he became argumentative a barroom brawler and he would wake up rolling in hi s own filth in catarino’s store the saddest part of his drama was that remedios the beauty did not notice hi m not ev en when he app eared in chur ch dressed like a prince she accepted th e yellow rose wi thout the least bit of malice amused rather by the extravaga nce of the act and she lifted her sh awl to see his face better not to show hers actually remedios the beauty was not a creatu re of this world until she was well along in puberty santa sofía de la piedad had to bathe and dress her and even when she could take care o f herself it was necessary to keep an eye on her so that she woul d not paint little animals on the walls with a stick daubed in her own excrement she reached twenty without knowing how to read or write unable to use the s ilver at the table wander ing naked th rough the h ouse becaus e her na ture rejected all manner of convention when the yo ung commander of the guard declared his love for her she rejected him si mply becaus e his frivolity startled h er “see how simple he i s” she told amaranta “he says that he’s dying because of me as if i were a bad case of colic” when indeed they found him dead besi de her window remedios the beauty confirmed her first impression “you see” she commen ted “he was a complete simpleton” it seemed as if some penetrating lucidity permit ted her to s ee the reality of things beyond any formalism that at least was the point of vi ew of colonel aureliano buendía for whom remedios the beauty was in no way mentally retarded as was generally believed but quite the opposi te “it’s as if she’s come back from twenty years of war” he would say úrsula for her part thanked god for having awarded the fam ily with a cr eature of exceptional pu rity but a t the sam e time she wa s disturbed by her beauty for it seemed a contradictory virtue to her a diabolical trap at the center of her innocence it was for that reason that she decide d to keep her away from the world to protect her from all earthly temptation not knowing that remedios th e beauty ev en from the time wh en she was in her mother’s womb was safe from any contagion it never entered her head that they would elect her beauty q ueen of the carnival pand emonium but aureliano segundo excited at th e caprice of di sguising him self as a tig er brought father anto nio isabel to the h ouse in order to convince úrsula that the carnival was not a pagan feas t as she said but a catholic tradition finally convinced even though reluctantly sh e consented to the coron ation the news th at remedios buendía was going to be the sovereign ruler of the festival went beyond the limits of the swamp i n a few hour s reached di stant pla ces where th e prestige of her beauty was not known and it aroused the anxi ety of those who still thought of her last name as a symbol of subversion the anxiety was baseless if anyone had become h armless at that time it was the aging and disillusioned colonel aureliano buendía who was sl owly losing all contact with the reality of the nation enclosed in his workshop his only relationship with the rest of the world was hi s business in little gold fishes one of the soldiers who had guarded his house during the first days of peace would go sell them in the villages of the sw amp and retur n loaded down with coins and news that the co nservative government he would say with the backing of the liberals was reforming the calend ar so that ev ery president co uld remain in power for a hundred years that the concordat with the ho ly see had finally been si gned and a cardinal had come from rome with a crown o f diamonds and a throne of solid gold and that th e liberal ministers had had their pictures taken o n their knees i n the act of kissing his ring that th e leading lady of a spanis h company pas sing through the ca pital h ad been kidnapped by a b and of mask ed highwaymen and o n the following sunday she had danced in the nude at the summ er house of the president of the republic “don’t talk to me about politics” the colonel would tell him “our b usiness is selling little fis hes” the rumor that he did not want to hear anything about the situation in the countr y because h e was growin g rich in his workshop made úrsula laugh when i t reached her ears with her terrible practical sense she could not understa nd the colon el’s business as he exchan ged little fishes for gold coins and then converted the coins into little fishes and so on with the resu lt that h e had to work all the harder with the mor e he sold in order to satisfy an exasperating vicio us circle actual ly what interested him was not th e business but the work he need ed so much con centration to link scales fit minute rubies into the eyes laminate gills and p ut on fins th at there was not the smallest empty moment left for him to fill with his disillusionment of the war so absorbin g was the attention required by the delicacy of his artistry that in a short ti me he h ad aged more th an during all the years of the war and his position had twisted his spine and the close work had used up his eyesight but the implacabl e concentra tion awarded him with a peace of the spirit the last time he was s een to take a n interest in some matter related to th e war was when a group of veteran s from both parties sought his support for the approval of lifetime pensi ons which had always been promised and were always about to be put into effect “forget about it” he told them “you can s ee how i refuse my pension in order to get rid of the torture o f waiting for it until the d ay i died” at first colonel gerineldo márquez would visit him at dusk and they would both sit in the street do or and talk a bout the p ast but amara nta could no t bear the m emories that that man wh ose baldness had plunged him into the abyss of pr emature old age aroused in her and she would torment him with snide remarks until he did n ot come back except on s pecial occasions and he finally disappeared extinguished by paralysis taciturn silent insensible to the new brea th of vitality that was shaking the house colonel aureliano buendía could understand only that the secret of a good old a ge is simply an honorable pact with solitude he would get u p at five in the morning after a light sleep have his eternal mug of bitter coffee in the kitchen shut himself up all day in the workshop an d at four in the afternoon he would g o along the porch dragging a stool n ot even no ticing the fire of the rose bu shes or the brightness of the hour or the persisten ce of amaranta whose melancholy made the noi se of a boiling pot which was perfectly percepti ble at dusk and he would sit in the street door as long as the mos quitoes would allow him to someone dared to disturb his solitude once “how are you colonel” he asked in passing “right here” he answered “waiting for my funeral procession to pass” so that the a nxiety caus ed by the pub lic reappear ance of his fa mily name having to do with th e coronation o f remedios the beauty was baseless many people did not think that way however innocent of the tragedy that threatened it the town poured into the main square in a noisy explosion of merriment the carnival had reac hed its highest level of madness and aureliano segundo had satisfied at last his drea m of dressin g up like a tiger and was walking along the wild throng hoarse from so much roaring when on the swamp road a parade of several pe ople appeared carrying in a gilded litter the most fascinatin g woman that imaginatio n could con ceive for a moment th e inhabitants of macond o took off thei r masks in order to get a better look at the dazzling creature with a crown of emeralds an d an ermine cape wh o seemed invested with legitimate au thority and was not mer ely a sovere ign of bangles and crepe paper there were man y people who had sufficient insight to suspect that it was a qu estion of provocation but aureliano segundo immediately conquered his perplexity and d eclared the new arrivals to be guests of honor and with th e wisdom of solomon he seated r emedios the beauty and the intruding queen on th e same dais u ntil midnight the stranger s disguised as bedouins took part in the delirium and even enriched it with sumptuous fireworks and acrobatic skills th at made one think of the art of the gypsies suddenly during the paroxys m of the celebration someone broke the delicate b alance “long live the liberal party” he shou ted “long live colonel aureliano buendía” the rifle shots drowned o ut the spl endor of the fireworks and th e cries of ter ror drowned out th e music and joy turned into panic many years later there were those who still insisted that the royal guard of the intruding queen was a squad of regu lar army soldiers who wer e concealing government issue rifles under their rich moorish robes th e government denied the charge in a special proclamatio n and promised a complete investigation of the bloody episode but the truth never came to light and the ver sion always p revailed that the royal guard without provocation of any kind took up combat positions upon a signal from their commander and opened fire without pity on the crowd when calm was restored not one of the false bedouins remained in town and there were many dead and wounded lying on the square nine clowns four columbines seventeen playingcard kings one devil three minstrels two peers of fr ance and three japanese empresses in the confu sion of the panic josé arcadio segundo managed to rescue remedios the beauty and aureliano segundo carried the intr uding queen to the hous e in his arms her dress torn and the ermine cap e stained with blood her name was fernanda del carp io she had been chos en as the mo st beautiful of the five thousand most beau tiful women in th e land and they had brought her to macondo wi th the promise of naming her queen of madagascar úrsula took care of her as if she were her own daughter the town ins tead of dou bting her inno cence piti ed her cand or six months after the massacre when the wou nded had recovered and the last flowers on the mass grave had withered aureliano segundo went to fetch her from the distan t city wh ere she lived with her father and he married her in macondo with a noisy celebration that lasted twenty days chapter the marriage was on the poin t of breaking up after two months becaus e aureliano segundo in an attemp t to placate petra cotes had a picture ta ken of her dressed as the queen of madagascar when fernanda found out about it s he repacked her bridal trunks and left macondo without saying goodbye aureliano segundo caught up with he r on the swamp road after much pleading and promises of reform he succeeded in g etting her to come home and he aban doned his co ncubine petra cotes aware of her strength showed no sign s of worry she had made a man of him while he was still a child she had drawn him out of melq uíades’ room his head full of fantastic ideas and lacking any contact with r eality and she had given him a place in the world nature had made him reserved and withdrawn with tendencies toward solitary meditation and she had molded a n opposite character in him one that was vital expa nsive open and she had injected him with a jo y for living and a pleasure in spending and celebratin g until she had converted him inside and out into the m an she had drea med of for herself ever since adoles cence then h e married as a ll sons marry sooner or lat er he did n ot dare tell her the news he assum ed an attitude that was quite childis h under the circumstances feigning anger and imagin ary resentm ent so that petra cotes would be the one who would bring about the break one day when aureliano segundo reproached her unjustly she eluded the trap and put things in their proper place “what it all means” she said “is that you want to marry the qu een” aureliano segundo ashamed preten ded an attack of rage said that he was misunderstood an d abused and did not visit her again pe tra cotes wi thout losing her poise of a wild beast in repose for a single instant hear d the music and the fir eworks from the wedding the wild bu stle of the celebration a s if all of it were nothin g but some new piece o f mischief on the part of aureliano segundo those who p itied her fate were calm ed with a smile “don’t worry” she told them “queens run errands for me” to a neighbor woman who brought her a set of candles so that she could light up the picture of her lost lover wi th them she said with an enigmatic security “the only ca ndle that will make him come is always lighted” just as she had foreseen aureliano segundo went back to her house as soon as the honeymoon was over he brought his usual old friends a trav eling photographer and the gown and ermine cape soiled with blood that f ernanda had worn during the carnival in the heat of the m erriment that broke out that evening he had petra cotes dre ss up as queen crowned her absolute and lifetime ruler of madagascar and handed out copies of th e picture to his friends she not only went along with the game but she felt sorry for him inside thin king that he must have been very frightened to have conceived of that ex travagant means of reconc iliation at seven in the evening still dressed as the queen s he received him in bed he had been married sca rcely two m onths but s he realized a t once that th ings were not going well in the nuptial bed and she had the delicious pleasure of vengeance fulfilled two days later however when he did not dare return but sent an intermediary to arrange the terms of the separatio n she unders tood that s he was going to need more patience than she had foreseen because he seemed ready to sacrifice hi mself for the sake of app earances no r did she get upset that tim e once agai n she made things easy with a submission that co nfirmed the generalized belief that s he was a po or devil and the only souvenir she kept of aureli ano segund o was a pair of patent leather boots which according to what he himself had said were t he ones he wanted to wear in his co ffin she kept them wr apped in cloth in the botto m of a trunk and m ade ready to feed on memories waiting without despair “he has to come sooner or later” she told hersel f “even if it’s just to put on those boots ” she did not have to wait as long as she had imagined actuall y aureliano segundo understood from the night of his wedding that he would retu rn to the house of petr a cotes much sooner than when he would have to put on the patent leather boots fernanda was a woman who was lost in the world she had been bo rn and raised in a city s ix hundred miles away a gloomy city where o n ghostly nights the coaches of the vi ceroys still rattled through the cobb led streets thirtytwo belfries tolled a dirge at six in the afternoon in the manor house which was paved with tomblike slabs the sun was never seen the air had died in the cypr esses in the courtyard in the pal e trappings of the bedrooms in th e dripping archways of the gard en of perennials until puberty fernanda had no news of the world except fo r the melancholy piano lessons taken in some neighboring house by someone who fo r years and years had the drive not to take a si esta in the room of her sick mother green and yellow unde r the powder y light from the windowpanes she would listen to the methodical stubborn heartless sc ales and think that that music was in the world while she was being co nsumed as she wove funera l wreath s her moth er perspiring with five o’clock fever spoke to her of the splendor of the past when she was a little girl on one moonli t night fernanda saw a bea utiful wo man dressed in white crossing th e garden toward th e chapel what bothered her most about that fleeting vision was that she felt i t was exactly like her as if she ha d seen herself twenty years in advance “it was your greatgrandmother the queen” her mother told her during a truce in her coughing “she died of some bad vap ors while she was cuttin g a string of bulbs” many years later when she began to f eel she was the equal of her greatgrandmother fernanda doubted her childhood vision but her mother scolded her disbelief “we are immensely rich and powerful” she told her “one day you will be a queen” she believed it even though they were sitting at th e long table with a linen tablecloth a nd silver service to h ave a cup o f watered ch ocolate and a sweet bun until the day of her wedding she dreamed ab out a legend ary kingdom in spite of the fa ct tha t her fath er don ferna ndo had to mortgage the house in order to buy her trousseau it was not innocence or delusions of grandeur that was how they had brought her up since she had had the use of reason she remembered having done her duty in a gold pot with the f amily crest o n it she left the house for the first time at th e age of twelve in a coa ch and horses that had to travel only two bl ocks to take her to the convent her classmates were surprised that she sat apart from th em in a chair with a very high back and that she would not even mingle with them during recess “she’s different” the nuns would e xplain “she’s going to be a queen” her schoolmates believed this because she was alr eady the most beautiful distinguished and discreet girl they had ever seen at the end of eight years after having learned to write latin poetry play the clav ichord talk about falconry with gentlemen and ap ologetics with archbishops discuss affairs of state with foreign rulers and affairs of g od with the pope she returned to her parents’ home to weave funeral wreath s she found it despoiled all tha t was left wa s the furniture that was ab solutely necessary the silver candelab ra and table service for the everyda y utensils had been sold one by one to underwrite the costs of her educati on her mother had suc cumbed to fiveo’clock fever her father don fe rnando dressed in black with a stiff collar and a gold watch chain would give her a silver co in on mondays for the household expenses and the funeral wreaths finished the week before would be ta ken away he spent mo st of his time shut up in his study an d the few ti mes tha t he went ou t he woul d return to recite th e rosary with her she had intimate friendships with no one she had never heard mentio n of the wars that were bleeding the country she continued her piano less ons at three in the afternoon she had even began to lose the illusion of being a queen when two peremptory raps of the knocker sounded at the door and sh e opened it to a wellgroomed military officer with ceremonious manners who had a scar on his cheek and a gold m edal on his chest he clos eted himself with her fath er in the stu dy two hou rs later her father came to get her in the sewing room “get your things together” he told her “you have to take a long trip” that was how th ey took her to ma condo in one single day with a brutal slap lif e threw on top of her the whole weight of a realit y that her parents had k ept hidden f rom her for many years when she returned home she shut herself up in her room to weep indifferent to don fernando’s pleas and ex planations as he tried to erase the scar s of that stra nge joke she had sworn to herself never to leave her bedroom until she di ed when aureliano segundo came to get her it was an act o f impossible fate becaus e in the confu sion of her i ndignation in the fury of her shame she had lied to him so that he would never know he r real identity the onl y real clues that aurelian o segundo had when he left to look for her were her unmistakable highland accent and h er trade as a weaver of funeral wreath s he search ed for her without ceas e with the fierce temerity with which josé arcadi o buendía h ad crossed the mountain s to found macondo with the blind pride with which colonel aureliano buendía had undertaken his fruitless wars with the mad tenacity with which úrsula watched over the survival of the line aureliano segundo looked for fernanda withou t a single moment of respite when he asked wher e they sold funeral wreaths they took him from house to house so that he could choose the best ones when he asked for t he most beautiful woman who had ever been seen on this earth all the wom en brought h im their dau ghters he b ecame lost in misty byways in times reserved for oblivion in labyrinths of disappointment he cros sed a yellow plain where the echo rep eated one’s thoughts an d where anxiety brought on premonitory mirages after sterile weeks he came to an unknown city wh ere all the bells were tolling a dirge although he had never s een them and no one had ever des cribed them to him he im mediately recognized th e walls eaten away by bone salt the bro kendown w ooden balco nies gutted by fungus and nailed to the outside door almost erased by ra in the saddest cardboard sign in the world funeral wreath s for sale from that moment until the icy morning when fernanda left her hou se under the care of the mother superior there was barely enough time for the nuns to sew her trousseau and i n six trunks put the cand elabra the silver service and the gold chamber pot along with the countless and useless remains of a family catastrophe that had been two centuries l ate in its fulfillment don fernando declined the invitation to go along he promised to go later when he had cleared up his affairs and from the moment when he gave his daughter his bl essing he shut himself up in his st udy again to write out the announcements with mournful sketches and the family coat of arms whi ch would b e the first human contact that fernanda and her father would have had in all their lives that was the real date of h er birth fo r her for aurel iano segu ndo it was almost simultaneously the beginning and the end of happiness fernanda ca rried a delicate calendar with small golden keys o n which her spiritual adviser had marked in purple ink the dates of venereal abst inence not co unting holy week sundays holy days of obligation first fridays r etreats sacrifices and cyclical impediments her effective year was reduced to fortytwo days that were s pread out th rough a web of purple crosses aureliano segundo convinced that time wo uld break up that host ile network prolonged the wedding celebration be yond the expected time tired of throwing out so many emp ty brandy an d champagn e bottles so that they would not clutter up the house and at the same time intrigued by the fact that th e newlyweds s lept at different times an d in separate rooms whi le the fireworks and music and the slaughtering of cattle wen t on úrsula remem bered her own experience and wondered whether fer nanda might have a chas tity belt too which would s ooner or later provoke jokes in the town and give rise to a tragedy but fernanda confessed to her that she was just letting two weeks go by before allowing the first contact with her h usband indeed when the period was over she opened her bedroom wi th a resignation worthy of an expi atory victim a nd aurelian o segundo saw the most beautiful woman on earth with her glorious eyes of a frightened animal and her long copper colored hair spread out across the pillow he was so fascinated with that vision that it took him a moment to r ealize tha t fernanda was wearing a white nightgown that rea ched down to her ankles with long sleeves and with a large round buttonh ole delicatel y trimmed a t the level o f her lower stomach au reliano segundo could not suppress an explosion of laughter “that’s the most obscen e thing i’ve ever seen in my life” h e shouted with a laugh that rang through the house “i married a sister of charity” a month la ter unsucces sful in getting his wife to take off her nightgown he had th e picture taken of petra cotes dressed as a queen later on when he succeeded in getting fernanda to come back home she gave in to his ur ges in the fever of reconciliation but she could not g ive him the repose he h ad dreamed about wh en he wen t to f etch her in the city with the thirtytwo belfries aureliano segundo found only a deep feeling of deso lation in her one ni ght a short time before their first ch ild was born fernanda realized that her husband had returned in secret to the bed of petra cotes “that’s what happened” he admitted and he explai ned in a tone of pros trated resignation “i had to do it s o that th e animals would keep on breeding” he need ed a little time to convin ce her about such a strange exp edient but when he finall y did so by means of proofs that seem ed irrefutable th e only promise that fernanda demand ed from him was that he should not be surprised by death in hi s concubine’s bed in that way the thr ee of them continued living without bothering each other aure liano segundo punctual and loving with both of them petra cotes strutti ng because o f the reconci liation and fernanda pretending that she did not know the tru th the pact did not succeed however in incorporating fernanda into the family úrsula insisted i n vain that sh e take off the woolen ruff which she would have o n when she got up from making love and which made the neighbors whisper she could not convince her to use the bathr oom or the night lavatory and sell th e gold cham berpot to c olonel aureliano buendía so that h e could convert it into little fishes amaranta felt so uncomforta ble with her defective dicti on and her habit of using euphemisms to designate everything that she woul d always speak gibberish in front of her “thifis if” she would say “ifis if one fos ofosi f thofosif whosufu cantanta nt statan tand thefesef smufumellu ofosif therisir owfisown shifisifit” one day irritated by the mockery fernanda want ed to know what amara nta was saying and she did not use euphemisms in answering her “i was saying” she told her “that yo u’re one of those people who mix up their ass a nd their ashes” from that time on they did not speak to each othe r again when circumstances deman ded it they would send notes in spite of the visible hostility of the family fernanda did not give up her drive to impose the customs of her ancestor s she put a n end to the custom of eating in the kitchen and whenever an yone was hu ngry and she imposed the obligation of doing it at regular hours at the large table in the dining room covered with a li nen cloth and with silver candlesticks and table service the solemnity o f an act whi ch úrsula ha d considered the most simple one of daily life created a tense atmosph ere against which the sile nt josé arcadio segundo rebelled before anyone else but the custom was i mposed the same as tha t of reciting the rosary before dinner and it drew the attention of the neighbors who soon spread the rumor that the buendías did not sit down to th e table like other mortals but had chan ged the act of eating in to a ki nd of high mass even úrsula’s superstitions with origins that came more from an inspiration of the moment than from tradition came into co nflict with those of fernanda who had inherited them from her parents and kept them defined and catalogued for every occasion as long as úrsula had full use of her faculties some of the old custo ms survived and the life of the family ke pt some q uality of her impulsiveness but when she lost h er sight and th e weight of her years relega ted her to a corner the circ le of rigidity begun by fernanda from the mom ent she arrived finally closed completely and no one but she determined the destiny of the family th e business in pastries and small candy animals that santa sofía d e la piedad had kept up because of úrsula’s wishes was consid ered an unworthy acti vity by fernanda and she lost no time in putting a stop to it the doors of the house wide open from dawn until bedtime were closed during siesta time un der the pretext th at the sun heated up th e bedrooms an d in the end they were closed for good the aloe branch and l oaf of bread that had been hanging over the door since the days of the founding were replaced by a niche with the sacred heart of jesus colonel aureliano buendía became aware s omehow of those chan ges and foresaw their consequences “we’re becoming people of quality” he protested “at this rate we’ll end up fighting against th e conservative regime again but this time to install a king in its place” fernanda very tactfully tried not to cross his path within herself she was bothere d by his independent spirit his resistance to all kinds of social rigidity she was exa sperated by his mugs of coffee at five in the m orning the disorder of his workshop his frayed blanket and hi s custom of sitting in the street door at dusk but she had to tolerate that one loose piece in the family machinery because she was sure that the old colonel was an animal who had been tamed by the years and by disappointment and who in a burst of senile rebellion was quite capable of uprootin g the foundations of the house when her husband decided to g ive their first son the name of hi s greatgrandfather she did not dare oppose him because she had been th ere only a year but when the first daughter was bom she expressed her unreserved determinatio n to name her renata after her mother úrsula had decid ed to call h er remedios after a tense argument in which au reliano segundo acted as the laughing gobetween they baptized her with the name renata remedios but fernanda went on calling her just renata while her husband’s family and everyo ne in to wn called her meme a diminutive of remedios at first fernanda did not talk about her family but in time she began to id ealize her father she spoke of him at the tabl e as an excep tional being who had renounced all forms of vanit y and was on his way to b ecoming a sa int aureliano segundo startl ed at that unbridled glorification of his father inlaw could not resist th e temptation to make sm all jokes behind his wife’s back the rest of the family followed his example even úrsula who wa s extremely careful to preserve family harmony and who suffered in secr et from th e domestic fricti on once allowed herself the liberty o f saying tha t her little greatgreatgran dson had his pontifical fu ture assured because he was “the g randson of a saint and the son of a que en and a rustler” in spite of that conspiracy of smiles the children becam e accustom ed to think of their grandfather as a le gendary being who wrote them pious verses in his letters and every christmas sent them a box of gi fts that barely fitted through the outside door actually they were th e last remains of his lordly i nheritance they used th em to build an al tar of life size saints in the children ’s bedroom saints with glass eyes th at gave them a disquietingly lifelike look whose artistically embroidered clothing was b etter than that worn by any inhabita nt of macon do little by little the funereal splendor of the ancient and icy mansion wa s being transformed into the splendor of the house of buendía “they’ve already sent us the w hole family cemetery” aureliano segundo commented one day “all we need no w are the weeping will ows and the tombstones ” although nothing ever arrived in t he boxes th at the childr en could play with they would spend all year waiting for december because after all the antique a nd always u npredictabl e gifts were something new in the h ouse on th e tenth chri stmas when little josé arcadio was getting ready to go to the seminary the enormou s box from their grandfather arrived earlier than usual nailed tight and protected with pitch and addressed in the usual gothic letters to the very distinguished lady doña fernanda del carpio de buendía while she read the letter in h er room the children hastened to open the box aided as was customary by aureliano segundo they broke the seals opened the cover took out th e protective s awdust and found inside a long lead chest closed by copper bolts aureliano segundo took out the eight bolts as the children wa tched impatiently and he barel y had time to give a cry and push th e children aside when be raised the lead cover and saw don f ernando dressed in black and with a crucifix on his chest his skin broken out in pestilential s ores and coo king slowly in a frothy stew with bub bles like live pearls a short time after the birth of their daughter the unexpected jubilee for colonel a ureliano buendía ordered by th e government to celebra te another anni versary of the treaty of neerlandia was announced it was a decision s o out of line wi th official policy that the colonel spoke ou t violently against it and rej ected the ho mage “it’s the first time i’ve ever hea rd of the wo rd ‘jubilee’ ” he said “but whatever it means it has to be a trick” the small golds mith shop was filled with emissaries much older and more so lemn the la wyers in dar k suits who in other days had flapped about the co lonel like crows had returned when he saw them appear th e same as th e other time when th ey ca me to pu t a stop to the war he coul d not bear th e cynicism of their praise he ordered them to leav e him in peace insisting that he was not a hero of the nation as they said but an artisan without memories whose only dream was to die of fatigue in the oblivion and misery of his little gold fishes what made him most indignant was the word tha t the president of the republic himself planned to be present at the ceremon ies in maco ndo in order to decorate him with the order of merit colonel aureliano buendía had him told word for word that he was eagerly awaiting that tardy but des erved occasi on in order to take a shot at him not as payment f or the arbitrary acts and anachronism s of his regime but for his lack of re spect for an old man who had not don e anyone any harm such was th e veh emence with which h e made the threat th at the president o f the republi c canceled his trip at the la st moment a nd sent the decoration with a persona l representati ve colonel gerineldo márquez besieged by pre ssures of all kinds left his bed of a paralytic in order to persuade his former companion in arms when the latter sa w the rockin g chair carried by four men appear and saw the friend who had shared his victories an d defeats since youth sitting in it among some large pillows he did not have a single doubt but that he was making that effort in order to express his solidarity but when he discovered the real moti ve for his visit he had them take him out of the workshop “now i’m convinced to o late” he told him “that i would h ave done yo u a great fav or if i’d let them shoot you” so the jubilee was celebra ted withou t the attendance of any m embers of the family chance had i t that it also coincided with carnival week but no one could get the stubb orn idea out of colonel aureliano buendía’s head that the coincidence h ad been foreseen by the government in order to heighten the cruelty of the mockery from his lone ly workshop he could hear the martial music the artillery salutes the tollin g of the te deum and a few phrases of the speeches delivered in front of the house as they named the street a fter him hi s eyes grew moist with indignation with angr y impotence a nd for the first time since his defeat i t pained him not to have th e strength of youth so that he coul d begin a bloody war that would wi pe out the last vestiges of the conser vative regime the echoes of the homage had not died down when úrsula knocked at the workshop door “don’t bother me” he said “i’m busy ” “open up” úrsula insist ed in a normal voice “this has nothing to do with the celebra tion” then colonel aureliano buendía too k down the ba r and saw at the door s eventeen men of the most varied appearance of all types and colors but all with a solitary air that would have been enough to id entify them anywhere on earth th ey were his son s without a ny previous agreement without kno wing each other they had arrived from th e most distant corners of the coa st captivated by the talk of the jubilee they all bore with pr ide the name aureliano and the last name of their mothers the three da ys that th ey sta yed in the house to the satisfaction of úrsula and the scand al of fernanda were like a state war am aranta search ed among old papers for the ledger where úrsula had written down the na mes and birth and baptism dates of all of them and beside th e space for each one she added his pr esent addres s that list co uld well ha ve served as a recapitulati on of twenty years of war from it the nocturnal itinerary of the colonel from the dawn he left macondo at the head of twentyone men on his way to a fanciful rebellion until he returned for t he last time wrapped in a blanket stiff with blood could have been reconstr ucted aureliano segundo did not let the chan ce go by to regale his cousins with

the house shook with a health y earthquake colonel aureliano buendía who at first received th em with mistrust and even doubted th e parentag e of some was amused by their wildness and before th ey left he gave each o ne a little gold fish even the withdrawn josé arcadio segundo offered them an afternoon of cockfights which was at the point of ending in tragedy because s everal of the au

the men of their houses peaceloving people the ash wednesday before they went back to scatter out along the coast amar anta got them to put on sunday clothes and acco mpany her to church more amused than devout they let them selves be led to the altar r ail where fa ther antonio isabel made the sign of the cross in ashes on th em back at the house when the youngest tried to clean his fore head he discovered that the mark was indelibl e and so were those of his brothers they tried so ap and water earth an d a scrubbing brush and lastl y a pumice sto ne and lye b ut they could not remove the crosses on the oth er hand am aranta an d the others who had gone to mass to ok it off wi thout any tro uble “it’s better that wa y” úrsula stated as she said goodbye to them “from now on everyone will know who you are” they went off in a troop p receded b y a band of mu sicians and s hooting off fireworks and they left b ehind in th e town an impression that the buendía line had enough seed for many centuries aureliano triste with the cross of ashes on his forehead set up on t he edge of town the ice factory that j osé arcadio buendía had dreamed of in his inventive delirium some month s after his arrival when he was al ready wellknown and wellliked aureliano triste went abou t looking for a house so th at he could s end for his mother and an unmarried sister who was not the colonel’s da ughter and he became in terested in the rundown big house that looked abandoned on a corner of the squar e he asked w ho owned it someone told him that it did not belong to an yone tha t in former times a solit ary widow who fed on earth and whitewash from the walls had lived there and that in her last years she was seen only twice on the street with a hat of tiny artificial flowers and shoes the col or of old si lver when she crossed the s quare to the post office to mail a letter to the bishop they told him that her only companion was a pitiless se rvant woman who killed dogs and cats and any animal that got into the house and threw their corpses into th e middle of the street in or der to annoy people with the ro tten stench so mu ch time had passed since the sun had mummified the empty skin of the last an imal that everybody took it for granted that the lady of the h ouse and the maid had di ed long before the wars were over a nd that if th e house was still standing it was because in recent years there had not been a rough wi nter or destr uctive wind the hinges h ad crum bled with rust th e doors were held up only by clouds of cobwebs the windows were soldered shut by d ampness an d the floor wa s broken by grass and wildflowers and in th e cracks lizards and all manner of vermin had their nests all of which seemed to confi rm the notion that there ha d not been a human being there for at least half a century the impulsive aureliano triste did not need such proof to proceed he pu shed on the main door with his shoulder and the wormeaten wooden fra me fell down noiselessly amid a dull cata clysm o f dust and termite nes ts aureliano triste stood on the threshol d waiting for the dust to clear and then he saw in th e center of the room the squalid woman still dressed in clothing of the past century with a few yellow threads on her bald head and wi th two larg e eyes still beautiful in which th e last stars of hope had gone out and the skin of her face was wrinkled by the aridity of solitude shaken by that vision from another worl d aureliano triste barel y noticed that the wo man was aimin g an antiqua ted pistol at him “i beg your pardon” he murmured she remained motionless in the center of the ro om filled with knickknacks examining inch by inch the giant with square shoulders and with a tattoo of ashes on his forehead and through the haze of dust she saw him in the haze of other ti mes with a doublebarreled shotgun on his shoulder and a string of rabbits in his hand “for the love of god” she said in a l ow voice it ’s not right for them to come to m e with that memory no w” “i want to rent the house ” aureliano triste said the woman then raised the pistol aiming with a fi rm wrist at the cross of ashes and she held th e trigger with a determinati on against which there was no appeal “get out” she ordered that night a t dinner aur eliano triste told the fa mily about the episode a nd úrsula wept with consternation “holy god” she exclaimed clutchin g her head with her hands “she’s still alive” time wars the countl ess everyday di sasters had made her fo rget about r ebeca the o nly one who had not lost for a single minute the a wareness th at she was alive and rotting in her wormhole was the implacab le and aging amaranta s he thought of her at dawn when the ice of her heart awakened her in her solitary bed and she thought of her wh en she soaped her withered breasts and her lean stomach an d when she put on the white stiffstarch ed petticoats and cor sets of old age and when she changed the black bandage of terrible expiati on on her hand always at every moment asleep and awake during the most sub lime and most abject moments am aranta thought a bout rebeca because solitude had made a selection in her memory and had burned the di mming piles of nostalgic waste that life had accum ulated in her heart and had purified magnified and eternalized the oth ers the most bitter ones rem edios the b eauty knew ab out rebeca’s existence from her every time they passed the r undown house she would tell her about an unpleasant inciden t a tale of hate trying in that way to make her extended rancor be shared by her niece and consequently prolonged beyond death but her plan did not work because remedios was immune to any k ind of passionate feeling s and much less to those of others úrsula on the other hand who had suffered through a process opposite to amaranta’s recalled reb eca with a memory free of im purities for the image of the pitiful child brought to the house with the bag containing her parents’ bones prevailed over the offense that had made her unworth y to be co nnected to th e family tree any longer aureliano segundo decided that they would have to bring her to the house and take care of her but his good intentions were frustrated by the firm intransigence of rebeca who had needed ma ny years of sufferin g and misery in order to attain the priv ileges of solitude and who was no t disposed to renounce them in exchan ge for an old age dist urbed by the fals e attractions of charity in february when the si xteen sons of colonel aureliano buendía returned still marked with the cross of ashes aureliano triste spok e to them about rebeca in the tumult of the cel ebration and in half a day they restored the appeara nce of the ho use changing doors and windows painting the front with gay colors bracing walls and pouring fresh cement on the floor but they co uld not get any authorization to continue the work inside rebeca did not even come to the door she let them finish the mad restoratio n then calcu lated wha t it had cost an d sent argén ida her old servant who was still with her to them with a handful of coins that had been withdrawn from circulation after the last war and that rebeca thou ght were still worth something it was then that they saw to what a fantastic poi nt her separ ation from the world had arrived and they understood that i t would be impossible to rescue her from her stubborn enclo sure while she still had a breath of life in her on the second visit by t he sons of colonel au reliano buendía to macondo another of them aureliano centeno stayed on to work with aurelia no triste he was one of the first who had been brought to t he house for baptism and úrsula and am aranta remembered h im very well because in a few hours he had d estroyed every breakable obj ect th at passed thro ugh his hands time ha d moderated h is early impu lse for growth and h e was a man of average hei ght marked by smallpox scars but his amazing power for manual destruction remained intact he broke so many plates even without tou ching them that fernand a decided to buy him a s et of pewterware before he did away with the last pieces of her expensive china and ev en the resista nt metal plates were soon dented an d twisted but to make up f or that irremediable power which was exasperating even for hi m he h ad a cordiality th at won the i mmediate co nfidence of others and a stupendous capaci ty for work in a short time he had increased the production of ice to such a degree that it wa s too much for the local market and aureliano triste had to think about the possibility of expanding the business to other towns in the swamp it was then that he thought of the decisive step not only for the modernizatio n of his business but to link the town with the rest of the world “we have to bring in the railroad” he s aid that was the first time that the word had ever been heard in macondo looking at the sketch that aurelia no triste drew on th e table and tha t was a direct descen dent of the plans with which josé arcadio buendía ha d illustrated his project fo r solar warfare úrsula confirmed her impression that time wa s going in a circle but unlike his fo rebear aureliano triste did not lose any sleep or appetite nor did he torment anyone wi th crises of ill humor but he considered the most harebrained of projects a s immediate possibilities made rationa l calculations about costs and dates and brought them off without any intermediate ex asperation if aureliano segundo had something of his great grandfather in him and lacked something of colonel aureliano buendía it was an absolute indifference to mockery and he gave the mon ey to bring the r ailroad with the sam e lighthearted air with which he had given it for his brother’s absurd navigation project aureliano triste consulted the calendar and left th e following wednesday pl anning to return after the rains had passed ther e was no mor e news of hi m aureliano centeno o verwhelmed by the abun dance of th e factory had already begun to experiment with the production of ice with a base of fruit juices instead of water and without knowing it or thinking about it he conceived the essenti al fundamen tals for th e invention of sherbet in that way he planned to diversify the producti on of an e nterprise he considered his own because his brother showed no signs of returning after t he rains had passed and a whole summer had gone by with no news of hi m at the start of another winter however a woman who was washing clothes in th e river during the hottest time of the day ran screa ming down the main street in an alar ming state of commotion “it’s coming” she finally explained “something fr ightful like a kitchen dr agging a village behind it” at tha t moment the to wn was sha ken by a whistle with a fearful echo and a loud panting respiration during the previous weeks they h ad seen the gangs who were la ying ties and tracks an d no one paid attention to them because they thoug ht it was so me new trick of the gypsies coming back with whistles and tambourines and their ag eold and discredited song and dance about the qualities of some con coction put to gether by jo urneyman g eniuses of jerusalem b ut when they recovered from the noise of the whistles and the s norting all the inhabitants ran out into the street and saw aur eliano triste waving from the locomotive and in a trance th ey saw the flowerbedecked train which was arriving for the first time eight months late t he innocent yellow train that was to bring so many ambiguities and certa inties so ma ny pleasant and unpleasant moments so many changes cala mities and feelings of nostalgia to macondo chapter daz zled by so m any and such marvelous inventions the people of macondo did not know where their amazement began they stayed up all night looking at the pale electric bulbs fed by the plant that aurelia no triste had brought back when th e train made its second trip and it took time and effort for them to grow a ccustom ed to its obsess ive toomtoom they be came indignant over the living images that the pro sperous merchant bruno crespi projected in the theater wi th the lionhea d ticket windows for the character who had died and was buried in one film and for whose misfortune tears of afflic tion had been shed woul d reappear al ive and trans formed into an arab in the next on e the audien ce who paid two cents a piece to sh are the difficulties of the a ctors would not tolerate that outlandi sh fraud and they broke up the seats the mayor at the urging of bruno crespi expla ined in a pro clamation that the cinema was a machine of illus ions that did not merit the emotional o utbursts of the audience with that d iscouraging explanation many felt that they had been th e victims of som e new and showy gypsy business and they decid ed not to return to th e movies cons idering that they alread y had too many troubles of their own to weep ov er the actedout misfortunes of imaginary beings something si milar happened with the cylinder phonographs that the m erry m atrons from france brought with th em as a substitute for the antiquated hand organs and that for a time had serious effects on the liveli hood of the band of musicians at first curiosity increased th e clientele o n the forbidden street a nd there was even word of respectable ladies who disguised themselves as workers in order to obs erve the novelty of the phonograph from first hand but from so much and such close observation they soon reached the concl usion that it was not an enchanted mill as everyone had thought and as th e matrons had said but a mechanical trick that could not b e comp ared with someth ing so moving so huma n and so fu ll of everyda y truth as a band of musicians it was such a serious disappoi ntment that when phonographs became so popular that there wa s one in every house they were not co nsidered objects for amusement for adults but as something good for children to take apart on the other hand when someone from the town had the opportu nity to test the crude reality of the tele phone installed in the railroad station which was thought to be a rudimentary version of the phonograph because of its crank even the most incredulous were upset it was as if god had d ecided to put to th e test every cap acity for surprise and was keeping the inh abitants of macondo in a permanen t alterna tion between excitemen t and disappointment doubt and revelation to such an extreme that no one k new for certain where the limits of reality lay it was an intricate stew of truths and mira ges that con vulsed the g host of josé arcadio buendía under the ches tnut tree with impatience and made him wander all through the house even i n broad dayl ight ever since the railr oad had been officially inaugurated and had begun to arrive with regularity on wednesd ays at eleven o’clock and the primitive wooden station with a desk a telep hone and a ticket windo w had been built on the streets of macondo men and women were seen who had adop ted everyda y and normal customs an d manners b ut who reall y looked like people out o f a circus in a town that had chafed under the tricks of the gyp sies there wa s no future for those am bulatory acr obats of co mmerce who with equal effrontery offered a whistl ing kettle an d a daily regime that would assure the sal vation of th e soul on the seventh day but from those who let themselves be convinced out of fatigue and the ones wh o were alwa ys unwary they reaped stupendous benefits am ong those th eatrical crea tures wearing riding breeches and leg gings a pith helmet a nd steelrimmed glasses with topaz eyes and the skin of a thin rooster there arrived in macondo on one of so many wednesdays the ch ubby and smiling mr herbert who ate at the house no one had noticed him at the table until the first bunch of bananas had been eaten aureliano segundo had come across him by chance as he pr otested in br oken spanish because th ere were n o rooms at the hotel jacob and as he frequently did with strangers he took him home he was in the captiveballoon business which had taken him halfwa y around the world wi th excellent profits but he had not succeeded in taking anyone up in macondo beca use they co nsidered tha t invention backward after having seen and tried the gypsies’ flying carpets he was l eaving therefore on th e next train when they brought to the table th e tigerstriped bunch of bananas that they wer e accustom ed to hang in the dining room during lunc h he picked the first piece of fruit without grea t enthusiasm but he kep t on eating as he spoke tas ting chewin g more with the distra ction of a wise man than wi th the delight of a good eater and when he finished the first bunch he as ked them to bring him a nother then he took a small case with optical instruments out of the toolbox that he always carried with him with the a uspicious attention of a diamond merchant he ex amined th e banana meti culously dissecting it with a special sc alpel weighing the pieces on a ph arma cist’s scale and calculati ng its breadth with a gunsmith’s caliper s then he took a serie s of instrum ents out of the ch est wi th which he measured th e temp erature the level of humidity in the a tmosp here and th e intensity of the light it was such an in triguing cerem ony that n o one could eat in pea ce as everybody waited for mr herbert to pass a final and revea ling judgme nt but he d id not say anything that allowed anyo ne to guess his intentions on the days that followed he was seen with a net and a small basket hunting butterflies on the outskirts of town on wednesday a group of en gineers agronomists hydrologists t opographers and surveyors arrived who for several weeks explored the places where mr herbert had hunted his butterflies later on mr jack brown a rrived in an extra coach that had been coupled onto the yellow train and that was silverplated all over with seats of episcopal velvet and a r oof of blue glass also arriving on the special ca r fluttering around mr brown were the solemn lawyers dres sed in black who in different times had followed colonel aureliano buendía everywhere and tha t led the peopl e to think that the agronomists hydrologists topog raphers and surveyors like mr herbert with hi s captive balloons and his colored butterflies and mr brown with his mau soleum on wheels and hi s ferocious german shepherd dogs had something to do with th e war there was not mu ch time to think about it however because the suspicious in habitants of macondo barely began to wonder what the d evil was going on when the town had al ready becom e transformed into an encampmen t of wooden houses with zinc roofs inhabited by fo reigners wh o arrived on the train from halfwa y around the world riding not only on the seats an d platforms but even on the roof of the coach es the gringos who la ter on brought th eir languid wive s in muslin dresses and large veiled hats built a separate town across the railroad tracks with streets lined with palm trees houses with screened win dows small white tables on the terraces and fans mounted on the ceilings and extensiv e blue lawns with peacocks and quails the secti on was surrounded by a metal fence topped with a band of electrified chicken wire which during the cool summer mornings would be black with roasted swallows no one knew yet what they were after or whether they were actually nothing but philanthropists and they had already caused a colossa l disturbance much more than that of the ol d gypsies but less transitory and understandable endowed with means tha t had been reserved for divine providence in former times they ch anged the pattern of the rams accelerated the cycle of harvest and moved the river from where it had always been a nd put it with its white stones and icy currents on the other side of the town behind the cemetery it was at tha t time that they built a fortress of reinforced concrete over the faded tomb of josé arcadio so that the cor pses smell of powder would not contaminate th e waters for th e foreigners who arrived without love they converted the street of the loving matrons from france into a more extensive village than it had been and on one glorious wednesday they brou ght in a trainload of strange whores babylonish women skilled in ageold methods and in possessi on of all manner of unguents and devices to stimulate the unaroused to give courage to the ti mid to satia te the voraci ous to exalt the modes t man to teach a lesson to repeaters a nd to correct solitary peo ple the street of the tur ks enriched by welllit stores with products from abroad disp lacing the old bazaars with their bright colors overflowed on saturday nights with the crowds of adventurers who bumped into each other among gambling tables shooting galleries the alley wher e the future was guessed and dreams interpreted and tables o f fried food and drinks and on sund ay mornings there were scattered o n the ground bodies that were someti mes those of happy drunka rds and more often those of onlookers felled by shots fists knives and b ottles during the braw ls it was such a tumultuous a nd intemper ate invasion that during the first days it was impos sible to walk through the streets beca use of the furniture and trunks and the noise of the carpentry of those who were building their houses in any vacant lot without asking anyone’s permission and the sc andalous behavior of c ouples who hung their hammocks b etween the al mond trees a nd made love un der the netting in broad daylight and in view of everyone the only serene corner had been established by peaceful west indian negroes who built a marginal street with wooden houses on piles where they would sit in the doors at dusk singing melancholy hymns in their d isordered gabbl e so many changes took place in such a shor t time that eig ht months after mr herbert’s visit th e old inhabitants had a hard time recognizing their own town “look at the mess we’ve got ourselves into” colon el aureliano buendía said at that time “just because we invited a gringo to eat so me bananas ” aureliano segundo on t he other hand could not contain his happiness over the avalanche of foreigners the house was suddenly filled with unknown guests with invincible and worldly carousers and it became necessary to add bedroom s off the courtyard widen the dining room and exchange th e old table for one that held sixteen people with new china a nd silver and even then they had to eat lunch in shifts fernanda had to swallow her scruples and their guests of the worst sort like kings as they m uddied the porch with thei r boots urinated in the garden laid their mats down anywh ere to take their siesta and spoke withou t regard for the sens itivities of la dies or the proper behavior of gentlemen amar anta was so scandalized with the plebeian invasi on that she went b ack to eating in th e kitchen as in olde n days colonel aureliano buendía convinced that th e majority of those who came into his workshop to greet him were not doing it becaus e of sympathy or regard but out of the curiosity to meet a histor ical relic a museum fossil decided to shut himself in by barring the door an d he was not seen any m ore except o n very rare occasions when he woul d sit at the street door úrsula on the o ther hand even during th e days when she was alrea dy dragging her feet and walking ab out groping along the walls fe lt a ju venile excitement as th e time for the arrival of the train approached “we have to prepare some meat and fish” she would order the four cooks who hastened to have everyth ing ready unde r the imperturbable direction of sa nta sofía de l a piedad “we have to prep are everythin g” she insi sted “because we never know what these strangers like to eat” the train arrived during the hottest ti me of day at lunchtime the house sh ook with the bustle of a marketplace and the pers piring guests—who did n ot even kno w who th eir hosts were— trooped in to occupy the best places at the tabl e while the cooks bumped into each other with enormous kettles of soup pots of meat large gourds filled with vegetables and troughs of rice and passed aroun d the con tents of barrels of lemonade with inexha ustible ladles the disorder was such that fernand a was troubl ed by th e idea that many were ea ting twice and o n more than o ne occasion she was abo ut to burst out with a vegetable ha wker’s insults because someone a t the table in confusion asked her for the check m ore than a year had gone by since mr herbert’s visit and the only thing that was known was that th e gringos were planning to plant banana trees in the enchanted region that josé arcadio buendía and his men had crossed in search of the route to the great inventions two other sons of colonel aureliano buendía with the cross of ashes on their foreheads arrived drawn by that grea t volcanic belch and they justified their determination with a phrase that may have ex plained everybody’s reasons “we came” they said “because everyone is comin g” remedios the beauty was the only one who was immune to the banana plague she was becalmed in a magnificent adolescence more and more impen etrable to formality more and more indifferent to malice and suspicion happy in her own world of simple realities she did not understand why women co mplicated th eir lives with co rsets and petticoats so sh e sewed h erself a coarse cassock that she simply put over her and without further diffi culties resolved the problem of dress without taking away the feeling of being naked which a ccording to her lights was th e only d ecent way to be when at home they bothered her so much to cut the rain of hair that already reached to her thighs and to make rolls with combs and braids with red ribbons that s he simply shaved her head and used the hair to make wigs for the saints the startlin g thing about her simplifying instinct was that t he more she did away with fashion in a search for comfort and the more she passed over conventions as she obeyed spontaneity the mor e disturbing her incredible beauty became and the mor e provocative she became to men when the sons of colonel aur eliano buend ía were in m acondo for the first time úrsula remembered that in thei r veins they bore the same blood as her great granddaughter and she s huddered with a forgotten fright “keep your eyes wide open” she warned her “with any of them your children will come out with the tail of a pig” the girl paid such little attention to the warning that she dressed up as a man and rolled around in the sand in order to climb the greased pole and she was at the point of bringing on a trage dy among the seventeen cousins who were driven mad by the unbearable specta cle that was why n one of them slept at th e house when they visited the town and the four w ho had stayed lived in rented rooms at úrsula’s insistence r emedios the beauty however would ha ve died laughing if she had known about that precaution until her last moment on earth she was unaware that her irreparable fate as a disturbing woman was a daily disaster every time she appeared in the dining room a gainst úrsula’s orders she caused a p anic of exasperation among the outsider s it was all too evident that she was completely naked underneath her crude nightshirt and no one could understand tha t her shaved and perfect skull was not some kind of challenge and that the boldness with which she uncovered her thighs to cool off was not a criminal provocation nor wa s her pleasure when she sucked her fingers after eating what no member of the family ever knew was that the strangers did not take lon g to realize that remedi os the beauty gave off a breath of perturbation a tormenting breeze that was still perceptible several hours after she had passed by men expert in the disturbances of love experienced all over the world stated that they had never suffered an anxiety similar to the one produced by the natural smell of remedios the beauty on the porch with the bego nias in the parlor in any place in th e house it was possible to point out the exact place where she had been an d the time that had passed since she had left it it wa s a definite unmistakable trace that n o one in the family could distinguish b ecause it had been incorpor ated into the daily odo rs for a long time but it was one th at the outsi ders identified immediat ely they were the onl y ones ther efore who understood how th e you ng com mander of the guard had died of love and how a gentleman from a faraway land had been pl unged into desperation un aware of the restless circle in which she moved of the unbearable state of inti mate calamity that she provoked as she p assed by remedios th e beauty treated the m en without the least bit of ma lice and in the end upset them with h er innocen t complaisance when úrsula succeeded in imposing the command that she eat with ama ranta in the kitchen so th at the ou tsiders would not see her she felt more co mfortable because after all she was beyond all discipline in reality it made no differe nce to her wh ere she ate and not at reg ular hours but according to the whims of her appetite someti mes she would get up to have lunch at three in the morning sleep all da y long and she spent several months wi th her tim etable all in disarray unti l some casual incident wou ld bring her back into the order of things when things were going better she would g et up at elev en o’clock in the morning and shut herself up until two o’clock completely nude in the bathroom killing scorpions as she came out of her dense and prolonged sleep then she would throw water from the cistern over hersel f with a gourd it was an act so prolonged so meticulous so rich in ceremonial aspects that one who did not know her w ell would have thought that she was given over to the deserv ed adoratio n of her own body for her however that solitary rite lacked al l sensuality a nd was simp ly a way of p assing the time until she was hungry one day as she began to bathe herself a stranger lifted a tile from the roof and was breathless at the tremendous spectacl e of her nudity she saw his d esolate eyes through the broken tiles and had no reaction of shame but ra ther one of a larm “be careful” she exclaim ed “you’ll fall” “i just wanted to see you ” the foreigner murmured “oh all right” she said “but be careful those tiles are rotten” the stranger’s face had a pained ex pression of st upor and he seemed to be battling silently against his primary instincts so as not to break up the mirage remedios th e beauty tho ught that h e was sufferin g from the fear that the tiles would br eak and she bathed herself more quickly than usual so that the man would not be in danger while she was pouring water from the cistern she told him that the roof was in that state because she thought that the bed of leaves had been rotted by the rain and that was what was filling the bathroom with sc orpions the stranger thought that her small talk was a way of covering her complaisance so th at when she began to soap herself he gave into tempta tion a nd went a step further “let me soap you” he murmured “thank you for your good intentions” she said “but my two hands are quite enough” “even if it’s just your ba ck” the foreigner begged “that would be silly” she said “people never soap their backs” then while she was drying herself the stranger begged her with his eyes full of tears to marry him she answered him sincerely that she would never marry a man who was so simple that he ha d wasted almo st an hour an d even wen t without lunch just to see a woman tak ing a bath finally when she put on her cassock the man could not bear the proof that indeed she was not wear ing anything underneath as everyone had suspected and he felt himself marked forever with the whitehot iron of that secret then he to ok two more tiles off in order to drop down into th e bathroom “it’s very high” she warned him in fright “you’ll kill yourself” the rotten tiles broke with a noise of disaster an d the man barely had time to let out a cry of terror as he cracked his skull and was killed outrig ht on the cement floor the foreigne rs who heard the noise in the dining room and hastened to remove the body noticed the suffocating odor of remedios th e beauty on his skin it was so deep in his body that the cracks in his skull did not give off blood but an amber colored oil that was impreg nated wi th tha t secret perfume a nd then they understood that the sm ell of remedios the beauty kept on torturing men beyond death right down to the dust of their bon es nevertheless they did not rela te that horrible accident to the other two men who had died because of remedios the beauty a victim was still needed before the outsider s and many of the old inhabitants of macondo would credit the legend that remedi os buendía did not give off a breath of love but a fatal emanation the occasion for the proof of it came some months later on one afternoon when remedios the beauty went with a group of girl friends to look at the new plantin gs for the girls of macondo that n ovel game was reason f or laughter and surprises frights and jokes and at night they would talk about their wal k as if it had been an exp erience in a dream such was the prestige of that silence that úrsula did not have the heart to take the fun awa y from remedios the beau ty and she let her go one afternoon providing that she wore a hat and a decent dress as soon as the group of friends wen t into the plantings the air became impregnated with a fatal fragrance the men wh o were wor king along t he rows felt possessed by a strange fascination menaced by some invisible danger an d many succumbed to a terrible desire to weep remedios th e beauty and her startled friends manage d to take refuge in a nearby house just as they were abou t to be assaulted by a pack of ferocious males a sho rt time l ater they were rescued by the flour aurelianos whose crosses of ash inspired a sacred respect as if they were caste m arks stamps of invulnerability remedios the bea uty did not tell an yone that one of the me n taking advantage of the tumult had managed to attack her stomach with a hand that was more like the claw of an eagle clinging to the edge of a precipice she faced the attacker in a kind of instantaneous flash and saw the dis consolate eyes which remained stamped o n her heart like the hot coal s of pity th at night th e man boasted of his audacity and swa ggered over his good luck on the street of the turks a few minutes bef ore the kick of a horse crushed his ch est and a crowd of outsiders saw him die in the middle of the street dro wned in his own bloody vomiting the supposition that r emedios the beauty poss essed power s of death was then borne out by four irrefutable events although some men wh o were easy with their words said that it was worth sacrificing one’s life for a night of love with suc h an arousing woman the truth was that no one made any ef fort to do so perhaps not only to atta in her but also to conjure away her dangers all that was needed was a feeling as primitive and as simple as that of love but that was the only thing that did not occur to anyone úrsula did not worry about her any more on another occasion when she had no t yet given up the idea of saving her for the world she had tried to get h er interested in basic domes tic affairs “men deman d much more than you think” she would tell her enigmatically “there’s a lot of cooking a lot of sweeping a l ot of suffering over little things beyo nd what you think” she was deceiving herself within trying to train her for domestic happiness because she was convinced that once his passion was satisfied them would no t be a m an on the face of the earth capable of to lerating even for a day a negligence th at was beyond all understanding the birth of the latest josé arcadio and her unshakable will to brin g him up to be pope finally caused her to cease worrying about her greatgranddaughter she aban done d her to her fate trusting that so oner or later a miracle would take place and that in this worl d of everything there would also be a man with enough sloth to put up w ith her for a long time already amaranta had given up trying to make her into a useful woman since those forgotten afterno ons when her niece b arely had enough interest to turn the cra nk on the sewing machine she had re ached th e conclusion that she was sim pleminded “were going to have to r affle you off” she would tell her per plexed at th e fact th at men’s words would not penetrate h er later on when úrsula insi sted that remedios th e beauty go to mass with her face covered with a s hawl amara nta thought that a mysterious recourse like that wo uld turn out to be so provoking that soon a man would come who would be intrigued enough to search ou t patiently for the weak poi nt of her heart but wh en she sa w the stupid way in which sh e rejected a pretender who for many reasons was more desira ble than a pr ince she gav e up all hop e fernanda did not even make any attempt to un derstand he r when she s aw remedio s the beau ty dressed as a queen at the bloody carn ival she thou ght that sh e was an extra ordinary creature but when she sa w her eating with her hand s incapable of giving an answer th at was not a miracle of simplemind edness the only thing that she lamen ted was the fact that the idiots in the family lived so long in spite of the fact tha t colo nel aureliano buendía ke pt on believ ing and repeating that remedios the beauty was i n reality the most lucid being that he had ever known and tha t she showed it at every moment with her startli ng ability to put things over on everyone they l et her go her own way remedios th e beauty sta yed there wan dering throu gh the desert of solitude bearing no cross on her back maturing in her dreams withou t nightmares her interminable baths her unscheduled meals her deep and prolonged silences that had no memory until one afternoon in march when fernand a wanted to fold her braba nt sheets in the garden an d asked the women in the house for help she ha d just begun when amara nta noticed that remedi os the beauty was covered all over by an intens e paleness “don’t you feel well” she asked her remedios th e beauty wh o was clutchi ng the sheet by the oth er end gave a pitying smile “quite the o pposite” she said “i neve r felt better” she had just finished saying it when fernanda fe lt a delica te wind of light pull the sheets out o f her hands and open them up wide amaranta felt a mysterious trembling in the lace on her petticoa ts and she tried to grasp the sheet so th at she would not fall down at the ins tant in which remedios th e beauty beg an to rise úrsula almost blind at the time was the only person who was sufficiently calm to identi fy the nature of that d etermined wind and she left the sheets to the mercy of the light as she watched remedios the beauty waving goodbye in the midst of the flapping sheets th at rose up with her aband oning with her the environment of beetles a nd dahlias and passing through the air with her as four o’clock in the afterno on came to a n end and they were los t forever with her in the up per atmosph ere where n ot even th e highestflying birds of m emory could reach her the outsiders of course thought that rem edios the b eauty had finally succumb ed to her irrevocable fate of a queen bee and that her family was trying to save her honor with that tale of levitation fernanda burning with envy finally accep ted the mi racle and for a long time she kept on praying to god to s end her back her sheets most people believed in the miracle and they ev en lighted candles and celeb rated noven as perhaps ther e might have been ta lk of nothing else for a long time if t he barbarous exterminati on of the aurelianos had not replaced amazement with honor although he had never thought of it as an omen colonel aur eliano buend ía had foreseen the tragic end of his sons in a certain way when aureliano serrador and aureliano arcaya the two who arrived durin g the tumult expressed a wish to stay in macondo their father tried to dissuade them he could no t understand what they were going to do in a to wn that had been transfo rmed into a dangerous place overnight but aureliano cente no and aureliano triste backed by aureliano segundo gave them work in their bu sinesses colonel aureliano buendía had reasons that were stil l very confused and were a gainst that d etermination when he sa w mr brown in the first automobil e to reach macondo—an orange convertible with a hor n that frightened dogs with its bark—the old soldier grew indignant with the servile excitement of the people and he realized that something had changed in the makeup of the men s ince the d ays when th ey would leave their wives a nd children and toss a s hotgun on their shoulders to go off to wa r the local authorities after the armistice o f neerlandia were mayors without initiative decorati ve judges picked from among the peaceful and tired conservatives of macon do “this is a regime of wretches” colonel aureliano buendía woul d comment when he s aw the barefoot policemen ar med with wooden clubs p ass “we fought all thos e wars and all of it just so that we didn’t have to paint our hous es blue” when the banana compan y arrived however the local functionaries were repl aced by dictatorial foreigners whom mr brow n brought to live in the el ectrified chicken yard so th at they could enjoy as he explained it the dignity that their sta tus warranted and so that they would not suffer from the heat and the mos quitoes and the countles s discomforts and privations of the town the old policemen were replaced by hired assassins with machetes shut up in his work shop colonel au reliano buendía thought about those changes and for the first time in his qu iet years of solitude he was tormented by the d efinite certainty that it had been a mistake not to have continued the war to its final conclusion during that time a brother of the forgotten colonel magnífico visbal was taking his sevenyea rold grandson to get a soft drink at one of the pushcarts on the square and because the child accidentally bumped into a corporal of police and spilled the dr ink on his unif orm the barbarian cut hi m to pieces with his machete an d with one stroke he cut off the head of the grandfather as he tried to stop him the whole town saw the deca pitated man pass by as a group of m en carried him to his house with a woman dragging the head along by its hair and the bloody sack with the pi eces of the child for colonel aureliano buendía it meant the li mits of atonement he s uddenly found himself sufferin g from the same indignation that he had felt in his you th over the body of the woman wh o had been beaten to death becaus e she had b een bitten b y a rabid dog he looked a t the groups of bystanders i n front of the house and with his old s tentorian voice restored by a deep disgust with himself he unloaded upon them the burden of ha te that he cou ld no longer bear in his heart “one of these days” he shouted i’m going to arm my boys so we can get rid of these shitty gringos ” during the course of th at week at different places along th e coast his seventeen sons were hunted down like rabbits by invisible criminals w ho aimed at the center of their crosses of ash aureliano triste was leav ing the house with his mother at sev en in the ev ening when a rifle shot came out of the darkness and perforated his forehead aureliano centeno was found in the hammock th at he was accustomed to hang up in the factory with an icepick between his eyebrows driven in up to the handle aureliano serrador had le ft his girl friend at her parents’ house after having taken her to the movies and was returnin g through the welllighted street of the turks wh en someone in the crowd wh o was never identified fire d a revolver shot which knocked him over into a caldron of boiling lard a few minutes later some one knocked at the door of the r oom where aureliano arcaya was shut up with a woman and s houted to him “hurry up they’re killing your brothers” the woman who was with him said l ater that aureliano arcaya jumped ou t of bed and opened the door and was greeted with the discha rge of a mauser that split his head open on that night of death while the house was preparing to hold a wak e for the fo ur corpses fernanda ran through the town like a madwoman l ooking for au reliano segundo whom petra cotes had locked up in a closet thinking that the ord er of exterm ination inclu ded all who bore the col onel’s name she would not let him o ut until the fourth day wh en the telegrams received from different places along the coast made it clear that the fury of th e invisible enemy was directed only at the brothers marked with the crosses of ash amaranta fetched the ledger where she had written down the facts about her nephews and as the telegra ms arrived sh e drew lines through th e nam es unti l only tha t of the eldest remained they remem bered him very we ll because of the contr ast between his dark skin and his green eyes his name was aureliano amador and he was a carpenter living in a village hidden in the foothills after waiting two weeks for the telegram telling of his deat h aureliano segundo sent a messenger to him in order to warn him thinking that he mi ght not know about the threat tha t hung over him the emissary returned with the n ews that au reliano ama dor was safe the night of the extermi nation two men had gone to get hi m at his hou se and had s hot at him with their revolvers but they h ad missed th e cross of as hes aureliano amador had been able to leap over the wall of the courtyard and was lost in the labyrinth of the mountains which he knew like the back of his hand t hanks to the friendship he maintain ed with the indians from whom he bought wood nothing more was heard of him those were dark days for colonel aureliano buendía the president of th e republic sent him a telegram of condolence i n which he promised an exhaustive investigation and paid homage to the dead men at his comma nd the mayo r appeared at th e services with four funeral wreath s which he tried to place on the coffins but the colonel ordered him into the street after the burial he drew u p and personal ly submitted to the presi dent of the r epublic a violent telegram which the telegrapher refused to send then he enriched it with terms of singular aggressiveness pu t it in an envelope and mailed it as had happened with the death of his wi fe as had ha ppened to hi m so many ti mes during the war with the deaths of his best friends he did not have a feeling of sorrow but a blind and directionless rage a broad feeling of impotence he even accused father antoni o isabel of complicity for having marked his sons with indelible ashes so that theycould be identified by their enemies th e decrepit pr iest who co uld no longer string ideas together an d who was b eginning to startle his parishioners with the wild interpretation s he gave from the pulpit appeared one afternoon at the house with the go blet in whi ch he h ad prepared th e ashes tha t wednesday an d he tried to anoint the whole family with them to show that they could be washed off with water but the horror of the misfortune had pen etrated so d eeply that not even fernanda would let him experiment on her and never again was a bu endía seen to kneel at the altar rail on ash wednes day colonel aureliano buendía did not recover his calm for a long time he abandoned the manufacture of little fishes ate with great difficulty and wandered all through the house as if walking in his sleep dragging his blanket and chew ing on his quiet rage at the end of three month s his hair was ashen his ol d waxed mu stache poured down besi de his colorless lips but on the o ther hand his eyes were on ce more the burning coals th at had s tartled those w ho had seen him born and that in other days had m ade chairs rock with a s imple glance in the fury of his torment he tried futilely to r ouse the o mens th at had guided h is youth along dangerous paths into the desolate wasteland of glory he was lost astra y in a strange house where nothing and no one now stirred in him the slightest vestige o f affection once he op ened melquíades’ room looking for the traces of a past from before the war and he found only rubble trash piles of waste accumulated over all the years of abandonment between the covers of the book s that no one had ever read again in the old parchments damaged by dampness a livid flower had prosper ed and in the air tha t had been the purest and brightest in th e house an u nbearable smell of rotten memories floated one morning he found úrsula weeping u nder the ch estnut tree at th e knees of her dead hus band colonel aureliano buendía was the only inhabitant of the house wh o still did not see the powerful old man who had been bea ten down by hal f a century i n the open a ir “say hello to your fath er” úrsula told him h e stopped for an instant in front of the chestnut tree and once again he saw that the empty space before him did not arouse an affection either “what does he say” he asked “he’s very sad” úrsula answered “because he think s that you’re going to die” “tell him” the colonel said smiling “that a pe rson doesn’t die when he should but when he can” the omen of the dead father stirred up the last re mnant of pride that was l eft in his heart but he confused it with a sudden gust of strength it was for that reason that he hounded úrsula to tell him where in the courtyard the gold coins that they had found inside the plaster saint joseph were buried “you’ll never know” she told him with a fi rmness inspired by an old lesson “o ne day” she added “the owner of that fortune wil l appear an d only he can dig it up” no one knew why a ma n who had always been so generous had begun to covet money with such anxiety and not the modest amounts tha t would have been enough to resolve a n emergency but a fortune of such mad size th at the mere mention of it left aureliano segundo aw ash in am azement his ol d fellow party memb ers to whom he went asking for help hid so as not to receive him it was around that time that h e was heard to say “the only difference today between li berals and conservatives is that th e liberals go to mass at five o’clock and the c onservatives at eight” nevertheless he insisted with such perseverance begged in such a way b roke his code of dignity to such a d egree that with a little h elp from here and a little more from there sneaking about everywhere with a slippery diligence and a pitiless perseverance he managed to put together in eight months more money than úrsula had buried then he visited the ailing colonel gerineld o márquez so that he would help him start the total war at a certain time colonel gerineldo márquez wa s really the only one who could have pulled even from hi s paralytics chair the mus ty strings of rebellion after the armis tice of n eerlandia while colonel aur eliano buendía took refuge with his little gold fishes he kep t in touch with the rebel officers who had been fa ithful to him until th e defeat with them he wa ged the sad war of daily humiliation of entreaties and petitions of co mebacktomorrow of anytimenow of we’re studyingyourcasewiththeproperattention the war hopelessly lost against the many yoursmost trulys who should have signed and would never sign the lifetime pensio ns the other war th e bloody one of twenty years did not cause them as much da mage as the corrosive war of eternal postponements even colonel gerineldo márquez w ho escaped three attempts on his life survived five wounds and emerged unscathed from innumerabl e battles succumbed to that atroci ous siege of waiting and sank into th e miserable defeat of ol d age thinking of amaranta among the diamond shaped patches of light in a bor rowed house the la st veterans of whom he had word had appeared photographed in a newspaper with their faces sha melessly raised beside an anonymous president of the republic who gave them buttons with his likeness on them to wear in their lapels and returned to them a flag soiled with blood and gunpowder so that they coul d place it on their coffins the others more honorable were still waiting for a letter in the shadow of public charity dying of hunger livin g through rage ratting of old age amid the exquisi te shit of glory so that when colonel aureliano buendía invited him to s tart a mortal conflagration that would wipe ou t all vestiges of a regime of corruption and scandal backed by the foreign inva der colonel gerineldo márquez could not hold back a shudder of compassion “oh aureliano” he sighed “i already knew tha t you were old but now i realize th at yo u’re a lot older than you look” chapter in th e bewilderme nt of her last years úrsula had had very little free time to attend to the papal education of josé arcadi o and the ti me cam e for him to get ready to leav e for the seminary right away mem e his sister dividing her time between fernanda’s rigidity and amaranta’s bitterness at almost the s ame moment reached the age set for her to be sent to the nuns’ school where they would make a virtuoso on the clavich ord of her úrsula felt tormented by grave doubts concerning the effectiveness of the methods with which she ha d molded the spirit of the languid apprentice supreme pontiff but she did not put the blame on he r staggering old age or the dark clouds that barely permi tted h er to make out th e shape of things but on something that she h erself could n ot really define and that sh e conceived confusedly as a progressive breakdown of time “the years nowadays do n’t pass the way th e old ones used to ” she would say feeling that everyd ay reality wa s slipping through her hands in the past she though t children took a long time to grow up all one had to do wa s remember all the time n eeded for jo sé arcadio the elder to go awa y with the gypsies and all that happened before he came back painted like a snake and talking like an astronomer and the things that happened in the house before am aranta a nd arca dio forgot the language of th e indians and learned span ish one had to see onl y the days of s un and d ew that po or josé arcad io buendía wen t through under the ches tnut tree an d all the tim e weeded to mourn his death before they brought in a dying colonel aureliano buendía who after so much war and so much suffering from it was still not fifty years of age in other times after sp ending the whole day making candy animals she had more th an enough ti me for the ch ildren to see from the whites of th eir eyes tha t they need ed a dose of castor oil now however when she had nothing to do and would go about with josé arcadio riding on her hip from dawn to d usk this bad kind of time compelled her to leave things half d one the truth was that úrsula resist ed growing old even when she had already los t count of her age and she was a bother on all sides as she tried to meddle in everything and as she annoyed stra ngers with her questions as to whether they had left a plaster saint joseph to be kept until the rains were over during the days of the war no one knew exactly when she had begun to lose her sight even in h er later years when sh e could no longer get out of bed it s eemed that she was simply defeated by decrepitud e but no on e discovered that sh e was blind she had noticed it before the birth of josé arcadio at first she th ought it was a matter of a passing debility and she secretly took marrow syrup and put honey on her eyes but quite soon she began to realize that she was irrevoca bly sinking into the darkness to a point where s he never ha d a clear no tion of the invention of the electric light for when they put in the first bulbs she was o nly able to p erceive th e glow she did not tell anyone about it because it would have been a pu blic recognition of her uselessness she concentr ated on a silent schoolin g in the distances of things and peoples voices so that she would still be able to see with her memo ry what the shadows of her cataracts no longer allowed her to later on she was to d iscover the un foreseen help of odors which wer e defined in the shadows with a strength that was much more c onvincing than that of bulk and color and which saved her finally from the shame of admitting defeat in the darkness of the room she was able to thread a needle and sew a buttonhole and she knew when the milk was about to boil she knew with so much certainty the location of everything that she herself forgot that she was blind at times on one occasion fernanda had the whole house u pset because she h ad los t her weddi ng ring and úrsula foun d it on a shelf in the children’s be droom quite simply while the oth ers were goin g carelessly all about she watched them with her four senses so that they never took her by surprise and after some time she discovered that every memb er of the family without realizing it repeated the same path every day the same actions and al most repeated the sam e words at the same hour only when they deviated from meticulous routine did they run the risk of losing something so when she heard fernanda all upset b e cause she had lost her ring úrsula remembered that th e onl y thing different that sh e had done tha t day was to put the m attresses out in the sun because meme had found a bedbug the might before since the child ren had been present at the fumigation úrsula figured that fernanda had put the ring in the on ly place where they could not reach it the shelf fernanda on the other hand looked for it in vain along the paths of her ev eryday itinerary without knowing that the search for lost things is hindered by routine habits and th at is why it i s so difficult to find them the rearing of josé arca dio helped ú rsula in the exhausting tas k of keeping herself up to date on the smallest changes in the house when she realized that am aranta was d ressing the saints in the bedroom she pretended to show the b oy the differences in the colors “let’s see” she would tell him “tell me what color the archa ngel raphael is wearing” in that wa y the child gave her the inf ormation tha t was denied her by her eyes and lon g before he went awa y to the seminary úrsula could already distinguish the different colors of the saints’ clothing by the texture sometimes unfores een accidents would happen one afternoon when amaranta was ‘embroidering on the porch with the begonias úrsula bumped into her “for heaven’s sake” amaranta protested “watch where you’re going” “it’s your fa ult” úrsula said “you’re not sitting where you’re supposed to” she was sure of it but th at day she began to rea lize something that no one had noticed and it was that with the passage of the year the sun imperceptibly changed position and those who sat on th e porch had to change their position little by little without being aware of it from then on úrsula had only to remember the date in order to know exa ctly where am aranta was si tting even though the trembling of her hands was more and more noticea ble and the weight of her feet was too much for her her small figure was never seen in so many places at the same time she was almost as diligent as when she ha d the whole weight of the house on her shoulders nevertheless in the impenetrable solitude of decrepitude s he had such clairvoyance as she exami ned the most insignificant happenings in the family that for the first time she saw clearl y the truths that her busy life in former times ha d prevented her from seeing around the time they were preparing josé arcadio for the seminary she had already made a detai led recapitul ation of life in the house since th e founding of macondo an d had completely changed the opinion that she had alwa ys held of her descendants she realized tha t colonel aureliano buend ía had not lost his love for th e family because he h ad been hard ened by th e war as she had thought before but that he had ne ver loved anyone not even his wife remedios or the coun tless onenight women who had passed th rough his life and much less his sons she sensed that he had fought so many wars not out of idealism as everyone had thought nor had he renounced a certain victory because of fatigue as everyone had thought but that he had won and lost for the same reason pure and sinful pride she reached th e conclusion that th e son for whom she would h ave given he r life was simply a man in capable of love one night when she was carrying him in her belly she hear d him weepi ng it was suc h a definite lament tha t josé arcad io buendía woke up b eside her and was happ y with the idea th at his son was going to be a ventril oquist other people predicted that he would be a prophet she on the other hand shuddered from t he certainty that the d eep moan was a first indica tion of the fearful pig tail and she begged god to let the child die in her womb but the lucidity of her old age allowed her to see and she said so many times tha t the cries of children in their mothers’ wombs are not announcements of ventriloquism or a faculty for prophecy but an un mistakable sign of an inca pacity for lo ve the lowering of the image of her son brought out in her all at once all the compassi on that she o wed him amaranta ho wever whose hardness of heart frightened her whose concen trated bitterness made her bitter suddenly becam e clear to h er in the final an alysis as the most ten der woman wh o had ever exis ted and sh e understood with pitying clarity that the unjust tortures to which she had submitted pietro crespi had not been dictated b y a desire for vengeance a s everyone had thought nor had the slow martyrdom with which she h ad frustrated the life of c olonel gerineldo márquez been determined by th e gall of her bitterness as everyone had thought but that bot h actions had been a mortal struggle between a measureless love and an invincible cowardice and that the irrational fear that amaranta had always had of her own tormented heart ha d triumphed in the end it was during that time that úrsula began to speak rebeca’s name bringing back the me mory of her with an old love that was exalted by tardy repentance and a sudden ad miration coming to und erstand th at only she r ebeca th e one who had never fed of her milk but only of the eart h of the land and the whiteness of the walls the one who did not carry the blood of her veins in he rs but the u nknown blood of the str angers whos e bones were still clocing in their grave rebeca th e one with an impatient heart th e one with a fierce womb was the only one who bad the unbridled co urage that úrsula had wanted for her line “rebeca” she would say feeling along the walls “how unfair we’ve been to you” in the house they simply thought that her mind wa s wandering especially si nce the time she had begun walking about with her right arm raised like the archangel gab riel fernanda however realized that there was a sun of clairvoyance in th e shadows of t hat wand ering for úrsula could say without hesi tation how much m oney had been spent in the house d uring the previous year amaranta had a similar idea one d ay as her mother was stirring a pot of sou p in the kitchen and said all at once without knowing that they were listening to her that the corn grinder they had bought from the first gypsies and that had dis appeared du ring the time before josé arcadio had taken hi s sixtyfive trips around the world was still in pilar ternera’s house also almost a hundred years old but fit and a gile in spite of her inconceivable fatn ess which frightened children as her laughter had frightened the doves in other times pi lar terner a was not surprised that úrsula was correct b ecaus e her own experience was beginning to tell her that an alert old age can be mor e keen than the cards nevertheless when úrsula realized tha t she had not had enough time to cons olidate the v ocation of josé arcadio she let herself be dist urbed by c onsternation she began to make mistakes trying to see with h er eyes the thi ngs that intu ition allowed her to see with greater clarity one morning she poured the contents of an inkwell over the boy’s head thinking that it was rose water she stumbled so much in her insistence in taking part in everything that she felt herself upset by gusts of ba d humor and she tried to get rid of the shadows th at were begi nning to wrap her in a straitjacket of cobwebs it was then that it occur red to her that her clumsiness was not the first victory of decrepitude and darkness but a sen tence passed b y time she th ought that p reviously when god did not make th e same traps out of the months and years that th e turks used when they measured a yard of percale things were different now ch ildren not only grew faster but even feelings developed in a different way no sooner had reme dios the beauty ascended to heaven in body an d soul than th e inconsiderate fernanda was going about mumbl ing to herself because her sheets had been carried off the bodies of the aurelianos were no soo ner cold in their graves than aurelian o segundo had the house lighted up a gain filled wi th drunkards playing t he accordion and dousing themselves i n champagn e as if dogs and not chris tians had died and as if that madhou se which had cost her so many headaches and so many candy animals was destined to become a tr ash heap of perdition remembering those thing s as she prepar ed josé arcadio’s trunk úrsula wondered if it was not preferable to lie down once a nd for all in her grave and let them throw the ear th over her and she asked god without fear if h e really believe d that people were made of iron in order to bear so many troubles and mortifications and asking over and over she was stirring up her ow n confusion and she felt irrepressible desires to let herself go and scamper about like a foreigner and allow herself at l ast an instant of rebellion that instant yearned f or so many ti mes and so many times postponed putting her r esignation as ide and shitti ng on everything once and for all and drawing out of her heart the infinite stacks of bad words that she had been forced to swallow over a century of conformity “shit” she shouted amaranta who was s tarting to put the clothes into the trunk th ought that s he had b een bitten b y a scorpion “where is it” she asked in alarm “what” “the bug” amaranta said úrsula put a finger on her heart “here” she said on thursday at two in the afterno on josé arcadio left for the seminary ‘úrsula would remember him always as she said goodbye to him languid and serious wit hout shedding a tear as she had taught him swel tering in the heat in the green corduroy suit with copper buttons and a starched bo w around his neck he l eft the dinin g room impregnated with the pen etrating fragrance of rose water that she had sprinkled on his head so that she could follow his tracks through the house while the farewell lunch was going on t he family co

wi th silver corners it was as if they ha d taken a coffin out of the house the only one wh o refused to take part in the farewell was colonel aureliano buendía “that’s all we need” he muttered “a pope” three months later aureliano segundo and fernanda took meme to sch ool and cam e back with a clavichord which took the place of the pianola it was around that time that amara nta started sewing her own shroud the banana fever had cal med down the ol d inhabitants of m acondo found themselves s urrounded by newcom ers and working hard to cling to their precarious resources of times gone by but com forted in any case by th e sense that they had survived a shipwreck in the house they still had guests for lunch and the old routine was never really set up again until the banana com pany left yea rs later nevertheless ther e were radical changes in the traditio nal sense of hospitality b ecause a t that time it was fernanda wh o imposed h er rules with úrsula relegated to th e shadows an d with ama ranta absorb ed in th e work of her winding cloth the form er apprentic e queen had the freedom to choose the guests and impose on them the rigid norms that her parents had taught her her sever ity made the house a red oubt of old customs in a town convulsed by the vulgarity with which the outsiders squandered thei r easy fortunes for her with no further questions asked proper

first days he gave up his stupendous fighting cocks again and took a job as foreman with the banan a company “he won’t ever come into this house again” fernan da said “a s long as he carries the ra sh of the foreign ers” such was the narrowness imposed in the house tha t aureliano segundo felt more comfortable a t petra cotes’ s first with the pre text of taking the burden off his wife he transferred his parties then with the pretext that the animals were l osing their fertility he tr ansferred his barns an d stables finally with the pretext tha t it was cool er in his concu bine’s house he transferred the sm all office in which he handl ed his business when fe rnanda realized tha t she was a widow whose husband had still not died it was already too late for things to return to their former state aureliano segundo barely ate at home and the only appearances he put in such as to sleep with h is wife wer e not enough to convince anyone one night out of carelessness morning found him in petra cotes’s bed fernanda contrary to expecta tions did not repr oach him in the least or give the slightest sigh of resentment but on the same day she sent two trunks with his clothing to the house of his concubine she sent them in broad daylight and wi th instructions that th ey be carried through the middle of the street so that everyone could see th em thinking that her straying husband would be unable to bear the shame and would return to the fold with his head hung low but that heroi c gesture was just one more proof of how poorly fernanda knew not onl y the character of her husband but the character of a community that had nothing to do with that of her parents for everyone wh o saw th e trunks pass by said tha t it was the n atural culmination of a story whos e intimacies were known to everyone and aurelian o segundo celebrated the freedom he had received with a party that lasted for three days to the gr eater disadvantage of his wife as she was entering into a sad m aturity with her somber long dresses her oldfashioned med als and her outofplace pride the concubine seemed to be b ursting with a second you th clothed in gaudy dresses of natural silk and with her eyes tigerstriped with a glow of vindication aureliano se gundo gave himself over to her again with the fury of adolescen ce as befo re when petra cotes had n ot loved him for himself but because she had him mixed up with his twin brother and as she slept with both of them at th e same time s he thought that god had given her th e good fortune of having a man who could make love like two the restored passion was so pressing that on more than on e occasion they would look each other i n the eyes a s they were getting read y to eat and without sayi ng anything they would cover their p lates and go into the bed room dying of hunger and of love inspired by th e things h e had seen on his furtive visits to the french ma trons aureliano segundo bought petra cotes a bed with an archiepiscopal canopy put velvet curtains on the wind ows and covered the cei ling and the walls of the bedroom with large rockcrystal mirro rs at the sa me time h e was more of a carouser and spendth rift than ever on th e trai n which arri ved every da y at eleven o’clock he would receive cases and more cases of champagne and brandy on the way back from the station he would drag the improvised cumbiamba along in full view of all the peop le on the way natives or outsiders acquaintances or people yet to be kn own withou t distinctions of any kind even the s lippery mr brown who talked only in a strange tongue let himself be seduced b y the tempting signs that aureliano segundo made him and s everal times he got dead drunk in petra cotes’s h ouse and h e even made the fierce german shepherd dogs that went everywhere with him dance to some texas songs that he himself mumbled in one way or a nother to the a ccompanimen t of the acco rdion “cease cows” aureliano segundo shouted a t the height of the party “cease becau se life is short” he never looked better nor had he been loved more nor had the breed ing of his animals been wilder there was a slaug htering of so many cows pigs and chickens for the endless p arties tha t the ground in the courtyard turned black and muddy with so mu ch blood it was an etern al execution ground of bones and innards a mud pit of left overs and they had to keep exploding dynamite bombs all the time so that the buzza rds would not pluck out the guests’ eyes aurelia no segundo grew fat purplecolored turtleshaped because of an appetite comparab le only to that of josé arcadio wh en he cam e back from traveling arou nd the world the prestige of his outlandish voracity of his immense capacity as a spendthrift of his unprecedented hospitality wen t beyond th e borders of the swamp a nd attracted the bestqual ified gluttons from all along the coas t fabulous eaters arrived from everywhere to take part in th e irrational tourneys of capacity and resistance tha t were organized in the ho use of petra cotes aureliano segundo was the un conquered eater until th e luckless saturday when camila sagastume appeared a totemic female known all through the land by the good na me of “the elephant” t he duel la sted until dawn on tuesday during the first twenty four hours having dispatched a dinner of veal with cassava yams and fried b ananas and a case and a half of c hampagne in addition aureliano segundo was sure of victory he seemed more enthusiastic more vital th an his imper turbable adversary who possessed a style th at wa s obviously more profes sional but a t the same time less emotional for t he large cro wd that fille d the house while aureliano segundo ate with great bites overcome by th e anxiety of victory the e lephant was slicing her meat with the art of a surgeon and eati ng it unhurriedly and ev en with a certain pleasure she was gigantic and sturdy but over her colossal form a tenderness of femininity prevailed and she had a face that was so beautiful hands so fine an d well cared for and such an irresistible personal charm that when aureliano segundo saw her enter the house he commen ted in a low voice that he would have preferred to have the tou rney in bed and not at the table later on when he saw her consume a side of veal without br eaking a sing le rule of good table manners he commented seriously that that delicate fascinating and insa tiable proboscidian was in a certain way the ideal woman he was not mistaken the reputation of a bone crusher that had preceded the elephant had no basis she was not a beef cruncher or a bear ded lady from a greek circus as ha d been said but the director of a school of voice she had le arned to ea t when she was already th e respectable mother of a family looking for a way for her childre n to eat b etter and not by means of any artificial stimulation of their app etites bu t through the a bsolute tran quility of th eir spirits her theory demonstrated in practice was based on the princi ple that a pers on who had all matters of conscience in perfect sh ape should b e able to eat until overco me by fa tigue and it wa s for moral reasons and sporting interest that she left her school and her home to co mpete with a man whos e fame as a great unprincipled eater had spread throughout the country from the first moment s he saw him she saw that aureliano segundo would lose not his st omach but his character at the end of the first night while the elepha nt was boldly going on aureliano segundo was wearing himself out with a great deal of talking and laughing they slept four hours on awakening each one had the juice of forty oranges eight quarts of coffee and thirty ra w eggs on the second mo rning after many hours without sleep and having put away two pigs a bunc h of bananas and four cases of champagne the elephant suspected that aureliano segundo had unknow ingly discovered the same method as hers but by the absurd route of total irres ponsibility he was ther efore more dangerous than she had thought nevertheless when petra cotes brought two roast turkeys to the table aureliano segundo was a step away from being stuffed “if you can’t don’t eat an y more” the elephant s aid to him “let’s call it a tie” she said it fr om her heart understan ding that she could not eat ano ther m outhful either out of remorse for bringing on the dea th of her adversary but aureli ano segundo interpreted it as a nother challenge and he filled h imself with turkey beyond hi s incredible capacity he lost consciousness he fell face do wn into the plate filled with bones frot hing at t he mouth like a dog and drowning in moans of agony he felt in the midst of the darkne ss that th ey were throwi ng him from the top of a tower into a bottomless pit and in a last flash of consciousnes s he re alized that at the end of tha t endless fall death was wai ting for him “take me to fernanda” h e managed to say his friends left him at the house thinking that they had helped him fulfill h is promise to his wife not to die in his concubi ne’s bed petra cotes had shined his patent leather boots that he wanted to wear in his coffin and she was already looking for someone to take them when they ca me to tell her that aureliano segundo was ou t of danger he did recover indeed in less than a week and two weeks later he was celeb rating the fact of his surviv al with unprecedented festivities he continued living at petra cotes’s bu t he would visit fernanda every da y and sometimes he would stay to eat with th e fam ily as if fate had reversed the situat ion and had made him the husband of hi s concubine and the lover of his wife it was a rest for fernanda during the boredom of her abando nment h er only distractio ns wer e the clavichord lessons at siesta time a nd the letter s from her children in the detailed messages tha t she sent them every two weeks there was not a si ngle line of truth she hid her troubles from them she hid from them the sa dness of a house which in spite of the light on the begonias in spite of the heaviness at two in the afternoon in spite of the fr equent waves of festivals that came in from the street was m ore and mor e like the co lonial mansi on of her pa rents fernanda would wander alon e among the three living ghosts and the dead ghos t of josé arcadio buendía who at times would come to sit down with an inquisitive attention in the h alflight of the parl or while she was pla ying the clav ichord colonel aureliano buendía was a s hadow since the last ti me that he had gone out into the street to propos e a war without any future to colonel geri neldo márquez he left the workshop only to urinate under the chestnut tree he did not receive any visits except that of the barber every three weeks he fed on anything that úrsula brought him once a day and even thoug h he kept on making little gold fishes with the sa me passion as before he stopped selling them when he found out that people were buying them not as pi eces of jewelry but as historic relics he made a bonfire in the courtyard of the dolls of remedios which had decorated their bedroom since their wedding the watchful úrsula realized what her so n was doing but she coul d not stop hi m “you have a heart of stone” she told him “it’s not a question of a heart” he said “the room’s getting full of moths” amaranta was weaving her shroud fernanda did not understa nd why she would write occasional letters to meme and even send her gifts and on th e other hand did not even want to hea r about josé arcadio “they’ll die without knowing why” amaranta ans wered when she was asked through úrsula and that answer planted an enigma in fe rnanda’s hea rt that she was never a ble to clarify tall broadshouldered proud always dressed in abundant petticoats with the lace an d in air of distinction that resisted the years and bad memories amaranta seemed to carry the cross of ashes of virginity on her forehead in reality she carried it on her hand in the black bandage which she did not take off even to sleep and which she washed and ironed herself her life was spent in weaving her shroud it might have been said th at she wove during the day and unwo ve during the night and not with any hope of defeating solitude in that way but quite the contrary in order to nurture it the greatest worry that fernanda had during her years of abandonment was that meme would come to spend her first vacation and not find au reliano segundo at home his congestion had pu t an end to that fear when meme returned her parents had ma de an agreement that no t only would the girl think that aureliano segundo was still a do mesticated husband but also that she would not notice the sa dness of the house every year for two months aureliano segundo played his role of an exemplary husband and he organized parties with ice cream and cookies which the g ay and lively schoolgirl enhanced with the clavichord it was obvious from then on that she had inherited very little of her mother’s cha racter she seemed more of a second version of amaranta when the latter had not kno wn bitternes s and was ar ousing the h ouse with her dance step s at the age of twelve or fourteen before her secr et passion f or pietro crespi was to twist th e direction of her heart in th e end but unlike amaranta unlike all of them meme still did not reveal the solitary fate of the family and she seemed entirely in conformity with the worl d even when she would shut herself up in the parlor at two in the afternoon to practice the clavic hord with an inflexible discipline it was obvious that she liked the house that she spent the whol e year dreami ng about the excitemen t of the young people her arrival brought around and that she wa s not far removed from the festive v ocation and hospitable excesses of her father the first sign of that calami tous inherita nce was revealed on her third vacation when meme appeared at the hous e with four nuns and sixtyeight classmates who m she had invited to spend a week wi th her family on her own initiative an d without a ny previous warning “how awful” fernanda lamented “t his child is as much of a barbarian as her father” it was neces sary to borrow beds and hammocks from the neighbors to set up nine shifts at the table to fix hours for bathing and to borrow forty stools so that th e girls in blue uniforms with masculine buttons would not spend the whole day ru nning from one place to another the visit was a failure because the nois y schoolgirls would scarcely finish bre akfast before they had to start taking turns for lunch and then for dinner and for the whole week th ey were abl e to take only one walk through the plantations at nightfall the nuns were exhausted unable to move give another order and still the troop of tireless adolescents was in th e courtyard singing school songs out of tune one day they were on the poi nt of trampli ng úrsula who made an effort to be useful precisely where sh e was most in the way on another day the nuns got all excited because colonel aureliano buendía had urinated under the chestnut tree without being concer ned that the schoolgirls were in the courtyard amaranta was on th e poi nt of causin g panic because one of th e nuns went into the kitchen as she was salting the soup and the only thing that occurred to her to say was to ask wha t those handfuls of white powder were “arsenic” amaranta ans wered the night of their arrival the students carried on in such a way trying to go to the b athroom before they went to bed that at one o’clock in the morning the last ones were still goin g in fernanda then bought seventytwo chamberpots but she only managed to change the nocturnal problem into a morning o ne becaus e from dawn o n there was a long line o f girls each with her po t in her hand waiting for her turn to wash it altho ugh some of th em suffered fevers and several of them were in fected by mo squito bites most of them showed an unbreakable resistance as they faced the most tro ublesome difficulties and even at the time of th e greatest heat they would scamper through the garden when they finally left the flo wers were destroyed the furniture broken and the walls covered with drawings and writing but fern anda pardoned them for all of the damage becaus e of her relief at th eir leaving she retu rned the borrowed beds and stools and kept the seventytwo chamberpots in melquíades’ room the locked ro om about which the spiritual life of the hous e revolved in former times was known from that time on as the “chamberpot room” for colonel aureliano b uendía it wa s the most a ppropriate n ame becaus e while the r est of th e family was s till amazed by the fact that melquíades’ room was i mmu ne to dust and destruction he s aw it turned into a dunghill in any c ase it did n ot seem to bother him who was correct and if he found out about the fate of the room it was because fernanda kept passing by and disturbing his work for a whole afternoon as she put away the chamberpots during those days josé arcadio segundo rea ppeared in the house he went along the porch without greeting anyone and he shu t himself up in the workshop to ta lk to the colonel in spite of the fact th at she could n ot see him úrsula analyz ed the clicking of his foreman’s boots and was surprised at the unbridgeable distance that sep arated him from the family even from the twi n brother with whom he had played ingenious games of confusion in childhood and with whom he no longer had a ny traits in common he was linear solemn and had a pensiv e air and the sadness of a saracen and a mournful glow on his face that wa s the color of autumn he was the on e who most resembled his mother santa sofía de la piedad úr sula reproached herself for the habit of forgetting about him when she sp oke about the family b ut when sh e sensed him in the hous e again an d noticed that the colonel let him into the works hop during working hours she reexamined her old memories and confirmed the belief that at some moment in childhood he had changed places with his twin brother because it was he and not the other one who should have been called aureliano no one knew the details of his life at one time it was discov ered that he had no fixed abode th at he raised fighting cocks a t pilar ternera’s house an d that so metimes he would stay there to sleep but that he almo st always spent the night in the rooms of the french matrons he drifted about with no ties of affection with no a mbitions like a wanderin g star in úrsula’s planetary system in reality josé arcadio segundo was not a member of the fa mily nor would he ever be of any other since that distant d awn when colonel geri neldo márquez took him to the barracks not so that he coul d see an execution but so that for th e rest of his life he would never forget the sad and somewhat m ocking smile of the man being shot th at was not only his oldest memory but the onl y one he had of his childhood the other one that of an old man with an oldfashioned vest and a ha t with a brim like a crow’s wings who told him marvelous things framed in a dazzling window he wa s unable to pl ace in any p eriod it was an uncertai n memory entirely devoid of lessons or nostalgia the opposite of the memory of the executed man which had really set the direction of his life and would return to his memory clearer and dearer as he grew older as if the passage of time wer e bringing him closer to it úrsula tried to use josé arcadi o segundo to get colonel aureliano buendía to give up his imprisonment “get him to go to the movies” she said to him “even if he doesn’t like the picture a s least he’ll b reathe a little fresh air” but it did not take her lon g to realize that he was a s insensible to her begging as the colo nel would ha ve been and that th ey were armored by the same impermeability of affection although she never knew nor did anyone know what they spoke about in their prolonged sessions shut up in the workshop she understood that they wer e probably the only members of the family who seem ed drawn together by som e affinity the truth is that not even josé arcadio segundo wo uld have been able to draw the colonel out of his confinement the inv asion of schoolgirls had lo wered th e limits of his p atience with the pretext that his wed ding bedroom was at the mercy of th e moths in s pite of the d estruction of remedios’ appetizing d olls he hung a hammock in the workshop and then he woul d leave it only to go into th e courtyard to take care of his necessities úrsula was unab le to string together even a trivial conversation with him she knew th at he did not l ook at the di shes of food but would p ut them at one end of his workbench while h e finished a littl e fish and i t did not ma tter to him i f the soup curdled or if the meat go t cold he grew harder a nd harder ever since colonel gerineldo márquez refused to back him up in a senile war he locked himself up inside himself and the family finally thought of him is if he were dead no other hu man reactio n was seen in him until one octo ber eleventh when he went to the street door to watch a circus parade for colonel aureliano buendía it had been a day just like all those of his last yea rs at five o’clock in the morning the noise of the toads and cri ckets outside the wall wo ke him up the drizzle ha d persisted since saturday and there was no necessity for him to hear their tiny whisperi ng among the leaves of the garden because he would have f elt the cold i n his bones i n any case he was as always wrapped in his woolen blanket and wearing his crude cotton long dr awers which he still wore for co mfort even though because of their musty oldfashioned style he ca lled them his “goth drawers” he put on his tight pants bu t did not button them up nor did he put the gold button into his shirt collar as he always did becaus e he planned to take a bath then he put the blank et over his head like a cowl brushed his dripping mustache with his fingers and went to urinate in the courtyard there was still so much time left for the sun to come out that josé ar cadio buendía was still dozing under the shelter of palm f ronds that had been rotted b y the rain he did not see him as he had n ever seen hi m nor did he hear th e incomprehensible phrase that the gh ost of his father addressed to him as he awakened startled by the stream of hot urine that splattered his shoes he put the bath off for later not because of the cold and th e dampn ess but b ecaus e of the op pressive october mist on his way back to th e workshop he noticed the odor of the wick that santa sofía de l a piedad was using to light the stoves and he waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil so that he co uld take along his mug without sugar santa sofía de la piedad asked him as on every morning what day of the week it was and h e answered th at it was tu esday octo ber eleventh watching the glow of the fire as it gilded the persistent woman who neither then nor in any instant of her life seemed to exist completely h e suddenly remembered that on one october elev enth in the middle of the war he had awakened with the brutal certainty that the woman with whom he had slept was dead she really was and he could not forget the date beca use she had asked him an hour before what da y it was in spite of the memory he did not have an awarenes s this time either of to what degree his omens had abandoned him and while the coffee was boiling he kept on th inking out of pure curiosity but without the slightest risk of nostalgia about the woman whos e name he had never known and whose face he had not seen because she h ad stumbled to his hammock in the dark nevertheles s in the emp tiness of so many women who came into his life in the same way he did not remem ber that she was the one who in the delirium of that first meeting was on the point of foundering in her own tears an d scarcely an hour before her death had sworn to love him until she died he did not think about her again or about any of the others after he went in to the workshop with the steaming cup and he lighted the l amp in order to count the little gold fishes which he kept in a tin p ail there were seventeen of them since he had d ecided not to s ell any he k ept on m aking two fishes a day an d when he fin ished twentyfive he would melt them down an d start all o ver again he worked all morning absorbed without thinking about anyth ing without realizing that at ten o’clock the rai n had grown stronger and someone ran past the wo rkshop shouting to close the doors before the house was flooded and without thin king even ab out himself until úrsula came in with his lunch an d turned out the light “what a rain” úrsu la said “october” he said when he sai d it he did not raise his eyes from the first little fish of the day because he was putting in the rubies for the eyes only when h e finished it and put it wi th the o thers in the pail di d he begin to drink the soup then very slowly he ate th e piece of meat roasted with onions the white rice and the slices of fried bananas all on the s ame plate together his appetite did not ch ange under either the b est or the h arshest of circumstances after lunch he felt the drowsiness of inactivity because of a kind of scientific superstition he nev er worked o r read or ba thed or mad e love until two hours of digestion had gone by and it was su ch a deeprooted belief that several times he held up military operations so as not to submit the troops to the risks of indigestion so he lay down in the hammo ck removing the wax from his ears with a penknife and in a few minutes h e was asleep he dreamed that he was going into an empty hou se with white walls and that he was u pset by th e burden of being the first human being to en ter it in the dream he rememb ered that he h ad dreamed the same thi ng the night before and on many nights over the past years and he knew that the image would be erased from his memory wh en he awaken ed because that recurren t dream had the quality of not being remembered except within the drea m itself a moment later indeed when the barb er knocked at the workshop door colonel aureliano bue ndía awo ke with the i mpression that he ha d fallen asleep involun tarily for a few seconds and that he had not had time to dream anythi ng “not today” he told the barb er “we’ll make it on friday” he had a th reeday beard speckled with white h airs but he did not think it necessary to shave because on friday he was going to have his hair cu t and it could all be done at the same time the sticky swea t of the unwa nted siesta aroused the scars of the sores in his armpits the s ky had cleared but the sun had not come out colonel aureliano buendía released a sonorous belch which brought back the a cidity of the so up to his palate and wh ich was like a command from his organism to throw his blanket over his shoulders and go to the toil et he stayed there longer than was necessary crouched ov er the d ense fermentation that was co ming out of the wood en box until habit told him that it was time to start work again during the time he lingered he rem embered agai n that it was tuesday and that josé arcadio segundo had not co me to the workshop because it was payday on the banan a company farms that recollection as all of those of the past few years led him to thin k about th e war without h is realizing it he reme mbered that colonel gerineldo márquez had on ce promised to get him a horse with a white star on its face and that he had never spoken about it again then he went on toward scattered episodes but he brou ght them ba ck without a ny judgment because since he could not think about anythi ng else he had learned to think coldly so that inescapable memories would not tou ch any feeling on his way back to the workshop seeing that the air was beginning to dry out he decided that it was a good time to take a bath but amaranta ha d got there ahead of him so he started on the second little fish of the day he was putti ng a hook on the tail when the sun cam e out with such strength that the light creaked like a fishing boat the air which had been washed by the threeday drizzle was filled with flying ants then he came to the realization that he felt like urinat ing and he had been putting it off until he had finished fixing the little fish he went ou t into the courtyard at ten minutes after f our when h e heard th e distant brass instruments the beating of the bass drum and the shouting of the children and for the first time since his youth he knowingly fell int o a trap of nostalgia and relived that prodigious afternoon of the gypsies when his father took hi m to s ee ice santa sofía de la piedad dropped what she was doing in the kitchen and r an to the do or “it’s the circus” she shouted instead of going to the chestnut tree colonel au reliano buend ía also wen t to the street door and mingled with the bystand ers who were watching the parade he saw a wom an dressed in gold sitting on the head of an elephant he s aw a sad dromed ary he s aw a b ear dr essed like a dutch girl keeping time to the musi c with a sou p spoon and a pan he s aw the clowns doing cartwheels at th e end of the p arade and o nce more he saw the fa ce of his miserable solitude when ev erything had passed by an d there was nothing but the bright expa nse of the street and the air full of flying ants with a few onlookers peering into the precipice of uncertainty then he went to the chestnut tree thinking about the circus and while h e urinated he tried to keep on thinking about the circus but he could no longer find the memory he pulled his head in between his shoulders like a baby chick and remained m otionless with his forehead against th e trunk of the chestnu t tree the fa mily did not find him until the following day at eleven o’clock in the mornin g when santa sofía de la piedad went to throw out the garbage in back and her atten tion was attra cted by the des cending vultures chapter meme’s last vaca tions coincided with the period of mourning for colonel aureliano buendía the shuttered house was no place for parties they spoke in whispers ate in silence recited the rosary three times a d ay and even clavichord practice during the hea t of siesta tim e had a funereal echo in spite of her secr et hostility toward the co lonel it was fernanda who imposed the rigor of that mourni ng impressed by the solemnity with which the government exalted the m emory of its dead enemy aureliano segundo as was his custom came b ack to sleep i n the house during his daughter’s vacation and fernanda must have done some thing to regain her privileges as his legitimate wi fe because the following year meme found a newborn little sister who against the wishes of her mother had been bapti zed with the n ame am aranta úrsula meme had fi nished her course of study the dipl oma tha t certified her as a concert cla vichordist was ratified by the virtuosity with whi ch she ex ecuted popular melodies of the seventeenth centur y at the gather ing organized to celebrate the compl etion of her studies and with which the period of mourning came to in end more than her art the guests admired her duality her frivolous and even slightly infantile character did not seem up to any serious activity but when she sat down at the clavichord she became a different girl one whose un foreseen maturity gave her the air of an adult that was ho w she had always been she really did am have any definite vocation but she had earned the highest grades by means of inflexible discip line simply in order not to annoy her mother they could have imposed on her an apprenticeship in any other field and the results would have been th e same since she had been very sma ll she had been troubled by fernan da’s strictness her custom of deciding in favor of extremes and she would have been capa ble of a much more difficult sacrifice than the clavichord lessons merely not to run u p against her intransigence during the graduation ceremonies she had the impression that the parchmen t with gothic letters and illuminated capitals was freeing her from a compromise that she had accepted not so much out of obedience as out of convenience and she tho ught that from then on n ot even the insistent fer nanda would worry an y more about an instrument that even the nuns looked upon as a museum fossil during t he first years she thought that her calculations were mistaken beca use after she had put half the town to sleep not only in the parlor but also at all charitable fu nctions school ceremonies and patriotic celebrations that took place in ma condo her mother still invited to the house every newcomer whom she thought capable of appre ciating her daughter’s virt ues only after the death of amaranta when the family shut itself up again in a period of mourni ng was meme able to lock the clav ichord and forget the key in some dresser drawer without fernanda’s being annoyed on finding out when and through whose fault it had been l ost meme b ore up under the exhibitions with the same stoicis m that sh e had dedicated to her apprenticeship it was the pri ce of her freedom fernanda was so pleased with her docility and so proud of the admir ation that her art inspired that she was never agains t the house being fall of girl friends her spending the after noon in the groves and going to the movies with aureliano segundo or some muted lady as long as the film was approved by father antonio isabel from the pulpit during those moments of relaxation meme’s real tastes were revealed her happiness la y at th e oth er extreme from discipline in noisy parties in gossip about lovers in prolonged sessions with her girl friends wher e they learned to smoke and talked about male business and where they once got th eir hands on some cane l iquor and ended up naked measuring and compari ng the parts of their bodies meme would never forget that night when she arrived home chewing licorice lozenges an d without n oticing their consternati on sat down at th e tabl e where ferna nda and am aranta were eating dinner without sa ying a word to each o ther she had spent two tremendous h ours in the bedroom of a gi rl friend weeping with laughter a nd fear and beyond an crises she ha d found the rare feeling of bravery that sh e needed in order to run a way from school and tell her mother in one way or a nother that she could use the clavichord as an enema sittin g at the hea d of the table drinking a chicken broth that landed in her stomach like an elixir of resurrection meme then s aw fernanda an d amaran ta wrapped i n an accus atory halo of reality she had to make a great effort not to thro w at them their prissiness their poverty of spirit their delusions of grandeur from the time of he r second vacation she had known that her father was living at home only in order to keep up ap pearances an d knowing fernanda as she did and having arranged later to meet petra c otes she tho ught that her father was right she also would have preferred being the daug hter of the concubine in the h azines s of the al cohol meme thought with pleasure about the scand al that woul d have taken place if she were to express her thoughts at that moment an d the intimate satisfaction of her roguishness was s o intense tha t fernanda noticed it “what’s the matter” she asked “nothing” meme answered “i was only now discovering how much i loved you both” amaranta was startled b y the obviou s burden of hate th at the declaration carried but fernanda felt so moved that she thought she would go ma d when meme awoke at midnight with her head splitting with pain and dr owning in vomited gall she gave her a vial of castor oil put compresses on her stomach and ice cubes on her head and she made her stay in bed for five days and follow the diet ordered by the new and outlandish french do ctor who after examining her for more than two hours reached the foggy conclusion that she had an ailment p eculiar to women having lost her courage in a miserable state of demoralization me me had no other recourse but to bear up under it úrsula completely blind by then bu t still active and lucid was the only one who guessed the exact diagnosis “as far as i can see” she thought “t hat’s the sa me thing that happens to drunken people” but she not onl y rejected the idea she r eproached h erself for the frivolity of her thought aureliano segundo felt a twinge of conscience when he saw meme’s state of prostration and he promised himself to take better care of her in th e future that was how the relation ship of jolly comradeship was born between father and daughter which freed him for a time from the bitter solitude of his revels and freed her from fernanda ’s watchful eye without necessity of pr ovoking the domestic crisis that s eemed inevitable by th en at that time aureliano segundo postponed any appointments in order to be with meme to take he r to the movies or the circus and he spent the greater part of his idle ti me with her in r ecent times his an noyance with the absurd obesity that prevented hi m from tying his shoes and his abus ive satisfacti on with all manner of a ppetites h ad began to sour his character the discovery of his daughter restored his former joviality and th e pleasure of being with her was slowly leading him away from dissipation meme was entering a fruitful age she was not beauti ful a s amaranta had never been but on the other hand she was pleasant uncomplicated and she had the virtue of making a good impression on peopl e from the first momen t she had a modem spirit that woun ded the anti quated sobri ety and poor ly disguised miserly hear t of fernanda and tha t on the o ther hand aureliano segundo took pleasure in developing it was he who resolved to take her out of the bedroom she had occupied since childhood where the fearful eyes of the saints still fed her adol escent terrors and he furnished for her a room with a royal bed a large dressing tabl e and velvet curtains not realizing that he was producing a second version of petra cotes’s room he was s o lavish with meme th at he did no t even know how much money he gave her because sh e herself would take it out of his pockets and he kept abreast of every kind of new beauty a id that arrived in the commissary of the banana company m eme’s room became filled with pumice stone cushions to polish her nails with hair curlers toothbrushes drops to m ake her eyes la nguid and so many and such new cosmetics and artifacts of beauty tha t every time fernanda went i nto the room she was scandalized by the idea that her daughter’s dressing table must hav e been the same as those of the french ma trons nevertheless fernanda divided her time in those days between little amaranta úrsula who was mischievous and sickly and a touching correspondence with the invi sible physicians so that when she noticed the complicity b etween father and daughter the only pr omise she extracted from aureliano segundo was that h e woul d never take meme to petra cotes’s house it was a meaningl ess demand because the concubine was so annoyed with the comradeship between her lover and his daughter that she did not want an ything to do with her petra was to rmented b y an unknown fear as if instinct wer e telling her th at meme by just wanting it could su cceed in what fernanda had been unable to do deprive her of a love that by then she considered assured unti l death for the first time aureliano segundo had to tolerate the harsh expressions and th e violent tirades of his concubine and he was even afraid that his wand ering trunks would make the return journey to his wife’s house that did not happen no one kn ew a man better th an petra cotes k new her lover and she k new tha t the trunks would remain where they had been sent b ecause if aureliano segundo detested anything it was com plicating his life with modifications and changes so the trunks sta yed wh ere th ey were an d petra cotes set abou t reconquering the husband by sharpening the only weapons that his daughter could not us e on him i t too was an u nnecessary e ffort because meme h ad no desire to intervene in her father’s a ffairs and if she had it wo uld certain ly have been in favor of the concubine she had n o time to both er anybody she herself swept her room and made her bed as the nuns had taught her in the morning she took care of her clothes sewing on the porch or using amaranta’s old pedal machine w hile the others were taking their sies tas she would practice th e clavichord for two hours knowing tha t the daily s acrifice would keep fe rnanda calm for the sam e reason sh e continued giving concerts at church fairs and school parti es even though the req uests were l ess and less frequent at nightfall she would fi x herself up put on one of her simple dresses and her stiff high shoes and if she had nothing to do with her father she woul d go to the homes of her girl friends where she would stay until dinnertime it was ra re that aureli ano segundo would not call for her then to take her to the m ovies among meme’s friends there were three young am erican girls who broke through the electrified chicken fence barrier and made friends with girls from macondo one of th em was patri cia brown grateful for the hospital ity of aureli ano segund o mr brown opened the doors of his house to meme and invited her to the saturday dances which were the only ones where gringos and natives mingled when fernanda found out about it she forgot about amaranta úrsula and the invisible doctors for a momen t and becam e very melo dramat ic “just think” she said to mem e “what th e colonel must be thinking in his grave” she sought of course t he backing of úrsula but the blind old woman contrary to what ever yone expected saw nothing reproachabl e in meme’s going to the dances and making friends with american girls her own age as long as she kept her strict habits and was not co nverted to the protesta nt religion meme sensed the thou ght of her greatgreat grandmother very well and the day after the dances she would get up earlier than usual to go to mass ferna nda’s opposition lasted until the day when meme broke dow n her resista nce with the news that th e americans wanted to h ear her play the clavichord the instrument was taken out of the house ag ain and carried to mr br own’s wher e the young concert artist really did r eceive very sincere appla use and the most en thusiastic congra tulations from then on s he was invited not onl y to the dances but also to the sunday swim parties in the pool and to lunch once a week mem e learned to s wim like a professional t o play tennis and to eat virginia ham wi th slices of pineapple among dan ces swimmi ng and ten nis she soo n found herself getting involved in the english language aureliano segundo was s o enthusiasti c over the progress of his daughter that from a traveling salesman he bought a sixvolume english encyclopedia with many color prints which meme read in her spare time the reading occupied the attention that she had formerly given to gossip about sweethearts and th e experimental r etreats that she would g o through with her girl friends not because i t was imposed as discipline but because she had lost all interes t by th en in talking about mysteries that were in th e public do main she lo oked back o n the drunken episode as an infantile a dventure and it seemed so funny to her that she told aureliano segundo about it and he thought it was more am using than s he did “if yo ur mother only knew” he told h er doubling up with laughter as he always said when he told her something in confidence he had made her promise that she would let him kno w about h er first love affair with the same confidence a nd meme told h im that she l iked a redheaded american boy who had come to spend his vacation with his parents “what do you know” aureliano segu ndo said laughing “if your mother only knew” but meme al so told him that the boy had gone back to his cou ntry and had disappeared from sight the maturity of her judgment ensured peace in the family aureliano segundo then d evoted mor e time to petra cotes and a lthough his body and so ul no longer permitted hi m the debau ches of days gone by he lost no chance to arrange them and to dig out the accordion which by then had som e keys held in place by shoelaces at home am aranta was weaving her interminable s hroud and úrsula dragged about in her decrepitude through the dep ths of the shado ws where th e only thing that was still visib le was the ghost of josé arc adio buendía under the chestnut tree fernanda consolidated her authority her monthly letters to her son josé arcadio at that time did not carry a string of lies and she hid from him only her correspondence with the invisible doctors who had diagnosed a benign tumor in her large intestine and were prepa ring her for a telepathic o peration it might hav e been aid that pe ace and happiness reigned for a long time in the tired ma nsion of the buendías if it had not been for the sudden death of amaranta which caused a new uproar it was an unex pected event although she was old and isolated from everyone she still looked firm and upright and with the health of a rock that sh e had always had no one knew her thoughts since the afternoo n on which she had given colonel gerineldo márquez his final rejecti on and shut herself up to weep she was not seen to cry during the ascensi on to heaven of remedios the beauty or over the extermination of the aurelianos or the death of col onel aureliano buendía who was the person she l oved most i n this world although she showed it only when they found hi s body under the ch estnut tree she h elped pick u p the body she dressed him in his soldier’s uniform shaved him combed his hair and waxed his mustache better th an he had ever done in his days of glory no one thought that there was any love in that act because they were accustomed to the familiarity of amaranta with the rites of death fernanda wa s scandalized that she did not understand the relationship of catholicism with life but only its rela tionship with death a s if it were not a religion but a compendium of funeral conventions amaranta was too wrapped up in the eggplant patch of her memories to understand those subtle apologetics she had reached old age with all of her nostalgias intact when s he listened to the waltzes of pietro crespi she felt the same d esire to weep that she had had in adolescence as if time and har sh lessons had meant no thing the rolls of musi c that sh e hers elf had thro wn into the trash with the pretext that they h ad rotted from dam pness kept spinning and playing in her memory she had tried to sink them into th e swampy p assion that sh e allowed hers elf with her nephew aureliano josé a nd she tried to take refuge in th e calm and virile protection o f colonel gerineldo márquez but sh e had not been able to o vercome them not even with the mo st desperate act of her old age when she would bathe the small josé arcadio three years before he was sent to the seminary and caress hi m not as a grandmother would have done with a grandchild but as a wom an would have done with a man as it was said that the french matrons did and as she had wanted to do with pietro crespi at the age of twelve fourteen when she saw him in his dancing tights and with the magic wand with wh ich he kept time to th e metronome at times it pained her to have let that outpouring of misery follow its course and at times it made her so angry that she wou ld prick her fingers wi th the needles but what pained her most and enraged her most and made h er most bitter was the fragrant and wo rmy guava grove of love that was dragging her toward death just as colonel aureliano buendía t hought about his war unable to avoid it so amaranta thought about rebeca but while her br other had managed to sterilize his memories she had only managed to make hers more scalding the only thing that she asked of god for many years was that he would not visit on her the punishment of dying before rebeca every time s he passed by her house and noted the progress of destruction s he took com fort in the idea tha t god was listening to her one afternoon when she wa s sewing on the porch she was a ssailed by the certai nty that she would be sitting in that place in the sa me position and under th e same light when they b rought her the news of rebeca’s d eath she sa t down to wait for it as one waits for a letter and the fact was that at on e time she woul d pull off buttons to s ew them on again so that ina ctivity would not make the wait lon ger and more anxious no one in the house realized that a t that tim e amaranta was sewing a fine shroud for rebeca later on when aureliano triste told how he had s een her changed into an app arition with leathery skin and a fe w golden threa ds on her s kull amaranta was not surprised because the sp ecter d escribed was exactl y wha t she h ad been imagining for some tim e she had decided to restore rebeca’s corpse to disguise with paraffin the damage to her face and make a wig for her from the hair of the saints she woul d manufactu re a beautifu l corpse with the linen shroud and a plushlined coffin with purple trim and she would put it at the dispo sition of the worms with splendid funeral ceremon ies she worked out the plan with such hatred th at it made her tremble to think about the scheme which she would have carried out in exactly the s ame way if it had been do ne out of love but she would not allow herself to become u pset by the confusion and went on per fecting the details so minutely that s he came to be more tha n a specialist and was a virtuoso in the rites of death the only thing that she did not keep in mind in her fearsome plan wa s that in spite of her pleas to god she might die befo re rebeca that was in fact what h appened at the final moment however amara nta did not feel frustrated but on the contrar y free of all bitterness because death had awarded her the privilege of announcing itself several years ahead o f time she saw it on one burning afternoon sewing with her on the porch a short ti me after meme had left for school she saw it becaus e it was a woman dressed in blue with long hair w ith a sort of antiquated l ook and with a certain resemblance to pilar ternera during the time when she had helped with the chores in the kitchen fernanda was present several times and did not see her in spite of the fact tha t she was so real so human and on one occasion asked of amaranta the favor of thread ing a needle death did not tell her when she was going to die or wheth er her hour wa s assigned before that of r ebeca bu t ordered her to begin sewing her own shroud on the next sixth of april she was authorized to make it as complicated and as fine as she wanted but just as honestly executed as rebeca’s and she was told that she woul d die without pain fear or bitterness at dusk o n the day that she finished it trying to waste th e most time possible amaranta ordered some rough flax and spun the thread herself she did it so care fully that the work alone took four years then she started the s ewing as s he got closer to the una voidable end she began to understan d that only a miracle would allow her to prolong the work past rebeca’s dea th but the very concentr ation gave her the calm ness that she needed to accept the idea of frustration it was th en tha t she understood the vicious circle of colonel aureliano buendía’s little gold fishes the wo rld was reduced to the surface of her skin and her inner self was safe from all bitterness it pained her not to have had tha t revelation many years bef ore when it had still been possible to purify memories and reconstruct the universe under a new light and evok e without tr embling pietro crespi’s smell of lavender at dusk and rescue rebeca from her slough of misery not out of hatred or out of love but because of the measureless understanding of solitude the hatred that she noticed one night in memes words did not upset her because i t was directed at her but s he felt th e repetition of a nother adolescence tha t seemed as cl ean as hers must have s eemed and that howev er was alread y tainted with rancor but by then her acceptance o f her fate wa s so deep that she was not even upset by the certainty th at all possibilities of rectification were closed to her he r only objective was to finish the shroud instead of slowing it down with useless detail as she ha d done in the beginning she speeded up the work one week b efore she cal culated that she would ta ke the l ast stitch on the night of february and without revealing the motives she suggested to meme that s he move up a clavichord concert tha t she had arra nged for the day after bu t the girl paid no attentio n to her am aranta th en looked for a way to delay for fortyeight hours and she even t hought that death was giving her her way becaus e on the night of february fourth a storm cause d a break down at the power plant but on t he following day at eight in the mornin g she took th e last stitch in the mos t beautiful piece of work that an y wo man had ever finished and she anno unced witho ut the leas t bit of dramatics that sh e was going to die at dusk she not onl y told the fa mily but the whole town because amaranta had conceived of the idea th at she could m ake up for a life of meanness with on e last favor to the world and she thou ght that no o ne was in a b etter positio n to take letters to the dead the news that amaranta buendía was sailing at dusk carrying the m ail of death spread throughout macondo before noon and at three i n the afternoon there was a whole carton full of letters in the parlor those who did not want to write gave amaranta ver bal messages which she wrote down in a noteboo k with the na me and date of death of the recipient “don’t worry” she told the senders “the first thing i’ll do when i get ther e is to ask for him and give him your message” it was farcical amaranta di d not show any upset or the slightest sign of grief and she even looked a bit rejuvenated by a duty accomplished she was as stra ight and as thin as ever if it had not been for her hardened cheekbones and a few missing teeth she would have looked much youn ger than she really was she herself arranged for them to put the letters in a box sealed with pitch a nd told them to place it i n her grave in a way bes t to prot ect it from the dampness i n the morni ng she had a carpenter called who too k her measu rements for the coffin as she stood i n the parlor as if it wer e for a new dress she sho wed such vigor in her last hours that fernanda tho ught she was making fun of everyone úrsula with the experience that buendías died without any illness did not doubt at all that am aranta had receiv ed an omen of death but in any case she was tormented by the fear that with the business of the letters and th e anxiety of th e senders for them to a rrive quickly they would bury her alive in their confusion so she set about clearing out the house arguing with the intruders as she shouted at th em a nd by four in the afterno on she was s uccessful at that tim e amaranta ha d finished dividing her things among the poor and ha d left on the severe coffin of unfinished boards only the ch ange of clothing and the si mple cloth sl ippers that s he would wear in death she did not neglect tha t precau tion because she remembered th at wh en c olonel aureliano buendía died the y had to bu y a pair of new shoes for him becaus e all he had l eft were the b edroom slippers that h e wore in the workshop a little before five aure liano segundo came to fetch meme for the concert and was surp rised that the house was prepared for th e funeral if anyone seemed alive a t the mom ent it was the serene amara nta who had even had e nough time to cut her corns aurelia no segundo and meme took leave of her with mocking far ewells and promised her that on th e following saturday they would have a big resurrection party drawn by the public tal k that amar anta buendía was receivin g letters for the dead father antonio isab el arrived at five o’cl ock for the l ast rites and he had to wa it for more than fifteen minutes for the recipient to come out of her bath when he sa w her appear in a madapollam nightshirt and with her ha ir loose over her shoulders the decrepit parish priest thought that it wa s a trick and sent the altar boy away he thought however that he would take advanta ge of the occasion to have amaranta confess after twenty year s of reticen ce amaran ta answered simply that sh e did not need spiritual he lp of any kind because her conscience was clea n fernanda was scandalized without caring that pe ople could hear her she asked herself a loud what horrible sin amaranta had commit ted to make her prefer an impious death to th e shame of confession thereupon amaranta la y down and made úrsu la give public testimony as to her virgin ity “let no one have any il lusions” she shouted so that fernanda would hear h er “amaranta buendía is leaving this world just as she came into it she did not get up again lying on cushions as if she really were ill she braided her long hair and rolled it about her ears as death had told her it should be on her bier then she asked úrsula for a mirror and for the first time in more than fort y years sh e saw her face devasta ted by age and martyrdom and she was surprised at how much she resembled the m ental image tha t she had of herself úrsula understood by the silence in the bedroom that i t had begun to grow dark “say goodb ye to fernanda” she begged her on e minute of reconciliation is worth more than a whole life of friendship” “it’s of no use now” amaranta replied meme could not help thi nking about her when th ey turned on the lights on the improvised stage and she began the secon d part of the program in the middle of the piece someone wh ispered the news in her ear and the s ession stopped when he arrived home aureliano segundo had to push his way through the crowd to see the co rpse of the ag ed virgin ugly and discolored with the bla ck bandage on her hand and wrapped in the magnificent shroud she was laid out in the parlor beside the box of letters úrsula did not get up again after the nine nights of mourning fo r amaran ta santa sofía de la piedad took care of her she took her meals to her bedroom a nd annatto water for her to wash in and she kep t her up to date on everyth ing that hap pened in ma condo aurel iano segundo visited her frequently and he brought her clothing which she would place beside the bed along with the things most indispensable for daily life so that in a shor t time she had built up a world within reach of h er hand she managed to arouse a great love in little amaranta úr sula who was just like her and whom she taught how to read her lucidity the ability to be sufficient un herself made one think that sh e was naturally conquered by the weight of her hund red years but even though it was obvious that sh e was having trouble seeing no one suspected th at she was total ly blind she had so much time at her disposal then and so much interior silence to watc h over the life of the house that she was the first to notice meme’s silent tribulation “come here” she told her “now that were alone confess to this poor old woman what’ s bothering you” meme avoided the conv ersation with a short laugh úrsula did not insist but she ended up confirming her suspicions when meme did not come back to visit her she kn ew th at she was getting up earlier than usual that she did not have a moment ’s rest as she waited for the time for her to go out that sh e spent whole nights wal king back and forth in the adjoinin g bedroom and that the fluttering of a butterfly would bother her on one o ccasion she said that she was going to see aureli ano segundo and úrsula was surprised that fernanda’s imagination was so limited when her husband ca me to the ho use looking for his daughter it was too obvious that meme was involved in secret matters in pressing matters in repressed anxieties long before the night that fernanda upset the house because she ca ught her kissing a man in the movies meme was so wrapped u p in herself at tha t time that she accused úrsula of having told on her actually she told on herself for a long time she had been leaving a trail that would have awakened the most drowsy person and it took fernanda so l ong to discover it because she too was befogged by her relationship with the invisible doctors even so she finally noticed the deep silences th e sudden outb ursts the ch anges in mo od and th e contradictio ns of her da ughter she s et abou t on a disguised but implacable vigilance she let h er go out with her girl friends as always she helped her get dressed for the saturday parties and she neve r asked an embarrassing question that might arouse her she already had a great deal of proof that me me was doin g different things from what she sai d and yet she would give no indication of her sus picions hoping for the right moment one night meme said that she was going to the movies with her father a short time l ater fernand a heard the fireworks of the debau ch and the unm istakable accordion of aureliano segundo from the directio n of petra cotes’s place then she got dressed wen t to the mov ie theater an d in the darkness of the seats she recognized her daughter the upsetting feeling of cer tainty s topped her from seeing the man she wa s kissing but she manag ed to hear his tremulous voice in the midst of the deafening shouts and la ughter of the audience “i’m sorry lo ve” she heard him say and she took meme out of the place without saying a word to her put her th rough the sh ame of parading her along the nois y street of the turks and locked her up in her bedroom on the following day at six in the afternoon fe rnanda recog nized the voice of the man who came to call on her he was young sallow with dark and melancholy eyes which wou ld not have startled her s o much if sh e had known the gypsies and a dream y air tha t to any wom an with a h eart less rigid would have been enough to make her un derstand her daughter’s motives he was wearing a shabby linen suit with shoes that sh owed the de sperate defense of superimposed patches of white zinc and in his hand he was carrying a straw hat he had bought the saturday before in all of his life he could never have been as frightened as at th at moment b ut he had a dignity and presence th at spared him from humiliation and a genuine elegance that was defeated only by tarnished hands and nails that had been shattered by rough work fern anda howev er needed o nly one look to guess his status of mechanic she saw that he was wearing his one sunday suit and that underneath his shirt h e bore the rash of the ban ana com pany she woul d not let hi m speak sh e would no t even let hi m come through the door which a moment later she had to close because the house was filled with yellow butter flies “go away” she told him “you’ve got no reason to come calling on any decent person” his name was mauricio babilonia he had been born and rai sed in macondo and he was an apprentice mechanic in the banana company ga rage meme had met him by chance one afternoon when she went with patricia brown to get a ca r to take a drive through the groves since the chauffeur wa s sick they as signed him to take them and meme was finally abl e to satisfy her desire to sit next to the driver and see what he did unlike the regular ch auffeur mauricio babilon ia gave her a practical lesson that was during the time th at meme was beginning to frequent m r brown’s house and it was still considered improper for a lady to driv e a car so she was satisfied with the technical information and she did not see mauricio babilonia again for several months later on she would remember that du ring the drive her attenti on had been called to his masculine b eauty excep t for the coar seness of his hands but that afterwar d she had mentioned to pa tricia brown that she had been bothered by hi s rather proud sense of security the first saturday tha t she went to the movies with her father she saw mauricio babilonia ag ain with his linen suit sitting a few seats away from them and she noti ced that h e was not payi ng much attention to th e film in order to turn around and l ook at her meme was bothered by th e vulgarity of that afterward mauricio babilonia came over to say hello to aureliano segundo and only then did meme find out that they knew ea ch other becaus e he had wo rked in aureliano triste’s early power plant and h e treated h er father with the air of an employee that fact relieved the dislik e that his pr ide had caus ed in her th ey had never been alone together nor had they spo ken except i n way of greeting the night when she dreamed tha t he was savin g her from a shipwreck and she did not f eel gratitude but rage it was as if she had given him the opportunity he was waitin g for since meme yearned for just the opposite not only with mauricio ba bilonia but with any other man who was interested in her therefore she was so indignant after the drea m that instead of hating him she felt an irresistible urge to see him the anxiety beca me more intense during the course of the week an d on saturday it was so p ressing that she had to make a great effort for mauricio babil onia not to notice tha t when he greeted her in the movies her heart was in h er mouth d azed b y a co nfused feeling of pleasure and rage she gave hi m her hand for the first time and onl y then did mauricio babilonia let h imself shake hers mem e managed to repent her impulse in a fraction of a second but the repentan ce changed i mmediately into a cruel satisfaction on seeing that his hand too was sweaty and cold that night she realized that she would not have a moment of rest until she showed mauricio babilon ia the uselessness of his aspiration an d she spent the week turning that anxiety abou t in her mind she resorted to all kinds of useless tricks so that patricia brown would go g et the car with her finally she made use of the american redhead who was spendin g his vacatio n in macond o at that tim e and with the pretext of learning about new models of cars she had him take her to the garage from the moment she sa w him meme l et herself be deceived by herself and be lieved that what was rea lly going on was tha t she could not bear the desire to be alone with mauric io babilonia and she was made indignant by the certainty that he understo od that wh en he saw her a rrive “i came to s ee the n ew models” meme said “that’s a fin e excuse” he said meme realized tha t he was burning in the heat of his pride and she desp erately looked for a wa y to humiliate him but he would not give her any ti me “don’t get upset” he said to her in a low voice “it’s not the first time that a wo man has gone crazy over a man” she felt so defeated that she left the garage without seeing the new models and she spent the night turning over in bed and weeping with indignation the amer ican redhead who was really beginning to interest her looked like a baby in diapers it was then that she realized that the yellow butterflies preceded th e appearances of mauricio babilonia she had seen them before especially over the garage and she had thought that th ey were drawn b y the smell of paint once she had s een them flu ttering about her head before she went into the mo vies but when mauricio babilonia began to pursue her like a ghost that o nly she could identify in the crowd sh e understood that the bu tterflies had something to do with him mauricio babilonia was always in th e audience at the concerts at the movi es at high mass and she did not hav e to see him to know that he was th ere because th e butterflies were always there once aureliano segundo beca me so impa tient with the suffocating fluttering that she felt th e impulse to confide her secret to him as she had p romised but instinct told her that he would laugh as usual and say “what would your mother say if she found out” one morning wh ile she was pruning the roses fernanda let out a cry of frig ht and had meme taken away from the spot wher e she was wh ich was the same pla ce in the gard en where r emedios th e beauty had gone up to heaven she had thought for an instan t that the miracle was going to be rep eated with h er daughter because she had been bo thered by a sudden flappi ng of wings it was th e butterflies meme saw them as if they had suddenly been bo rn out of the light and he r heart gave a turn at that moment mauricio babilonia came in with a package that according to what he said was a present from patricia brown meme s wallowed her blush absorb ed her tri bulation an d even ma naged a natura l smile as she asked him the favor of le aving it on the railing because her hands were dirty from the garden the only thing that fernanda noted in th e man whom a few month s later she was to expel from the house without r emembering where she ha d seen him was the bilious texture of his skin “he’s a very strange man” fernanda said “you can see in his face tha t he’s going to die” meme thou ght that her mother h ad been imp ressed by the butterflie s when they finished pruning the row bushes she washed her hands and took the package to her bedroom to open it it was a kind of chinese toy made up of five concentric boxes and in the last one ther e was a card laboriously inscribed by s omeone who could barely write we’ll get together saturday at the movies meme felt with an aftershock that th e box had been on the railing for a long time within reach of fernanda’s curiosity and although she was flat tered by the audacity an d ingenuity of mauricio babilonia she was moved by his inno cence in exp ecting that s he would keep the date meme knew at that time that aureliano segundo had an appoint ment on saturday night nevertheless the fire of anxiety burned her so mu ch during the course of the week th at on saturday she convinced her father to leave her alone in the theater an d come back for her after the show a nocturnal butterfly fluttered abo ut her head while the lights were on and then i t happened when the lights wen t out mauricio babilonia sat down beside her meme f elt herself s plashing in a bog of hesitation from which she could only be rescued as had occurred in her dreams by that man smelling of greas e whom she could barely see in the sha dows “if you hadn’t come” he said “you never would have seen me again” meme felt the weight of his hand on her knee an d she knew that th ey wer e both arriving at th e other side of abandonment at that ins tant “what shocks me about you” she said smilin g “is that you always say exactly what you shouldn’t be saying” she lost her mind over him she could not sleep an d she lost her appetite an d sank so deeply into solitude that even her father beca me an annoyance she worked out an intricate web of false dates to throw fernanda off the track lost sight of her girl friends leaped over conventions to be with mauricio babilonia at any time and at any place at first his crudeness bothered her the first time that they wer e alone on the deserted fields behind the garage he pulled her me rcilessly into an animal state tha t left her exhausted it took her time to re alize that it was also a form of tenderness and it was th en th at she lost her calm and liv ed only for h im upset b y the desire to sink into his stupefying odor of grease washed off by lye a s hort time before the dea th of amaran ta she suddenly stumbled into in open space of lucidity within the madn ess and she tr embled befo re the uncer tainty of the future then she heard about a wom an who mad e predictions from cards and went to see her in secret it wa s pilar ternera as soon as pilar saw her com e in she was aware of meme’s hidden motives “sit down” she told her “i don’t need cards to tell the future of a buendía” meme did not know and n ever would that the centenarian witch was her greatgrandmother nor would she have believed it after the aggressive realism with which she revealed to her that the anxiety of fallin g in love could not find repose except in b ed it was th e same point of view as mauricio babilonia’s but meme resisted believing it becaus e underneath it a ll she imagined that it had been inspired by the poor judgment of a mechanic she thought then th at love on one side was defeating love on the other becau se it was cha racteristic of men to den y hunger once their appetites were sa tisfied pilar ternera not only cleared up that m istake she also offered the old cano pied bed wh ere she had conceived arcadio meme’s grandfather and where afterward she concei ved aureliano josé she also taught her how to avoid an unwanted con ception by means of the evaporation of mustard plasters and gave her recipes for potions that in cases of trouble could expel “even the remorse of conscience” that interview instilled in meme the same feeling of bravery that she had felt on the drunken evening amaranta’s death however oblig ed her to postpone the decision while the ni ne nights lasted she did not once leave the side of ma uricio babilonia who mingled with the crowd that invaded the house then came the long period of mourning and the obligatory withdrawal and they separated for a time those were da ys of such inne r agitation such irrepressible anxiety and so many repres sed urges that on th e first evening th at meme wa s able to get out she went straight to pilar ternera’s she surrendered to mauricio babil onia without resistance without shyn ess without formalities and with a vocation tha t was so fluid and an intuition that was so wise that a mo re suspicious man than hers would have confused th em with obvious experience they made lov e twice a week for more than three months pro tected by th e innocent complicity o f aureliano segundo who believed without suspicion in his daughter’s alibis simply in order to set her free from her mother’s rigidity on the night that fernanda surprised them in the movies aureliano segundo felt weighted down by the burden of his conscience and he visited meme in the bedroom where fernanda kept her locked up trusting that she would reveal to him the confidences that sh e owed him but meme denied everything she was so sure of herself so anchored in her solitude that aureli ano segundo had the imp ression that no link existed between them anymore that the comrades hip and th e complicity were nothing but an illusion of the pa st he thought of speaking to mauricio babilonia thinking that his authority as his former boss woul d make him desist from hi s plans but petra cotes convinced hi m that it was a woman’s business so he was left fl oating in a limbo of indecision barel y sustained by the hope that the confinement woul d put an end to his daughter’s troubles meme showed no signs of affliction on the con trary from the next roo m úrsula perceived the peaceful rhythm of her sl eep the serenity of her ta sks the ord er of her meal s and the good health of her digest ion the only thing that i ntrigued úrs ula after almost two months of punishment was that meme d id not take a bath in the morning like everyone els e but at sev en in the evening once she thought of warning her about the scorpions but meme wa s so distant convinced th at she had given her a way that she preferred not to distur b her with the impertinences of a greatgreat grandmother the yellow butterflies would invade the h ouse at dusk every night on her way b ack from her bat h meme would find a de sperate fern anda killing butterflies with an insecticide bomb “this is terrible” she wo uld say “all my life they to ld me tha t butterflies at night bring bad luck” one night while meme was in the ba throom fernanda wen t into her bedro om by chan ce and there were so m any butterflies that she coul d scarcely br eathe she grabbed for th e nearest piece of cloth to shoo them away and her heart froze with terror as she connected her daughter’s evening bath s with the mu stard plaster s that rolled onto the floor she did not wait for an opportune moment as she had the first time on the following day she invited the new mayor to lunch like her he had come down from the highlands and she asked him to station a guard in the backyard because sh e had the impression that hens were being stolen that night the guard brought down maurici o babilonia as he was lifting up the tiles to get into the bathroo m where meme was wai ting for him naked and tr embling with love amon g the scorpions and butterflies as she had done al most every night for the past few m onths a bullet lodged in his spinal column reduced him to hi s bed for the rest of his life he died of old age in solitude without a moan without a protest with out a single moment of betrayal tor mented by memories an d by the yell ow butterflies who did not give him a moment’s peace and ostr acized as a chicken thief chapter the events that would deal macondo its fatal blow were just showing themselves when they brought meme buendía’ s son home the public si tuation wa s so uncertai n then th at no one had sufficient spirit to become involved with private scandals so that fernanda was able to count on an atmosphere that enabled her to keep the child hidden as if he had never existed she had to take him in because the circumsta nces under which they b rought him made rejection impossible she had to tolerate him against her will for the rest of her lif e because at the moment of truth sh e lacked the courage to go through with her inner determinati on to drown him in th e bathroom cistern she locked him up in colonel aureliano buendía’s ol d workshop she succeeded in convincing santa sofía de la piedad that she had found him floa ting in a basket úrsula would die without ever knowing his origin little amaran ta úrsula who w ent into the workshop once when fernanda was feeding the child also believed the ver sion of the floating basket aureliano segundo having broke n finally with his wife because of the irrational wa y in which she handled meme’s tragedy did not know of the existence of his grandson until three ye ars after th ey brought hi m home wh en the child escaped from captivity through an oversight on fe rnanda’s part and appeared on the porch for a fraction of a second naked with matted hair an d with an impressive sex organ that was like a turkey’s wattles as if he were not a h uman ch ild but the en cyclopedia definition of a can nibal fernanda had not counted on that nasty trick of her incorrigible fate the child was like the return of a s hame that she had thought exiled by he r from the house forever as soon as they carried off mauricio babilonia with his shatter ed spinal column fernanda had worked out the m ost minute details of a p lan destined to wipe out all traces of the burden without con sulting her husband she packed her bags put the three ch anges of clothi ng that her daughter would need into a smal l suitcase and went to get h er in her bedroom a half hour before the train arrived “let’s go renata” she tol d her she gave no explanation meme for her part di d not expect or want any she not only did no t know where they were go ing but it would have been the sam e to her if they had been ta king her to the slaughter house she had not spoken again nor would she do so for the rest of her life from the time that sh e heard the shot in the backyard a nd the simultaneous cry of pain from mauricio babilonia when her mother ordere d her out of the bedroom she did not comb her hair or wash her face and sh e got into th e train as if she were wa lking in her sleep not even noticing the yellow butterflies that were still accompan ying her fernanda never found out nor did she take the trouble to whether that stony silence was a determination of her will or whether she had become mute because of the impact of the tragedy meme barely took notice of the journey through the formerly enchanted region she did not see the shady endless banana groves on both sides of the tracks she did not see the white h ouses of the gringos or thei r gardens dried out by dust and heat or the women in sh orts and bluestriped shirts playing cards on the ter races she di d not see the oxcarts on the dusty ro ads loaded d own with bunches of b ananas she did not see the girls diving into the transparent rivers like t arpons leaving the pass engers on the train with the bitterness of thei r splendid breasts or the miserable huts of the wo rkers all huddled together where mauricio babilo nia’s yellow butterflies fluttered abou t and in th e doorways of which there were green and squalid children sitting on their pots and pregnant wom en who shouted insults at the train that fleeting vision which had been a celebration for her wh en she came home from school pas sed through meme’s heart without a quiver she did not look out of the window not even when the burning dampness of the groves ended and the train went through a poppyladen plain where the carbonized skeleton of the spanish g alleon still sa t and then came out into the dear air alongside the f rothy dirty sea where al most a cen tury before josé arcadio bu endía’s illusions had met defeat at five o’clock in the afternoon when they had come to the l ast station in the swamp she got out of the train because fernanda made her they got into a small carriage that looked like an enormous bat drawn by an asthmati c horse and they wen t through the desolate city in the endless streets of which split by saltiness there was th e sound of a piano lesson just like the one that fernanda heard during the siestas of her adolesce nce they went on b oard a riverboat the wood en wheel of which had a sound of conflagration and whose rusted metal plates reverberated like th e mouth of an oven meme shut herself up in her cabi n twice a day fernan da left a plate of food by her bed and twice a da y she took it away intact not because meme had resolved to die of hunger but becaus e even the sm ell of food was repugnan t to her and her stomach rejected even water no t even she herself knew that her fertility had outwitted the mustard vapors just as fernanda did not know until almost a year later when they brought the child in the suffocating cabin maddened by the vibration of the meta l plates and the unbeara ble stench o f the mud stirred up by the paddl e wheel mem e lost track of the days much time had passed when she sa w the last yellow butterfly destroyed in the blades of the fan and she admitted as an irremediable truth that mauricio babilonia had died she did not let herself be defeated by resignation however she kept on thinking about him during the arduous muleback cr ossing of th e hallucinati ng plateau where aureli ano segundo had become lost when he was looking for the mo st beautiful woman who had ever appeared on the face of the earth and wh en they wen t over the mo untains alon g indian trails and entered the gloomy city in wh ose stone alleys the funereal bronze b ells of thirtytwo churches tolled that night they slept in the abandoned colonial mansion on board s that fernanda laid on the floor of a room invaded by weeds wrapped in the shreds of curtains that they pulled off the windows and that fell to pieces with every turn of the body meme knew where they were because in the flight of her insomnia she saw pass by the gentleman dressed in black who m they delivered to the ho use inside a lead box on one distant christmas eve on the follo wing day after mass fernanda took her to a somber building that meme recognized immediatel y from her mother’s stories of the convent wher e they h ad rais ed her to be a queen and then sh e understood th at they had come to th e end of th e journey while fernanda was speakin g to someon e in the office next doo r meme remained in a parlor checkered with large oil paintin gs of coloni al archbishops still wearin g an etamine dress with small black flowers and s tiff high shoes which were swollen by the cold o f the uplands she was standing in the center of the parlor thinking about mauricio babilonia under the yello w stream of light from the stained glass windows when a very beautiful novice came out of the office carryin g her suitcase with the thr ee ch anges of clothing as she p assed meme sh e took her h and without stopping “come renata” she said to her meme took her hand and let hersel f be led the l ast tim e that fernanda sa w her trying to keep up with the novice the iron grating o f the cloister had just closed behind her she was still thinking about mauricio babilonia his smell of grease an d his halo o f butterflies and she wo uld keep o n thinking about him for all the da ys of her life until the remote a utumn morn ing when she died of old age with her name chan ged and her head shaved and witho ut ever having spoken a word in a gloomy hospital in cracow fernanda returned to ma condo on a train protected by armed police during the trip s he noticed the tension of the passengers the military prep arations in the towns along the line and an atmosphere rarified by the certain ty that som ething serious was going to happen but she had no information until she reached macon do and they to ld her that josé arcad io segundo was inciting the workers of the banan a company to strike “tha t’s all we n eed” fernanda said to herself “an anarchist in the family” the strike broke out two weeks later and it did not have the dramatic consequences that had been feared the workers demanded tha t they not be obliged to cut and load bananas on sundays and the position seemed so j ust that even father anto nio isabel interceded i n its favor because he fou nd it in acco rdance with the laws of god that v ictory along with other actions that were initiated during the following months drew the colorless josé arcadio segundo out of his an onymity for people had been accustomed to say that he was only good fo r fillin g up the town with f rench whores with the same impulsive decision with which he had aucti oned off his fighting cocks in order to organize a harebrained boat business he gave up his position as foreman in the banana company and took the side of th e workers quite soon he was pointed out as the agent of an international conspiracy against public order one night during the course of a week darkened by somber rumors he miraculously esca ped four revolver shots taken at him by an unknown party as he was leaving a secret meeting the atmosphere of the following months was s o tense tha t even úrsula perceived it in her dark corner and she had the im pression that once more she was living through the dangerous times when he r son aureliano carried the homeopathic pills of subversion in his pocket she tried to speak to j osé arcadio segundo to let him know about that precedent b ut aureliano segundo told her that since the night of the attempt on his life no one knew his wh ereabouts “just like aureliano” úrsula exclaimed “it’s as if the world were repeating itself” fernanda was immune to the uncertainty of those days she had no contact with the outside world since the violent a ltercation sh e had had with her husband over her having decided memes fate withou t his con sent aureliano segundo was p repared to rescue his d aughter with the help of the police if necessary b ut fernanda showed him so me papers that were pr oof that she had entered the convent of her own free will meme had indeed signed once she was already behind the iron grating and she did it with the same indifference with which she had allowed herself to be led away underneath it all aureliano segundo did not believe in the legitimacy of the proof just as he never believed that mauricio babilonia had gone into the yard to steal chickens but both expedients served to eas e his con science and thu s he could go back witho ut remorse under the sha dow of petra cotes where he revived his noisy revelry and unli mited gourmandizing foreign to the restlessness of the town deaf to úrsula’s quiet predictions fe rnanda gave the las t tam to the screw of her preconceived plan she wrote a long letter to her s on josé arcadio who was then ab out to take his first orders and in it she told him th at his sister renata had expired in the pe ace of the lord and as a consequence of the black vomit then she put amar anta úrs ula under th e care of san ta sofía de la piedad and dedicated hers elf to organizing her correspondence with the invisible doctors which had been upset by meme’s trouble the first thing that sh e did was to set a definite date for the postponed telepathic operation but the invisible doctors ans wered her that it was not wise so long as the state of social agitation continued in macondo she was so urgent and so poorly informed that she exp lained to them in another letter th at there was no such state of agitation and that everything was the result of the lunacy of a brother inlaw of hers who was fiddlin g around at that time in that labor union nonsense just as he had been involved with cockfighting and riverboats before they were still not in agreement on the hot wednesday when an aged nun knocked at the door bearing a small bask et on her arm when she ope ned the door santa s ofía de la piedad thought that it was a gift and tried to take the s mall bask et that was covered with a lo vely lace wra p but th e nun stopped her because she had instructions to give it personally and with the strictest secrecy to doña ferna nda del car pio de buen día it was me me’s son fernanda’s former spiritual director explained to her in a letter that he ha d been born two months before and that th ey ha d taken th e privilege o f baptizing him aureliano for h is gran dfather because his mother would not open her lips to tell them her wishes fernanda rose up inside against that trick of fa te but she had sufficient strength to h ide it in front of the nun “we’ll tell them that we f ound him flo ating in the basket” she said smiling “no one will believe it” the nun said “if they believe it in the b ible” fernanda replied “i don’t see why they sh ouldn’t believe it fro m me” the nun lunched at the house while she waited for the train back and in accordance with the discretion they asked of her she did not mention the child again but fernanda viewed her as an undesirable witness of h er shame an d lamented the fact that they h ad abandoned th e medieva l custom of hanging a messenger who bore bad news it was then that she d ecided to drown the chil d in the cistern as soon as the nun left but her h eart was n ot strong enough a nd she preferred to wait patiently unti l the infinite goodness of god would free her from the annoyance the new au reliano was a year old when the ten sion of the people broke with no forewarning josé arcadio segundo and other union leaders wh o had remai ned underground until then suddenl y appeared on e weekend a nd organized demonstrati ons in towns throughout the banana r egion the police merel y maintained public order but on monday night the leaders were taken from their homes and sent to jail in the capital of the pr ovince with twopound irons on their legs taken among them were josé arcadio segundo and lorenzo gavilán a colonel in the mex ican revolution exiled in macondo who said that he had been wi tness to the h eroism of his comrade ar temio cruz they were s et free however within three mon ths because of the fact th at the govern ment and the banana com pany could not reach an agreement as to who sho uld feed them in jail th e protests of the workers this time were based on the lack of sanitary facilities in their living quarters the nonexistence of medical services and terrible work ing conditions they stated furthermore that they were no t being paid in real money but in scrip which was good only to buy virginia ham in the company co mmissaries josé arcadio segundo was put in jail because he revealed th at the s crip system was a way for the company to finance its fruit ships which without the commissary merchandise would have to return empty from new orlea ns to the banana ports the other complaints were comm on knowledge the company physici ans did not examine the sick but had them line up behind one another in the dispensari es and a nurse would put a pill the color of copper sulfate on th eir tongues whether they had mal aria g onorrhea or constipati on it was a cure tha t was so common that children would stand in line several times and instead of s wallowing the pills would take them ho me to use as bingo markers the co mpany workers were crowded together in miserable barracks the engineers instead of putting in to ilets had a portable latrine for every fifty people brought to the ca mps a t christmas ti me and they he ld public d emonstrations of how to use them so that th ey would last longer the decrepit lawyer s dressed in black who during other times had besieged colonel aureliano buendí a and who now were controlled by the banana company dismissed th ose demands with d ecisions that seem ed like acts of magic when the wor kers drew up a list of unan imous petitio ns a long ti me passed before they were able to n otify the ban ana co mpany officially as soon as he found out about the agr eement mr brown hitched his luxurious glassedin coach to the train and disappeared from macondo along with th e more prom inent representatives of his company nonetheles s some workers found one of them the following saturday in a brothel and they mad e him sign a copy of the sheet with the d emands while he was naked with the women who had helped to entrap him the mourn ful lawyers s howed in co urt that that man had n othing to do with the co mpany and in order that no one doubt their arguments they had him jailed as an impostor la ter on mr brown was surprised tra veling incognito in a thirdclass coach and they made him sign another copy of the demands on the following day he appeared before the judges with his hair dyed black and speaking flawless spanish the lawyers showed that th e man was not mr jack brown the superintendent of the bana na company born in pr attville alabama but a harmless vendor of me dicinal plants born in ma condo and baptized there with the name of dagoberto fonseca a while later faced with a new attemp t by the wor kers the lawyers publicly exhibited mr brown’s death certifica te attes ted to by consuls and foreign ministers which bor e witness that on june ninth last he had been run ov er by a fire engine in chicago tired of that hermeneutical delirium the workers turned away f rom the auth orities in macondo and b rought their complaints u p to the higher courts i t was ther e that the sl eightofhand lawyers prov ed tha t the demands lacked all validity for the simple reason that the banana company did not have never had had and never would have any workers in its service because th ey were all hired on a temporary and occasional basis so that the fable of the virg inia ham was nonsense the same as that of the miraculous p ills and the yuletide toilets and by a decision of the court it was established and set down in solemn decrees that the workers did not exist the great strike broke out cultivation stopped halfway the fruit rotted on the trees and th e hundredtwentycar trains remained on the sidings the idle workers overflowed the towns the street of th e turks echo ed with a sa turday tha t lasted for sev eral days an d in the poo lroom at th e hotel jacob they had to arrange twentyfourhour sh ifts that was where josé arcadio segundo was on the day it was announced that th e army had been assigned to reestablish public order although he was not a man given to omens th e news was like an anno uncement of de ath that he had been waiting for ever since tha t distant mo rning wh en colonel gerineldo márquez had l et him see an execution t he bad o men did not ch ange his solemn ity however he took the shot he had planned and it was g ood a short time later the drumbeats the shrill of the bugle the shouting and running of the people told him that not only had the game of pool come to an end but also the silent and solitary game that he ha d been playi ng with hims elf ever since tha t dawn execution then he wen t out into th e street and saw them th ere were three re giments whose march in time to a galley drum made the earth tremble their snorting of a ma nyheaded dragon filled the glow of noon with a pestilential vapor they were short stocky and brute like they perspired with the sweat of a horse and had a smell of sunta nned hide an d the tacitur n and impen etrable persev erance of men from th e uplands although it took them over an hour to pass by one might have thought that they were onl y a few squads marching in a circle because they were all identical sons of the same bitch and with the sam e stolidity they all bore the weight of their packs and ca nteens th e shame of th eir rifles with fixed bayonets and the chancre of bli nd obedien ce and a sens e of honor úrsula heard them pass from her be d in the shadows and she made a crow wi th her fingers santa sofí a de la pie dad existed for an instan t leaning ov er the embro idered tablecl oth that she had just ironed and she thought of her son josé arcadio seg undo who without changi ng expression watch ed the last sol diers pass by the door of the hotel jacob martial law enabled the army to assu me the func tions of arbitrator in the controversy but no effort at conciliation was made as soon as they appeared in macond o the soldiers put aside their rifles and cut and loaded the bananas and started the trains running the workers who had been content to wait until then went into the woods with no other weapons but their working machetes and they beg an to s abotage the s abotage they bu rned plantati ons and co mmissaries tore up track s to impede th e passage of the trains tha t began to o pen their path with machi negun fire and they cu t telegraph and telephone wires the irrigation ditc hes were stained with blood mr brown who was alive in the electrified ch icken coop was taken out of macon do with his family and those of his fellow countrymen and brought to a safe place un der the protection of the army the situation was threatening to lead to a b loody and u nequal civil war when th e authorities called upon the workers to gather in macondo the summons announced th at the civil and military leader of the province would arrive on the following friday ready to intercede in the conflict josé arcadio segundo wa s in the cro wd tha t had gathered at the sta tion o n friday since early in the morning he had tak en part in a meeting of union leaders and had been commissioned along with colonel gavilán to mingle in the crowd and orient it according to how things went he did not feel well and a salty pas te was b eginning to collect on his pala te when he n oticed th at the army had set up machinegun emplacements around the small square and that the wired city of the banana company was protected by artillery pieces around twel ve o’clock waiting for a train t hat was not arriving mo re than three thousand people workers women and childre n had spille d out of the open space in front of t he station and were pressi ng into th e neighboring streets wh ich the army had closed off with rows of machine guns at that ti me it all se emed more like a jubilant fair than a waiting crowd they had brought over the fritter an d drink stands from the street of the turks and the peopl e were in goo d spirits as they bore the tedium of waiting and the scorchin g sun a sho rt time before three o’clock the rumor sp read that the official train would not a rrive until the following day the crowd let out a sigh of disappointment an army lieu tenant then climbed up onto the roo f of the statio n where th ere were four machinegun emplacements aiming at the crowd a nd called for silence next to josé arcadio segundo there was a barefooted woman ver y fat with two children between the ages of four and seven she was car rying the sm aller one an d she asked josé arcadio segundo without knowing him if he would lift up the other o ne so that h e could hear better josé arcadio seg undo put the child on his shoulders many years later that child would still tell to the disbelief of all that he had seen the lieutenant rea ding decree no of the civil and military leader of the province through an old phonograph horn it had be en signed by general carlos cortes vargas and his secretary major enrique garcía is aza and in three articles of eighty words he declared the strikers to be a “bunch of hoodlums ” and he authorized the ar my to shoot to kill after the decree was read in the midst of a deafen ing hoot of protest a captain took the place of the lieuten ant on th e roof of the sta tion and with the horn he s ignaled that he wanted to speak the crowd was q uiet again “ladies and gentlemen” the captain s aid in a low vo ice that was slow and a little tired “you have five minutes to withdraw ” the redoubled hooting and shouting drowned out th e bugle call that annou nced the star t of the count no o ne moved five minutes have passed ” the captai n said in the same ton e “one more minute and we’ll open fire” josé arcadi o segundo sweating ice lowered the child and gave him to the wo man “those bastards might just shoot” she murmured josé arcadio segundo did not have ti me to speak because at th at instan t he recognized the hoarse voice of colonel gavilán echoing the words of the woman with a shout intoxicated by the tension by the miraculous depth of the silence and furthermore convinced that nothing could move that crowd h eld tight in a fascination with death josé arcadio segundo raised himself up over the he ads in front of him and for the first time in his life he raised his voice “you bastards” he shouted “take the extra minute and stick it up your ass” after his shout something happened that did not br ing on fright but a kind of hallucination the captain gave the order to fire and fourteen machin e guns answered at once but it all seemed like a farce it was as if the machine guns had been load ed with caps because their panting rattle could be heard and their incandescent spitting could be seen but not the slightest reaction was perceived not a cry not even a sigh among the compact cro wd that s eemed petrified by an ins tantaneous invulnerabilit y suddenly on one sid eof the station a cry o f death tore open the enchantment “aaaagh mother” a seis mic voice a volcanic brea th the roar o f a cataclysm broke out in the center of the crowd with a great potential of expansion josé arcadio segundo barely had time to pick up the child while the mother with the other one was swallowed up by the crowd that swirled about i n panic many years later that child would still tell in spi te of people thinking that he was a crazy old man how josé ar cadio segundo had lifted him over his he ad an d hauled him almost in the air as i f floating on the terror of the crowd toward a nea rby street t he child’s privileged position allowed him to see a t that mom ent that th e wild mass was starting to get to the corner and the row of machine guns opened fire several voices shouted at the same time “get down get down” the people in front had already done so swept down by th e wave of b ullets the s urvivors instead of getting down tried to go back to the small square and the panic became a drag on’s tail as one compact wave ran against another which wa s moving in the oppos ite direction toward the other dragon’s tail in th e street acro ss the wa y wh ere the m achine guns were also firing without cease they were penned in swirling about in a giga ntic whirlwind that little by little was being reduced to its epicenter a s the edges were system atically being cut off all around like an onion being peeled by the insatiable and metho dical shears of the machine guns the child saw a wom an kneeling with her arms i n the sh ape of a cross in an open space mysteriously free of the stamp ede josé arcadio segundo put him up there at the mo ment he fell with his face bathed in bl ood before the colossal troop wiped out the em pty space the kneeling woman the li ght of the high drought stricken sky and the who rish world where úrsula iguarán had sold so many little candy a nimals when josé arcadio segundo came to he was lying face up in the darkness he realized that he was riding on an endless and silent train and that his head was caked with dry blood and that all his bones ached he felt an intolerable desire to sleep prepared to sleep for m any hours safe from the terror and the horror he made himsel f comfortable on the side that pained him less and only then did he discover that he was lying against dead people there was no free space in the car except fo r an aisle in the middle several hours must have passed since the massacre because the corpses ha d the same temperature as a plaster in autumn and the same co nsistency of petrified foam that it had and those who had put them in the car had had ti me to pile th em up in the same wa y in which th ey transported bunches of bananas trying to flee fr om the nightmare josé arcadio segundo dragged himself from one car to a n other in th e direction i n which th e train was heading and in the flash es of light that broke through the wooden slats as they went through sleeping towns he saw the ma n corpses woman

with a buckle of more lia silver wit h which he had tried to open his way through the panic when he got to the first car he jumped into the darkness and lay beside the tracks until the train had passed it was the longest one he had ever seen with almost two hundred freight cars and a locomotive at either end a nd a third one in the middle it had no lights not even the red and green running lights and it slipped off with a no cturnal an d stealthy vel ocity on to p of the cars there could be seen th e dark shapes of the soldiers with their emplaced ma chine guns after midnight a torrentia l cloudburst came up josé arcadio segundo did not know where it was that h e had j umped off but he knew that b y goin g in the opp osite directio n to th at of the train h e would reach macondo after walking for more than three hour s soaked to the skin with a terrible headache h e was able to make out the first houses in the light of dawn attracted by the smell of coffee he went into a kitchen where a woman with a child in her arms was leaning over the stove “hello” he s aid exhausted “i’m josé arcadio segundo buendía” he pronounced his whole name letter by letter in order to convince her that he was alive he was wise in doing so because th e woman had tho ught that he was an app arition as she s aw the dirty shadowy figure with his head and clo thing dirty wi th blood and touched wi th the solem nity of death come through the door she recognized him she brought him a blanket so that he could wrap himself up while his cloth es dried by the fire she warmed som e water to wash his woun d which was only a flesh wound and she gave him a clean diap er to bandage his head then she gave him a mug of coffee without sugar as she had been told the buendías drank it and she spread his clothing out near the fire josé arcadio segundo did not speak u ntil he had finished drinking his coffee “there must have been three thousan d of them” he murmured “what” “the dead” he clarified “it must have b een an of the people w ho were at th e station” the wom an measured him with a pi tying look “t here haven’t been any dead here” she said “since the ti me of your u ncle the col onel nothin g has happen ed in macon do” in the three kitchen s where josé arcadio seg undo stopped before reachi ng home they told hi m the same thing “there weren’t any dead he went through the small squ are by the station and h e saw the fritter stands piled one on top of the other and he could find no trace of the massacre the streets were deserted under the persisten t rain and th e houses locked up with no trace of li fe inside the only huma n note wa s the first tolling of the bells for mass he knocked at the door at colonel gavilán’s house a pregnant wom an whom he had s een several ti mes closed the door in his face “he left” she said frightened “he went back to his own country” the main en trance to the wire chic ken coop was guarded as always by two local pol icemen who looked as if they were made of sto ne under th e rain with raincoats an d rubber boots on their marginal str eet the west indian negroes were singing saturday psalms josé arcadio segundo jumped over the courtyard wall and entered the house through the kitchen san ta sofía de l a piedad bar ely raised her voice “don’t let ferna nda see you ” she said “she’s just getting up” as if she were fulfill ing an implicit pact sh e took her son to the “chamberpot room” arranged melquíades’ broken down cot for him and at two in the afternoon while fernanda was takin g her siesta she passed a plate of food in to him th rough the window aureliano segundo had s lept at home because the ra in had ca ught him ti me and at th ree in the afternoon he was still waiting for it to clear inform ed in secret by santa sofía de la piedad he visited his brother in melquíades’ room at that ti me he did not believe the version of the massacre or the nightmare trip of the train lo aded with corpses traveling toward the sea either the night before he had read an extraordinary proclamation to the n ation which said that th e work ers had left the station a nd had returned home in peaceful groups the proclama tion also stated th at the union leaders with great patriotic spirit had reduced their demands to two points a reform of medical services and the building of latrines in the living q uarters it was stated later that when the military authorities o btained the agreement with the work ers they has tened to tell mr brown and he not only accepted the new conditions but offered to pay for three days of public festivities to celebrate the end of the conflict except th at when the mi litary asked him on what date they could announce the signing of the agreement he looked out the wi ndow at the sky crossed with lightning flashes and made a profound gesture of doubt “when the rain stops” he said “as long as th e rain lasts we’re suspending all activities” it had not rained for three month s and there had been a drought but when mr brown announced his decision a torrential downpour spread over the whole banana region it was the one that caught josé arcadio segundo o n his way to macondo a week later it was still raining the official version repeated a thousand times and ma ngled out all over the co untry by every means of communicati on the government found at hand was finally accepted there were no dead the satisfied workers had go ne back to their familie s and the b anana company was suspending all activity until the rains stopped martial law con tinued with an eye to the necessity of taking emergency measures for the public d isaster of th e endless downpour but the troops were confined to quarters during the day the soldi ers walked th rough the torrents in the streets wi th their pant legs rolled up playing with boats with the chil dren at night a fter taps they knocked d oors down with their rifle butts hauled suspec ts out of their beds and took th em off on trips from which there was no return the search for and extermination of the hoodlums murderers arsonists and rebels of decree no was still going on but the military de nied it even to the relatives of the victims who crowded the commandan t’s offices in search of news “you must have been dreaming” the officers insisted “n othing has happened in macondo nothi ng has ever happened and nothing ever will happen “this is a happy town” in that way they were finally able to wipe o ut the union leaders the only survivor was josé arcadio segundo one fe bruary night the unmistakable blows of rifle butts were heard at the door aureliano segundo w ho was still waiting for it to clear opened the door to six soldiers under the command of an offi cer soaking from the rain without saying a word they search ed the house room by room closet by closet from parlor to pantry úrsula woke up when they turned on the light in her room and she did not breathe while the march went on but held her fingers in the shape of a cross pointin g them to wh ere the soldiers were mo ving about santa sofía de la piedad managed to warn josé arcadio segundo who was sleeping in melquíades’ room but he could see that it was to o late to try to escap e so santa sofía de la pieda d locked the door again and he put o n his shirt and his shoes and sat down on the co t to wait for them at that moment they were searching the gold workshop th e officer made them open the padlock and with a quick sweep of his lantern he saw the workbench and the glass cupboard with bottles of acid and instruments that were sti ll where their owner had left them and he seemed to understand that no one lived in that room he wisely asked aureliano segundo if h e was a silversmith however and th e latter explained to him that it had been colonel aureliano buendía’s workshop “oho” the officer said turned on the lights and ordered such a minu te search that they did no t miss th e eighteen little gold fishes that had not been melted down and th at were hidd en behind th e bottles is their tin can the officer examined th em one by o ne on the workbench an d then h e turned human “i’d like to take one if i may” he s aid “at one ti me they we re a mark of subversion but now they’re relics” he was young almost an adolescent with no sign of timidity and with a natural pleas ant mann er that had not shown itself until th en aureliano segundo gave him the littl e fish the officer put it in his shirt pocket with a ch ildlike glow in his eyes an d he put the others back i n the can an d set it back where it had been “it’s a wonderful memento” he said “colonel aureliano buendía was one of our greatest men” nevertheless that surge of humanity did not alter his professional conduct at melquíades’ room which was locked up again with the padlock santa sofía de la piedad tried one last hope “no one has lived in that room for a century” she said the officer had it opened a nd flashed the beam of the lantern o ver it and aureliano segundo and santa sofía de la piedad saw the arab eyes of josé arcadio segundo at th e moment wh en the ra y of lig ht passed over his face and they understood that it was the end of one anxiety and the beginning of another which would find relief only in resignation but the offic er continued examining t he room with the lantern and showed no sign of interest until he discovered the seventytwo chambe rpots piled up in the cupboards then he turned on the light josé arcadio segundo was sitting on the edge of the cot ready to go more solemn an d pensive than ever in t he background were the shelves with the shredded books the rolls of parchment and the clean and orderl y worktable with the ink still fres h in the inkwells there was the same pureness in the air the same clar ity the sa me respite from dust and destruction tha t aureliano segundo had known in c hildhood and that only colonel aureliano buendía could not perceive but the officer was only inter ested in the chamberpots “how many people live in this house’ he asked “five ” the officer obviously did not understand he paused with his glance on the space where aureliano segundo and santa soft de la piedad were still seeing josé arcadio segundo and the latter also realized that the soldier was looking at him without seei ng him then he turned out the light and closed the door when he spoke to the soldiers aureliano segundo understood that the you ng officer had seen the roo m with the s ame eyes as colonel aureliano buendía “it’s obvious that no one has been in that room fo r at least a hundred years” the officer said to the soldiers “there must even be sna kes in there” when the d oor closed josé arcadi o segundo was sure tha t the war was over yea rs before colonel aureliano buendía had spoken to him about the fascination of war and had tried to show it to him with countless examples drawn from his ow n experience he had believed him but the night when the sol diers looked at him witho ut seeing hi m while he thought about the tension of the past few months the misery of jail the panic at the station and th e trai n loaded with dead people josé arcadio segundo reached the conclu sion that col onel aureliano buendía was not hing but a faker or an imbecile he could not understand why he had needed so many words to explain what he felt in war because one was enough fear in melquíad es’ room on the other hand protected by the supernatural light by the sound of the rain by th e feeling of being invisible he found the repose that he had not had for one single instant during his previous life and the only fear that remained was tha t they would bury him alive he told san ta sofía de la piedad about it when sh e brought him his daily meals and she promised to struggle to stay alive even beyond her na tural forces in order to make sure that th ey wo uld bury him dead free from all fear josé ar cadio segundo dedicated himself then to peruse th e manuscripts of melquíad es many times and with so much more pleasur e when he cou ld not understand them he becam e accustom ed to the sound of the rain which after two months had become another form of silence and the onl y thing that disturbed his solitude was the coming and going o f santa sofía de la piedad he asked her therefore to leave the meals on the windowsill and padlock the door the rest of the family forgot about him including fernanda who did not mind leaving him there when she found that the sold iers had seen him without recognizing him after six months of encl osure since the soldiers had left macon do aureliano segundo removed the padlock looking for someone he could talk to until the rain stopped as soon as he opened the door he felt the pes tilenti al attack of the cha mberpots which were placed on the floor and all of which had been used several times josé arcad io segundo devoured by baldness indifferent to the air that had been sharpened by the nauseating vapors was still reading and rereading the unintelligib le parchments he was illu minated by a seraphic glow he scarcely raised his eyes when he heard the door open but that look was enough for his brother to see repeated in it the irreparable fate of his greatgrandfather “there were more than three thousan d of them” was all that josé arcadio segundo said “i’m sure now tha t they were everybody wh o had been a t the sta tion” chapter it rained for four years eleven months and two days th ere were perio ds of drizzle during which everyone put on his full dress and a co nvalescent lo ok to celebra te the clearin g but the people soon grew accusto med to inter pret the paus es as a sign of redoubled rain the sk y crumbled i nto a set of destructive s torms and out of the north came hu rricanes that scattered ro ofs about and knocked down walls and uprooted every last plant of the ba nana groves just as during the insomnia plague as úrsula came to rem ember during those days the cala mity itself i nspired defenses against boredom aureliano segundo was one of those w ho worked hardest n ot to be co nquered b y idleness he had gone home for some minor m atter on th e night that mr brown unleashed th e storm and f ernanda tried to h elp him with a hal fblownout umbrella tha t she found i n a clos et “i don’t need it” he said “i’ll stay until it clears” that was not of course an ironclad promise but he would acco mplish it literally since his clothes were at petra c otes’s every three days h e would tak e off what he had on and wait in his shorts until they washed in order not to becom e bored he dedicated himself to the task of rep airing the m any things that needed fixing in the house he adjusted hinges oiled locks screwed knockers tigh t and planed doorjambs for several months h e was seen wandering about with a to olbox that the gypsies must have left behind in josé arcadi o buendía’s days and no one knew whether becaus e of the involuntary exercise the winter tedium or the imposed abstinence but his belly was deflating little by little like a wineskin and his face of a beatific tortoise was becoming less bloodshot and his double chin less prominent until he becam e less pachydermic all over and was able to tie his own shoes again watching him putting in latches and repairing clocks fernanda wondered whether or not he too might be falling into the vice of building so that he could take apart like colone l aureliano buendía and his little gold fishes amaranta and her shroud and her buttons josé arcadio and the parchm ents and úrsula and her memories b ut that was not th e case the worst part was that the rain was affecting ev erything and the driest of machines would have flowers popping out among their gears if they wer e not oiled every three days and the threads in brocades rusted and wet clothing would break out in a rash of saffroncolo red moss the air was so damp that fi sh could have come in through the doors and swum out th e windows floating through the atmo sphere in the rooms one morning úrsula woke up feeling that she was reaching her end in a pl acid swoon and she had already asked them to tak e her to father antonio isabel even if it had to b e on a stretcher when santa sofía de la piedad discovered that her ba ck was paved with leeches s he took them off one by one crushing them with a firebrand before they bled her to death it was n ecessary to dig canals to get the water out of the house and rid it of the frogs and snails so that they could dry the floors and take the bricks from under the bedposts and walk in shoes once more occupied with the many small details that call ed for his attention aureliano segundo did not realize that he was g etting old until one afternoon when he found himself contemplating the premature d usk from a rocking chair and thinking about petr a cotes witho ut quivering there would have been no problem in going back to fernanda’s insipid love because her beauty had beco me solemn with age but the rain had spared him from all emergencies of passion and had filled him with the spongy serenity of a lack of appetite he amused himself thinking about the things that he could ha ve done in other times with that rain which had already lasted a year he had been one of the first to bring zinc sheets to macondo much earlier than their p opularization by the ba nana compan y simply to roof petra cotes’s bedroom with them and to take pleasure in the feeling of deep intim acy that the sprinkling of the rain pro duced at tha t time but even those wil d memories of his mad yo uth left him unmoved just as during his last debauch he had exhausted his quota of salaciousne ss and all he had left was the marvelous gift of being able to remem ber it without bitterness or re pentance it might ha ve been tho ught that th e deluge had given him the opportunity to sit and refl ect and that the business of the pliers and the oilcan had a wakened in him the tard y yearning of so many useful trades that he might h ave followed in his life and did not but neither case was true because the tempta tion o f a sedentary domesticity that was bes ieging him was not the result of any re discovery or moral lesion it came from much farther off unearthed by the rain ’s pitchfork from the days when in melquíades’ room he would read the pro digious fables about flyin g carpets an d whales that fed on entir e ships and their crews it was during those days that in a moment of care lessness little aureliano ap peared on the porch and his grandfather recognized the secret of his identi ty he cut his hair dressed him taught him not to be afraid of people and very soon it was evident that he was a legitimate aureliano buendía with his high cheekbones his startled look and his solitary air it was a relief for fernanda for some time she had measured the extent of her pridefulness but she could not find any way to remedy i t because th e more she th ought of solutions the le ss rational they seem ed to her if she had known that aurelia no segundo was going to take thin gs the way he did with the fine pleasure of a grandfather she would n ot have taken so many turns or got so mixed up but would have freed herself from mortification the year before amar anta úrsula who already had her second teeth thought of her nephew as a scurry ing toy who was a consolation for the tedium of the rain aureliano segundo remembered th en the english en cyclopedi a tha t no one had sin ce touched in meme’s old room he began to show the children the pictures especia lly those of animals and later on the maps and photographs of remote countries and famous people si nce he did not know any english and could identify only the most famou s cities and people he would invent names and legends to satisfy the children’s insatiable curiosity fernanda really believed that her husband was wa iting for it to clear to return to his co ncubine during the first months of the rain she was afrai d that he wo uld try to slip into her b edroom and that she wo uld have to undergo the shame o f revealing to him that she was incapable of reconciliation since the birth of am aranta úrsula that was the reason for her anxious correspon dence with the invisible doctors interrupted by fr equent disasters of th e mail during the firs t months when it was lear ned that the trains were ju mping their tracks in the rain a letter from the invisible doctors told her that h ers were not arriving later on when con tact with th e unknown correspondents was broken she had seriously thought of putting on the tige r mask that her husband had worn in the bloody carnival and having hersel f examined under a fictitious name by the banan a company do ctors but on e of the man y people wh o regularly brought unpleasant n ews o f the delug e had told her that th e company was dismantling its dispensaries to move them to wh ere it was no t raining the n she gave up hope she resigned herself to waiting until the ra in stopped and the mail service was back to nor mal and in the meantim e she sought relief from her secret ailments with recourse to her imagination because she would rather have died than put herself in the hands of the only doctor l eft in macondo the extra vagant frenchman who a te grass like a donkey she drew close to úrsula trusting that she would know of some pa lliative for her attacks but her twisted habit of not calling things by their names made her put first things last and use “expelled” for “gave birth” and “burnin g” fo r “flow” so that it would all be less shameful with the result that ú rsula reached the reasonab le conclusion that her trouble was intesti nal rather than uterine and she advised her to take a dose of calomel on an empty stomach if it had not been for that suffering which would hav e had nothing shameful about it for someone who did not suffer as well fro m shamefulness and if it had not b een for the los s of the letters the rain would not have bothered fernanda because after all her whole life had been spent as if it had b een raining she did not change her schedule or modify her ritual when the table was still raised u p on bricks and the chairs put on pla nks so that those at the table woul d not get their feet wet she still served with linen tablecl oths and fine chinaware a nd with lighted candles because she fe lt that th e calamities should not be used as a pretext for any relaxation in customs no one went out into the street any more if it had depended on fernanda they would never have done so not onl y since it started raining but since long before that because she felt that doors had been invented to stay clo sed and that curiosity fo r what was going on in the street was a ma tter for harlots yet she was the f irst one to lo ok out when they wer e told that the funeral proc ession for colonel gerine ldo márquez was passing by and even though she only watched it through the halfopened window it left her in such a state of affliction that for a long time she rep ented in her weakness she could not have conceived of a more desolate co rtege they had put th e coffin in an oxcart over which they built a canopy of banana leaves but the press ure of the rain was so intense and the streets so m uddy that wi th every step the wheels got stuck and the cover ing was on the verge of falling apart the streams of sad water that fell on the coffin were soaking the flag that had been placed on to p which was actually th e flag staine d with blood and gunpowder that had b een rejected by more hon orable vetera ns on th e coffin they ha d also placed the saber with tass els of silver and copper the same one that colonel gerineldo márquez used to hang on the coat rack in order to go into am aranta’s sewing r oom unarmed behind th e cart so me barefoot an d all of them with their pants rolled up splashing in the mud were the last survivors of the surrender at neerlandia carrying a drover’s staff in one hand and in the other a wreath of p aper fl owers tha t had becom e discolored in the rain they appeared like an unreal vision alo ng the street which still bore the name of colonel aureliano buendía and they all looked at the ho use as they passed and turned the corner at the square where they had to ask for help to move th e cart which was stuck úrsula had herself carried to the door by santa sofía de la piedad she fo llowed the difficulties of the procession with such attention th at no one doubted that s he was seei ng it especially because he r raised hand of an archangelic messenger was moving with the swa ying of the cart “goodbye gerineldo my son” she shouted “say hello to my people and tell them i’ll see them when it stops raining” aureliano segundo helped her back to bed and with the same informality with which he always treated her he asked her th e meaning of her farewell “it’s true” she said “i’m only waiting for the rain to stop in order to die” the condition of the streets alarmed aureliano se gundo he finally became worried about the state of his animals and he threw an oilcloth ov er his head and sent to petra cotes’s house he found her in the courtyard in the water up to her waist trying to float the corpse of a horse aureliano segundo helped her with a lever and the enormous swollen body gave a turn like a bell and was dra gged away b y the torrent of liquid mud since the rain began all that petr a cotes had done was to clear her courtyard of dead animal s during the first weeks she sent messages to aureliano segundo for him to take ur gent measures and he had answered that there was no rush that the situ ation was not alarming that there wo uld be plenty of time to think about something when it cleared she sent him word that the horse pastures were being flooded that the cattle wer e fleeing to high ground where ther e was nothing to eat and where they were at th e mer cy of jaguars and sickness “there’s no thing to be d one” aure liano segundo answered her “others w ill be born when it cl ears” petra cates had s een them die i n dusters an d the was a ble to butch er only thos e stuck in the mud she saw with quiet impotence how the deluge was pitilessly exterminating a fortune that at one tim e was consi dered the la rgest and most solid in macondo and of which nothing remained but pestilence when aureliano se gundo decided to go s ee wha t was going on he found only t he corpse of the horse and a squalid mule in the ruins of the st able petra cotes watched him arrive without surprise joy or resentment a nd she only allowed herself an ironic smile “it’s about time” she said she had aged all skin and bones and her tapere d eyes of a car nivorous animal had become sad and tame from looking at the rain so much aureliano segundo stayed at her house more than three months not because he felt better there than in that of his family but because he n eeded all that time to make the decision to throw the piece of oilc loth back over his head “there’s no rush” he said as he had said in the other home “let’s hope th at it clears in the next few hours” during the course of the first week he became accustomed to th e inroads that time and th e rain had made in the health of his concubine and littl e by little he was seeing her as she had been before remembering her jubilant excesses and the delirious fertility that her love provoked in the animals and partly through love partly through interest one night du ring the second week he awoke her with urgent caresses petra cotes did not rea ct “go back to sleep” she murmured “these aren’ t times for things like t hat” aureliano segundo saw himself in the mirrors on the ceiling saw petra cotes’s spinal column like a row of spools st rung together along a cluster of withered nerves a nd he saw that sh e was right not b ecause of th e times but because of themselves w ho were n o longer up to those things aureliano segundo returned home with his trunks convinced that not only úrsula but all the inhabitants o f macondo were waiting for it to dea r in order to die he had seen th em a s he pass ed by sitting in their parlors with an a bsorbed l ook and folde d arms feeling unbroke n time pass relentless times because it was usele ss to divide it into months and years and the days into hours when one could do nothing but contemplate the rain the children greeted aureliano segundo with excitemen t because he wa s playing the asthmatic acco rdion for t hem again but the concerts did not attract th eir attention a s much as the sessions with the en cyclopedia and once m ore they got together in meme’s room where aureliano segundo’ s imagination chang ed a dirigible into a flying elephant wh o was looking for a place to sleep a mong the cloud s on one occasion he came across a man on horseback who in spite of his strange ou tfit had a fa miliar look and after examining him closely he ca me to the co nclusion that it was a picture of colonel aureliano buendía he showed it to fernanda and she also admitted th e resemblan ce of the horseman not only to the colonel but to everybody in the family although he was actually a tartar warrior time passed in that way with the colossus of rhodes and snake charmers until his wi fe told hi m that there were only three pounds of dried meat and a sack of rice left in the pantry and what do you want me to do abou t it” he asked “i don’t kno w” fernand a answered “that’s men’s business” “well” aure liano segundo said “something will be done when it clears” he was more interested i n the encyclopedia than in the dom estic problem even wh en he had to content hims elf with a scr ap of meat a nd a little rice for lunch “it’s impossible to do anything now” he would sa y “it can’t rain for the rest of our lives” and while the urgencies of the pantry grew greater fernanda’s indignation also grew until her eventual protests her infrequent outbursts cam e forth in an uncontained unchained torrent that begin one morning like the monotonous drone of a guitar and as the day adv anced rose i n pitch ri cher and more splendid au reliano segundo was not aware of the singsong until the fo llowing day after breakfast wh en he felt hi mself being bothered b y a buzzing that was by th en more fluid and louder than the so und of the rain and it was fernanda who was wal king throughout the hous e complainin g that they h ad raised her to be a queen only to have her end up as a servant in a madhouse with a lazy idolatrous libertine husband who lay on his back waiting for bread to rain down from heaven while she wa s straining her kidneys trying to keep afloat a h ome held together with pins where ther e was so mu ch to do so much to b ear up under and repair from the time god gave his morning su nlight until it was ti me to go to bed that when she got there her eyes were full of ground glass an d yet no on e ever said to her “good morning fernanda did you sleep well” nor had they asked her even out of courtesy why she was so pale or why she awo ke with purple rings under her eyes in spite of the fact that she expected it of course from a family that had al ways considered her a nuisance an old rag a booby painted on the wall and who were always going a round saying things again st her behind her back c alling her church mouse calling her pharisee calling her cra fty and even a maranta may she rest in peace had said aloud that she was one of those people who co uld not tell their rectums from their ashes god have mercy such words and she had tolerated everything with resignation b ecause of th e holy fath er but sh e had not been able to to lerate it any more when that evil josé arcadio segundo said that the damnation o f the family had come when it open ed its doors to a stuckup highlander just imagine a bossy highlander lord save us a highlander daug hter of evil spit of the sa me s tripe as th e highlanders the government sent to kill workers you tell me and he was referring to no one but her the godchild of the duke of alba a lady of such lin eage that s he made th e liver of presidents’ wives quiver a noble dame of fine blood like her who had the right to si gn eleven peninsular names and who was the only mortal creature in that to wn full of bastards who did not feel all conf used at th e sight of sixteen pieces of silverware so that her adulterous husband could die of laughter afterward and say that so many knives and forks and s poons were not meant for a human being but for a centipede and the only o ne who coul d tell with her eyes closed when the white wine wa s served and on what side and in which glass and when the red wi ne and on what side and in which glass and not like that pea sant of an amaranta ma y she rest in peace who thought that wh ite wine was served in the daytim e and red wine at night and the only o ne on the whole coast who could take pride in the fact tha t she took care o f her bodily needs only i n golden chamberpots s o that colonel aureliano buendía may he rest in peace could have the effrontery to ask her with his masonic ill humor where she had received that privilege and wheth er sh e did not shit shit but shat sweet basil just imagine with those very words and so that re nata her own daughter who through an oversight had seen her stool in the bedroom had answered that even if the pot was al l gold and with a co at of arms what was inside was pure sh it physical shit and worse even th an any other kind because it was stuckup highland shit just imagine her own daug hter so that she never had any illusions about th e rest of the f amily but in any cas e she had th e right to expect a little mor e considerati on from her husband because for better or for worse he wa s her consecr ated spouse her helpmate her legal despoiler who took upon himself of his own fr ee and sovereign will the grave responsibility of taking her away from her paternal home where sh e never wanted for or suffered from anything where she wove funeral wreaths as a pastime since her godfather had sent a letter with his signature and the stamp of his ring on the sealing wax simply to say that the hands of his goddaughter were not mean t for tasks of this world except to pl ay the clavichord and nevertheless her insane husband had taken her from her home with all manner of admonitions and warnings and had brought her to that frying pan of hell where a person could not breathe b ecause of th e heat an d before she h ad completed her pentecostal fast h e had gone off with his wandering trunks and his wastrel’s accordion to loaf in adultery with a wretc h of whom it was only enough to see her behind well that’s been said to see her wiggle her mare’s behind in order to guess that she was a that sh e was a just the opposite of her who wa s a lady in a palace or a pigsty at the table or in bed a lady of breeding godfearing obeying his laws and submissi ve to his wishes and with whom he could not perform naturally the acrobatics and trampish antics that he did with the other one who of course was ready fo r anything like the french matrons a nd even wor se if one co nsiders well because they at least had the honesty to put a red light at their door swinishness like that just imagine and tha t was all that was needed by the o nly and beloved daughter of doña renata arg ote and do n fernando del carpio and especially the latter a n upright man a fine christian a knight of the order of the holy sepulcher those who receive di rect from g od the privilege of remai ning intact in their graves with their skin smooth like the cheek s of a bride and their eyes alive and clear like emeralds “that’s not true” aureliano segundo interrupted her “he wa s already beg inning to smell when they brought him here” he had th e patience to listen to h er for a whole d ay until he caug ht her in a sli p fernanda did not pay him any mind but sh e lowered her voice that night at dinner the exas perating buzzing of the singsong had conquered the sound of the rain au reliano segundo ate very little with his head down and he went to his room early at breakfast on the following day fernanda was trembling with a look of not having slept well and she seemed completely exhausted by her rancor never theless when her husband asked if it was not possi ble to have a softboiled egg she did not answer simply that they had run out of eggs the week bef ore but she worked up a violent diatribe against men who spent th eir tim e contemplating their navels and then had the gall to ask for larks’ livers at the table aureliano segundo took the children to look at the encyclopedia as alwa ys an d fernanda pretended to straighten o ut meme’s r oom just so that h e coul d listen to her muttering of course that it certai nly took cheek for him to tell the poor innocents that there was a picture of colonel aureliano b uendía in the encycloped ia during th e afternoon while the chi ldren were having their nap aureliano segundo sat on the porch and fernan da pursued him even there provoking him tormenting him hovering about him with her impl acable hor sefly buzzing saying that of course while there was nothing to eat except stones her husband was sitting there like a sultan of persia watching it rain because that was all he was a sl ob a sponge a goodfornot hing softer than cotton batting used to living off women and convinced th at he had married jonah’s wife who was so content with the story of the whale aureliano segundo listened to her for more than two hours impassive as if he were deaf he did not interrupt her until late in the after noon when he could no longer bear the echo of the bass drum that was tormenting his head “please shut up” he begged fernanda quite the con trary raised her pitch “i don’t have any reason to shut up” she said “anyone who doesn’t want to listen to me can go someplace else” then aureliano segundo lost control he stood up un hurriedly as if he only intended to stretch and wi th a perfectly regulated and methodi cal fury he grabbed the p ots with th e begonias one after the oth er those with the ferns the oregano and one after the other he smashe d them onto the floor fernanda was frightened because unti l then sh e had really no t had a clea r indication of the tremen dous inner force of her singsong but it was too late for any attempt at rect ification intoxicated by the uncontain ed torrent of relief aureliano segundo broke the glass on the china closet and piece by piece witho ut hurrying he took ou t the chinaware and sh attered it on th e floor systematically serenely in the same parsimonious way in whi ch he had papered the house with ba nknotes he then set abo ut smashing the bohemia n crystal war e against the walls the ha ndpainted vases the pictures of maidens in flow erladen boats the mirrors in their gilded frames everything that was brea kable from parlor to pantry and he finished with the large earthen jar in the kitchen which exploded in the middle of the courtyard wi th a hollow boom then he washed his hands threw the oil cloth over himself and before midnight he return ed with a few strings of dried meat s everal bags of rice corn with weevils and some emaciated bu nches of bananas from then on there was no mor e lack of food amaranta úrsula and little aureliano would rem ember the rains as a ha ppy time in spite of fernanda’s strictness they would splash in the pu ddles in the courtyard ca tch lizards a nd dissect them and pretend that they were poisoning the soup with dust from butterfly wings when santa sofía de la piedad was not looking úrsula was their most amusing plaything they looked upon her as a big brokendown doll that they carried back and forth from one corner to another wrapped in colored cloth and with h er face p ainted with soot and annatto and once they were on the point of plucking out her eyes with the prun ing shears as they had done with the frogs nothing gave them as much excitement as the wanderings of her mind something indeed must have happened to her mind during the third yea r of the rain for she was gradually losing her sense of reality and confusing present time with remote periods of her life to the point where on one occasion she spent three days weepin g deeply over the dea th of petronila ig uarán her greatgrandmother buried for over a century she sank into such an insane state of co nfusion that she thought little aureliano was her son the colo nel during the time he wa s taken to see ice and th at the josé arcadio who was at tha t time in the s eminary was her firs tborn who had gone off with the gy psies s he spoke so much about the family that the children learned to make up imaginary visits with beings who had not only been dead for a l ong time but who had existed at diffe rent times sitting on the bed her hair covered with ashes and her face wrapped in a red kerchi ef úrsula was happy in the midst of the unreal relatives wh om the child ren describe d in all detail as if they ha d really known them úrsula would converse with her forebears about events that to ok place before her own existence enjoying the news they ga ve her and she would weep with th em over deaths that were much more recent than the guests themselves the children did not take long to notice that in the course of those ghostly visits úrsula would always ask a question destined to establis h the one who had brought a lifesize plaster saint joseph to the house to be kept until the rains stopped it was in that way that aureliano segundo remembered the fortune b uried in some place that only úrsula knew but th e questions a nd astute ma neuvering that occurred to him were of no use becaus e in the labyr inth of her madness she seemed to pr eserve enough of a margin of lucidi ty to keep the s ecret which s he would reveal only to the one who could prove that he was the real owner of the buried gold she was so skillful and strict that wh en aureliano segundo instructed one of hi s carousing companions to pass himself off as the owner of the fortune she got him all caught up in a minute inter rogation sown with subtle traps convinced that úrsula would carry the secret to her grave aureliano segundo hired a crew of diggers under the pretext that they were making so me drainage canals in the courtya rd and the backyard and he himsel f took soundings in th e earth with iron bars and all manner of metal detectors without finding anything th at resembled gold in three months of exhaustive exploration later on he went to pilar ternera with the hop e that the cards would we m ore than the diggers but she began b y explaining that an y attempt would be useless unl ess úrsula cut the cards on the other hand she confirmed the existence of the treas ure with the precision of its consisting of seven thousand two hundred f ourteen coin s buried in th ree canvas sacks reinf orced with copper wire within a circle with a rad ius of three hundred ei ghtyeight feet with úrsula’s bed as th e center but she warned that it woul d not be found until it stopped raining and the sun s of three consecutive junes had changed the piles of mu d into dust the profusion and meticulous vagueness of the information seemed to aureliano segundo so similar to the tales of spiritualists that he kept on with his enterprise in spite of the fact that they were in august and they wo uld have to wait a t least three years in ord er to satisfy the co nditions of the pr ediction the first thing that startled him even though it increased his confusion at the same time was the fact that it was precisely three hundred eightyeight feet from úrsula’s bed to the ba ckyar d wall fernanda feared that he was a s crazy as his twin brother when she saw him taking the measurem ents and even more when he told the digging crew to make the ditches three feet deeper overco me by an exploratory delirium comparable only to tha t of his greatgrandfather wh en he was s earchi ng for the route of inventions aureliano segun do lost the last layers of fat that he had left and the old resemblance to his twin brother wa s becoming accentu ated ag ain not onl y because of his slim figure but also because of the distant air and the with drawn attitu de he no longer bothered with the children he ate at odd hours muddled from head to toe and he did so in a corner in the kitchen barely answering the occasional questions asked by santa sofía de la piedad seeing him work that way as she had never dreamed him capabl e of doing fernanda thoug ht that his stubbornness was diligence his greed abnegation and his thick headedness perseverance and her insides tightened with remo rse over the virulence with which she had attacked his idleness but aureliano segundo was in no mood for merciful reconciliations at that time sunk u p to his neck in a moras s of dead br andies and r otting flowers he flung the dirt of th e garden all about after having finished with the courtyard and the backyard and he excavated so deeply under the foundations of the east wing of the house that one night they woke up in terror at what seem ed to be an earthquake as much beca use of the trembling as the fearful underground creaking three of the rooms were collapsing and a frightening crack had opened up from the porch to fernanda’s room aureliano segundo did not give up the search because of that even when his last hopes had been exti nguished and the only thin g that seemed to mak e any sens e was what the cards had p redicted he reinforced the jagged fo undation repaired the crack with mortar and continued on the side to the west he was still the re on the second week of the following june when the rain began to abate an d the clouds began to lif t and it was obvious from one moment to the next that it was going to clear that was what happ ened on friday at two in the afterno on the worl d lighted up wi th a crazy crimson sun as harsh as bric k dust and al most as cool as water and it did not rain again for ten years macondo was in ruins in the s wampy streets there were the rem ains of furniture animal skeletons covered with red lilies the last memor ies of the hordes of newcomers who had fled macondo as wildly as th ey had arrived the houses that had been built with such haste during the banana fever had been abandoned the ban ana compan y tore down i ts installatio ns all tha t remained of the former wiredin city were the r uins the wooden houses the cool terraces for breezy cardplaying afternoons seemed to have been blown away in an anticipation of the propheti c wind that years later wou ld wipe macondo off the face of the earth the o nly human trace left b y that voracio us blast was a glove bel onging to patr icia brown in an automobile smothered in wild pansies the enchanted region explored by josé ar cadio buendí a in the d ays of the foun ding where later on the banana plantations flourished was a bog of rotting roots on the horizon of which one could manage to see the silent foam of the sea aureliano segundo went through a crisis of affliction on the first sunday that he put on d ry clothes and went ou t to renew his acquaintan ce with the town the s urvivors of the catastrop he the s ame ones who had been living in macondo before it had been struck by th e banana comp any hurrican e were sittin g in the mid dle of the s treet enjoying their first sunshine they still had the green of th e algae on their skin and the musty smell of a corner that had been stamped on them by the rain but in their hearts they seemed ha ppy to have recovered th e town in which they ha d been born the street of the turks was again what it h ad been earlier in the days when the ar abs with s lippers and rings in their ears were going about the world swapping knickkna cks for macaws and had fo und in macondo a good bend in the road where they could fi nd respite from their ageold lot as wa nderers having crossed through to the other side of the rain the merchand ise in the bo oths was fall ing apart the cloths spread over the doors were splotched wi th mold th e counters un dermined by ter mites th e walls eaten away by da mpness but the arabs of the third generation wer e sitting in th e same pla ce and in the same position as their fathers and grandfathers taciturn dau ntless invulnerab le to time and disas ter as alive or as dead as they had been after the insomnia plague and colonel aureliano buendía’s thirtytwo wars their strength of spirit in the face of ruins of the gaming tables the fri tter stands the shooting galleries and the alley where th ey interpreted d reams and p redicted th e future made aureliano segundo ask them with hi s usual informality what mysterious resources they had relied upon so as not to hav e gone awash in the storm what the dev il they had done so as not to drown and one after the other from door to door they returned a crafty smile and a drea my look an d without a ny previous consultation they all gave the answer “swimming” petra cotes was perhaps the only native who had an arab heart she had seen the fina l destruction of her stables her ba rns dragged off by the stor m bu t she had managed to keep her house standi ng during the second year she had sent pressing messages to aureliano segundo and he had answered that he did not know when he woul d go back to her house but that in any case h e would bring along a box of gold coins to pave the bedroom floor with a t that time s he had dug deep into her heart searching for the strength th at would allow her to survive the misfortune and she had discovered a reflective and just rage with which she had sworn to restore the fortune squandered by her lover and then wiped out by the deluge it was such an unbreakable decision that aureliano segundo went back to her house eight mont hs after the las t message and fou nd her green disheveled with sunken eyelids and s kin spangled with mange but she was writing out numbers on small pieces of paper to make a raffle aureliano segundo was astonished and he was s o dirty and so solemn that petra cotes almost believed that the one who had come to see her was not the lover of all her life but his twin brother “you’re crazy” he told her “unless y ou plan to raffle off bones” then she told him to look in the bedroom and aureliano segundo saw the mule its skin was clinging to its bones like that of its mistress but it was just as al ive and re solute as she p etra cotes had fed it wi th her wrath and when there was no more hay or corn or roots she had given it shelter in her own bedroom an d fed it on the percale sh eets th e persian rugs the plush bedspreads th e velvet drapes and the can opy em broidered with gold thread and silk tassels on the episco pal bed chapter úrsula had to make a great effort to fulfill her prom ise to die when it cleared the waves of lucidity that were so scar ce during the rains beca me more frequent after august when an and wi nd began to blow and suffocated th e rose bushes and petrified the piles of mud and ended u p scattering over macondo the burning dust that cove red the rusted zinc roofs and the ageold almond trees forever úrsula cried in lamenta tion when s he discovered that for m ore than thr ee years she had been a plaything for the children she washed he r painted face took off the strips of brightly colored cloth the dried l izards and frogs and the rosaries and old arab necklaces tha t they had hung all over her body and fo r the first ti me since the death of amaranta sh e got up out o f bed withou t anybody’s help to join in the family life once m ore the spirit of her in vincible heart guided her through the shadows those who noticed her stumbling and who bumped into the archa ngelic arm she kept raised at head level thought that she was having troub le with her body but they still did not think she was blind she did not need to see to rea lize that th e flower beds cultivated wi th such car e since the first rebuilding had been destroyed b y the rain and ruined by aureliano segundo’s excavations and that the walls and th e cemen t of the floors were cracked the furniture mushy and discolored the doors off their hinges and the family menaced by a spirit of resigna tion and despair that was in conceivable in her time feeling her way along through the empty b edrooms she perceived th e continuous rumble of the termites a s they carved the wood the snipping of the moths in the clothes closets and the devastating noise of the enormous red ants that had prospered during the deluge and were undermining the foundations of the house one day s he opened the trunk with the saints an d had to ask santa sofía de la piedad to get off her body the cockroaches that jumped out and that had alread y turned th e clothing to d ust “a pers on can’t live in neglect like this” she said “if we go on like this we’ll be devoured by an imals” from then on she did not have a moment of repose up before dawn she would use anybody available even the ch ildren she put the few articles of clothing that were still us able out into the sun s he drove the cockroaches off with powerful insecticide atta cks she scratched out th e veins that the termites had made o n doors and windows and asphyxiated the ants in their anthills with quicklime the fever of restora tion finally brought her to the forgotten rooms she cleared ou t the rubble and cobwebs in the room where josé arcadio buendía had lost his wits looking for th e philosopher’s stone she put the silver shop which had been up set by th e soldiers in order and lastly she asked for the keys to melquíades’ room to see what state it was in faith ful to the wishes of josé arcadio seg undo who had forbidden anyone to come in unless there was a clear indica tion that h e had died santa sofía de la piedad tried all kinds of subterfuges to throw úrsula off the tra ck but so inflexible was h er determin ation not to surrender even the most remote cor ner of the h ouse to the insects that s he knocked down ever y obstacle in h er path and after three days of in sistence she su cceeded in g etting them to open the door for her she had to hold on to the doorjamb so tha t the s tench would not knock h er over but she needed only two seconds to remember that the schoolgirls’ seventytwo chamberpots were in there and tha t on one of the rainy nights a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking fo r josé arcadio segundo and had been unabl e to find him “lord save us” she exclaimed as if she coul d see everything “so much trouble teach ing you good manners and you end up living like a pig” josé arcadio segundo was still rea ding over th e parchments the on ly thing visible in the intricate tan gle of hair was the teeth striped with green dime and his motionless eyes when h e recognized h is greatgrandmother’s voice he turned his head toward th e door tried to smile and without knowing it repeated an old phrase of úrsula’s “what did you expect” he murmured “time passes” “that’s how it goes” úrsula said “but not so much” when she said it she realized that she was givi ng the same reply that colonel aureliano buendía had given in his death cell and once again she shuddered with the evidence that time was not passing as she had just admitted but that it was tu rning in a circle but even then she did not give resignation a chance she scolded josé arcadio segu ndo as if he were a child and insisted that he take a bath and shave and lend a hand in fixing up the house the simple idea of abandoning the room that h ad given him peace ter rified josé arcadio segundo he shouted tha t there was n o human power capable of making hi m go out b ecause h e did not wan t to see the tr ain with two hundred cars loaded with dead people which left macondo every day at dusk on its way to the sea “they were all of those who were at the station” he shouted “three thousand four hundred eight” only th en di d úrsula realize th at he was in a worl d of shadows more impenetrable than hers as un reachable an d solitary as that of his greatgrandfat her she left him in the room but she succeeded in getting them to leave th e padlock off clean it every day thro w the ch amberpots awa y except for one and to keep josé arcadio segundo as clean an d presentable as his greatgrandfather had been during his long captivity under th e chestnut tree at first f ernanda interpreted tha t bustle as an attack of senile madness and it was difficult for he r to suppress her exasperation but about that time josé arcadio told her th at he planned to come to macondo from rome befor e taking his final vows and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that from morning to night she would be seen watering the flowers four times a day s o that her so n would not have a bad impression of the house it was that s ame incentive which ind uced her to speed up her correspondence with the invisible doctors and to replace th e pots of ferns and oreg ano and the begonias on the porch even before úrsula found out that they had been destroyed by aureliano segundo’s ext erminating fury later on she sold the silver servic e and bought ceramic dishes pewter bowls and soup spoons and alpaca tablecloths and with them brought poverty to th e cupboard s that had been accus tomed to india company chinaware and bohemian crystal úrsula always tried to go a step beyond “open the windows and the doors” she shouted “cook some me at and fish buy the largest turtles around let strangers come and spread their mats in the corners and urinate in the rose bushes and sit down to eat as many times as they want and belch and ra nt and muddy everything with their boots and let them do wh atever they want to us because th at’s the only way to drive o ff rain” but it was a vain illusion she was too old then and living on borrowed time to repeat the m iracle of the little candy animals and none of her descendants had inher ited her strength the house stayed closed on fernanda’s orders aureliano segundo who had taken his trunks ba ck to the house of petra cotes barely h ad enough mea ns to see th at the family did not starve to death with the raffling of the mule petra cotes and he bought some more animals with which they managed to set up a primitive lotter y business aureliano segundo would go from ho use to house selling the tickets that he himself painted with colored ink to make th em more at tractive and convincing and perhaps he did not realize that many people bought them out of gratit ude and m ost of them out of pity nevertheless even the mo st pitying purchaser was getting a ch ance to win a pig for twenty cen ts or a calf for thirtytwo and they became so hopef ul that on t uesday nights petra cotes’s courtyard overflowed with people waiting for the moment when a child picked at random drew the winning number from a bag it did not take long to become a weekly fair for at dus k food and drink stands would be s et up in the courtyard and many of those who were favored would slaughter the animals they had wo n right there o n the conditi on that som eone else su pply the liqu or and mu sic so tha t without having wanted to aureliano segundo suddenly found himself playing the accordion again and participating in modest to urneys of voracity those humble replic as of the revelry of former times served to show aureliano segundo himself how much his spirits ha d declined and to what a degree his skill as a masterful carouser had dried up he was a changed man the two hundred forty pounds that he had attained during the days when he ha d been challenged by the elephant had been reduced to one hundred fiftysix the glowing and blo ated tortoise fa ce had turn ed into that of an iguana and h e was always on th e verge of boredom and fatigue for petra cotes however he had never been a better man than a t that time p erhaps becaus e the pity tha t he inspired was mixed with love and because of the feeling o f solidarity that misery aroused in both of them t he brokend own bed ceased to be the scene of wild activities and was chan ged into an intimate refuge freed of the repetiti ous mirrors which had been au ctioned off to buy animals for th e lottery an d from the l ewd damasks and velvets which the mule had eaten they would stay up very late with the i nnocence of two sleepless grandparents taking advantage of the time to dr aw up accounts and put away pennies which they formerly wasted just for the sake of it sometimes the cock’s crow would find them piling and unpiling coin s taking a bit away from here to put th ere to that this bunch would be enough to keep fernanda happy and that would be for amaranta úr sula’s sho es and that other one for santa sofía de la piedad who had not had a new dress since the ti me of all the noise and this to order the coffin if úrsula died and this for the coffee which wa s going up a cent a pou nd in price every three months and this for the sugar which sweeten ed less every day and this for the lumber which was still wet from the rains and this other one for the paper and the colored ink to make tickets wi th and what wa s left over to pay off the winner of the april calf whose hide they had miraculously saved when it came down with a symptomatic carb uncle just when all of the numbers in the raffle had already been sold those rites of poverty were so pure that they nea rly always set aside th e largest share for fernanda and th ey did not do so out of remo rse or charity but becau se her well being was m ore importa nt to them than their o wn what was really happening to them although neither of th em realized i t was tha t they both tho ught of fernanda as the daughter tha t they would have liked to have and never did to the point wh ere on a certain occasion they resigned themselves to ea ting crumbs for three days so that she co uld buy a dutch tableclo th nevertheless no ma tter how much they killed themselves with work no matter how much money th ey eked out and no matter ho w many sch emes they thou ght of their guar dian angels were asleep with fatigue while they put in coins and took them out trying to get just enough to live with during the waking hours when the accounts were bad they wondered what had happened in the world for the animals not to breed with the sam e drive as before why m oney slipped through their fingers and why p eople who a sho rt time before had burned rolls of bills in the carousi ng considered it highway robbery to charge twelve cents for a raffle of six hens aureliano segundo thought without saying so that th e evil was not i n the world b ut in some hidden place in the mys terious heart of petra cotes where so mething had happened du ring the deluge that had turned the an imals sterile and made money scarce intrigued by that enigma he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found lo ve becaus e by trying to make her lov e him he ended up falling in love with her petra cotes for her part loved him more an d more as she felt his lov e increasing and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superst ition that poverty was the servitude of love both looked back then on th e wild revel ry the gaud y wealth an d the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to fund the paradise of shared solitude madly in love after so many year s of sterile complicity they enjoyed the miracle of loving each other as much at the tabl e as in bed and they grew to be so h appy tha t even when th ey were two wornout old people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs the raffles never got very far at first aure liano segundo would spend three days of the week shut up in w hat had been his rancher’s office dra wing ticket after ticket painti ng with a fair s kill a red cow a green pig or a group of blue hens according to the animal being raffled a nd he woul d sketch out a good imitation of printed numbers and the name that petra cotes thought good to call the business divine providence raffles but with tim e he felt so tir ed after dra wing up to two thousand tickets a week that he ha d the animal s the name and the num bers put on rubber stamps and then the work wa s reduced to moistening them on pads of different colors in his la st years it occurred to him to substitute riddles for the numbers so that the prize could be shared by all of those who guessed it b ut the system turned out to be so complicated and was open to so much suspicion that he gave it up after the second attemp t aureliano segundo was so busy tryin g to maintai n the prestig e of his raffles that h e barely had time to see the children fernanda put amaranta úrsula in a small private school where they admitted onl y six girls but she refused to allow aureliano to go to public school she considered that sh e had already relented to o mu ch in letting him leave the room besi des the schools in those days accep ted only the legitimate offspring of catho lic marriages and on the birth certificate tha t had been pinned to aureliano’s clothing when th ey brought him to the house he was registered as a foundling so he remained shut in at the mercy of santa sofía de la piedad’s loving eyes and úrsula’s mental quirks learning in the narrow world of th e house whatever his grandmothers explained to him he was delicate thi n with a curiosity that unnerved the adults but u nlike the inq uisitive and sometimes clairvoyant look that th e colonel had at his age his look was blinking and somewhat distracted while amar anta úrsula was in kinderga rten h e would hunt earthworms and torture insects in th e garden but once when fernanda ca ught him putting scorpions in a b ox to put in úrsula’s bed she locked him up in meme’s old room where he spent hi s solitary hours looking through the pictures in the ency cloped ia úrsula found him ther e one afternoon when she was going about sprinkling the house with distil led water an d a bunch o f nettles an d in spite of the fact tha t she had been with him m any times sh e asked him who he was “i’m aureliano buendía” he said “that’s right ” she replied “and now it’s time fo r you to start learning how to be a silversmith” she had confused him with her son again because the hot wi nd that cam e after the deluge and had brought occasional waves of lucidity to úrsul a’s brain had passed she never got her reason back when she went in to the bedro om she found petronila iguarán there with the bothersome crinolines and the beaded jacket that she put on fo r formal visit s and she fo und tranquilina maria miniata alacoque buendía her grandmother fanning herself w ith a peacock fe ather in her in valid’s rocking chair and her greatgrandfather aureliano arcadio buendía with his imitation dolman of the viceregal guard and aureliano iguarán her fa ther who had invented a prayer to make the worms shrivel up and dr op off cows and her tim id mother a nd her cousin with the p ig’s tail and josé arcadio buendía and her dead s ons all sitting in chairs lined up against the wall as if it were a wake and not a visit she was tying a colorful stri ng of chatter to gether com menting on things from many separate places and many different times so that when amaranta úrs ula returned from school and aureliano grew tired of the encyclopedia they would find her sitting on her bed talking to herself and lost in a labyrinth of dead people “f ire” she shouted once in terror and for an instant panic spread through the house but what she was telling abo ut was the burning o f a barn that she had witnessed when she was four yea rs old she fina lly mixed up the pas t with the present in such a way that in the two or three waves of lucidity that she had before she died no one knew for certai n whether she was speaki ng about what she felt or what she remembered little by little she wa s shrinking turning into a fetus becom ing mummified in life to the point that in her last months s he was a cherry raisin lost inside of her nightgown and the arm th at she al ways kept raised l ooked like the paw of a marimonda monkey she was motionl ess for several days and santa sofía de la piedad had to sh ake her to convince herself that she wa s alive and s at her on her lap to feed her a fe w spoonfuls of sugar water she looked like a newb orn old woman amaranta úrsula and aureliano would take her in and out of the bedroom they would lay her on the altar to see if she was any larger than the christ chi ld and one afternoon they hid her in a closet in the pantry where the rats could have eaten h er on e palm sund ay th ey went into th e bed room while fernanda wa s in church and carried úrsula out by the neck an d ankles “poor greatgreatgrand mother” amaranta úrsula said “sh e died of old age” úrsula was startled “i’m alive” s he said “you can see” amaranta úrsula said suppressing her laughter “that she’s not even breathing” “i’m talking ” úrsula sho uted “she can’t even talk” aureliano said “she died like a little cricket” then úrsula gave in to the evidence “my god” sh e exclaimed in a low voice “so this is what it’s like to be dead” she started an en dless stumb ling deep prayer that lasted more than two days and that by tuesday had degenerated into a hodg epodge of requests to god and bits of practical advice to s top the red ants from bringing the hous e down to keep th e lamp burning by remedios’ daguerreotype and never to let any buendía marry a person of the same blood because thei r children would be born with the tai l of a pig aureliano segundo tried to take advantage of her delirium to get her to ten him where the gold wa s buried but his entreaties were useless once mor e “when the owner appears” úrsula said “god will illumi nate him so that he will find it” santa sofía de la piedad had the certa inty that they would fi nd her dead from one moment to the next because she noticed during those days a certai n confusion in nature the roses smelled like goosefoot a pod of chick peas fell down an d the b eans lay on the gr ound in a perfect geometrical pattern i n the sh ape of a starfish and one night she saw a r ow of luminous orange disks pass across the sky they found her dead on the morning of good frid ay the last time tha t they had helped her calculate her age during the time of the banana company she had estimated it as between one hundred fifteen and one hundred twentytwo they buri ed her in a coffin that was not much larger than the bas ket in which aureliano had arrived an d very few people were at the fu neral partly because th ere wet not many left who remembered her and partly because it was so hot that noon that the bird s in their co nfusion were running in to walls like

influence of the wa ndering jew whom h e himself had seen the night before he described him as a cross between a billy goat and a female heretic an infernal beast whose breath scorched the air and whose look brought on the birth of monsters in newlywed women there were not many who paid attention to his apocalyptic talk for the town wa s convinced th at the priest was ramblin g because of his age but one woman woke ev erybody up a t dawn on wednesday because she found the tracks of a biped with a cloven hoof they were so clear and unmistakable that those who went to look at them had no doubt about the existence of a fearsome creature similar to the one described by the parish priest an d they got together to set traps in their courtyards that was how they managed to capture it two weeks a fter úrsula’s death petra cotes and aureliano segundo woke up frightened by the especi ally loud bellowing of a calf that was coming from nearby when they got there a group of men were already pulling the mon ster off the sharpened stakes they had set in the bottom of a pi t covered with dry leaves and it stopped lowing it was as hea vy as an ox in spite of the fact that it was no taller than a youn g steer and a green and greasy liquid flowed fro m its wounds its body was covered with rough hair plagued with small ticks and the skin was hardened with the scales of a remora fish but unlike the priest’s description its human parts were m ore like those of a sickly an gel than of a man for its hands were tense and agile its eyes large and gloomy and on its shoulder blades it had the scarredover and calloused stumps of powerful wings which mus t have been chopped off by a woods man’s ax they hung it to an almond tree in the sq uare by its a nkles so that everyone co uld see it an d when it b egan to ro t they burned it in a bonfire for they could not dete rmine whether its bastar d nature was that of an animal to be thrown into the river or a human being to be buried it was never established whether it had really caused th e death of the b irds but the newly married women di d not bear the predicted monsters nor did the intens ity of the heat decreas e rebeca died at the end of that year argénida he r lifelong servant asked th e authorities for help to knock do wn the door to th e bedr oom where her mistress had been locked in for three days and they found her on her solitary bed curled up like a shrimp wit h her head b ald from rin gworm and her finger in her mouth aureliano segundo took charge of the funera l and tried to restore the house in order to sell it but the destruction was so far advanced in it that the walls became scaly as soon as they were pa inted and th ere was no t enough mortar to stop the weeds from cracking the floors and the ivy from rotting the beams that was ho w everything went after the deluge the indolence of the people was in co ntrast to the voracity of oblivion which little by little was un dermining memories in a pitiless way to such an extreme that at that time on another anniversary of the treaty of neerlandia some emissaries from the presiden t of the rep ublic arrived in macond o to award at last the d ecoration rej ected several times by colonel aureliano buendía and they sp ent a whole afternoon looking for someone who could tell th em wh ere th ey could find one of hi s descend ants aureliano segundo wa s temp ted to accept it thi nking that it was a meda l of solid go ld but petra cotes convinced him th at it was not proper when the emissaries already had some proclamations an d speeches ready for the ceremony it was also around that tim e that the gypsies return ed the las t heirs to melq uíades’ scien ce and they found the town so defeated and its inhabitants s o removed from the rest of the world that once more they went through the houses d ragging magnetize d ingots as if that really were the babylonian wise men’s latest discov ery and once again they concen trated the su n’s rays with the giant magnifying glass and there was no lack of peopl e standing openmouthed watching kettles fall and pots roll and who paid fifty cents to be startled a s a gypsy woman put in her false teeth

intransigent audacious daring who personally rang the bells several times a day so that the peopl es spirits wo uld not get drowsy and who wen t from house to house waki ng up the sleepers to go to mass but b efore a year was out he too was conquered by the negligence that one brea thed in with the air by the hot dust that mad e everything old and clogged up and by the drowsiness caused by lunchtime meatballs in the unbearab le heat of siesta time with úrsula’s death the house again fell into a ne glect from which it could not be rescued even by a will as r esolute and vigorous as that of amar anta úrsula who many years later being a happy modern woman without prejudices with her f eet on the ground opened doors and windows in order to drive away th e rain restored the ga rden exterminated the red ants who were already walking acro ss the porch in broad da ylight and t ried in vain to reawaken the forgotten spirit of hospitality fernanda’s cloistered passion built in impenetrable dike against úrsula’s torrential hundred yea rs not only did she refuse to open d oors when the arid wind passed thro ugh but she had the wind ows nailed s hut with boards in the sh ape of a cros s obeying the paternal or der of being buried alive the expensive correspondence with the invisible doctors ended in f ailure after numerous postponements she shut herself up in her room on the date and hour agreed upon covered only by a whi te sheet and with her head p ointed north and at one o’clock in th e morning she felt that they were co vering he r head with a handkerchief soak ed in a glacial liquid when she woke up the sun was shining in the window and she had a b arbarous stitch in the sh ape of an ar c that began a t her crotch and ended a t her sternum but before she could complete th e prescribed rest she received a disturbed letter from the in visible doctors who mid th ey had inspected her for six hours without finding anything that corresponded to the symptoms so many times and so scrupulously described by her actually her pernic ious habit of not calling things by their names had brought about a new con fusion for the only thing th at the telep athic surgeons had found was a drop in the uterus which could be corrected by the use of a pessary the disillus ioned fernanda tried to obtain more precise info rmation but the unkno wn correspon dents did no t answer her letters any more she felt so defeated by the weight of an unknown word that she decided to put s hame behind her and ask what a pessa ry was and only then did she discov er that the french doctor had hang ed himself to a beam three months earli er and had b een buried a gainst the wi shes of the townspeople by a former companion in arms of colonel aureliano buendía then she confided in her son josé arcadio and the latter sen t her the pessaries from rome along with a pamphl et explaining their use which she flushed down the toilet after committing it to memory so that no one would learn th e nature of her troubles it was a useless precauti on because the only people who lived in the house scarcely p aid any atten tion to h er santa sofía de la piedad wa s wandering about in h er solitary old age cooking the little th at th ey ate and almost co mpletely d edicated to the care of josé arcadio segundo amaranta úrsula who had inherited certai n attracti ons of remedios the bea uty spent th e time that she had formerly wasted tormenting úrsula at her schoolwork and she began to show good judgment and a dedication to s tudy that br ought back to aureliano segundo the high hopes that meme had inspired i n him he had promised he r to send her to finish her studies i n brussels in accord with a custom established du ring the ti me of the banana company and that illusion had brought him to attempt to revive the lands devasta ted by the deluge the few times that he appeared at the house were for amaranta úrs ula because with time he had becom e a stranger to fernan da and little aureliano was becoming wi thdrawn as he approached puberty aureliano segundo had faith that fernanda’s heart would soften with old ag e so that the child could join in the life of the town where no one certainly would make any effort to speculate suspiciously about his origins but aureliano himself seemed to prefer the cloister o f solitude and he did not show the l east desire to know the world that began at the street door of the house when úrsula had the door of melquíades’ room opened he began to linger about it peeping through the halfopened door and no one knew at what mom ent he becam e close to jo sé arcadio segundo in a link of mutual affection aureliano segundo discovered that friendship a l ong time after it had begun when he heard the child talking about the killing at the station it happened once when someone at the table complained about the ruin into which the town ha d sunk when the banana company ha d abandoned it and aureliano contradi cted him with maturity a nd with the vision of a grown person his point of view contrar y to the general interpreta tion was that macondo had been a pr osperous place and well on its way u ntil it was disordered and corrupted and suppressed by the b anana comp any whose engineers brought on the deluge as a pretext to avoi d promises made to the workers speaking with such good sense tha t to fernanda he was like a sacrilegious parody of jews among the wise men th e child described with precise and conv incing details how the army had m achinegunned more tha n three thousa nd workers penned up by the statio n and how they loaded the bodies onto a two hundredcar train and t hrew them into the sea convinced as most people were by the official version that nothing ha d happened fernanda was scandalized with th e idea that the child had inherited the anarchist ideas of colonel aureliano buendía and told him to be quiet aureliano segundo on the other hand recognized his twin brothe r’s version actu ally in spite of the fact tha t everyone co nsidered him mad josé arcadio segundo was at that time the most lucid inhabitant of the house he taught li ttle aureliano how to r ead and write initiated him in the study of the parchments and he inculcated him wi th such a personal interpretation of what the bana na company had meant to macondo that many years later when aureliano became part of the world one would have thought that he was telling a hallucinated vers ion because it was radically opposed to the fals e one that his torians had created and consecrated in the schoolbooks in the small isolated room where the ari d air never penetrated no r the dust nor the heat both had the atavistic vision of an old man his back to the window wearing a hat with a brim like t he wings of a crow who spoke abou t the world m any years bef ore they had been born both described at the sam e time how it was always march there and always monday and then they understood that josé arcadio buendía was not as crazy as the family said but that h e was the only one who ha d enough lucidity to sens e the truth o f the fact tha t time also stumbled an d had accidents and co uld therefore splinter and leave an eternalized fragment in a room josé arcadio segu ndo had managed furtherm ore to classify the cryptic letters of the parchments he was certain that they corresponded to an alphabet of forty seven to fiftythree char acters which when sep arated looked like scratching and scribbling and which in th e fine hand of melquíades looked like pieces o f clothing put out to dry on a line aureliano remembered h aving seen a similar table in the engli sh encyclop edia so he br ought it to the room to compare it with that of josé arcadio s egundo they were indeed the same around the time of the riddle lottery aureliano segundo began waking up with a knot in his throat as if he were repressing a desire to weep petra cotes interpreted it as one more of so many upsets brought on by t he bad situation and ev ery morning for over a year she would touch his palate with a dash of honey and give him some radish syrup when the knot in his throat became s o oppressive that it was di fficult for him to breathe aureliano segundo visited pilar ternera to see i f she knew of some herb that would give him relie f the dauntl ess grandmother who had reached a hundred years of age managing a small clandestin e brothel did not trust therapeutic s uperstitions so she turned the matter over to her cards she saw the queen of diamonds with h er throat wound ed by the steel of the jack o f spades and she dedu ced that fernanda was trying to get her h usband back home by means of the discredited method of sticking pins into his picture but that she had brought on an internal tumor because of her clumsy knowledge of the black arts since aureliano segundo had no o ther pictures ex cept those o f his weddin g and the co pies were all in the family album h e kept searchi ng all through the h ouse when his wife was not lo oking and finally in the bottom of th e dresser he came across a halfdoz en pessaries in their original boxes thinking that the small red rubber rings were objects of witchcraft he put them in his pocket so that p ilar ternera could have a look at them she could not determin e their natur e but they looked so suspicious to her that in an y case she burned them in a bonfire she built in th e courtyard in order to conjure away fernanda’s alleged curse she told aureliano segundo that he should soak a broody hen and bury her alive under the ch estnut tree and he did it wi th such good fa ith that when he finis hed hiding the turnedup earth with dried leaves he already felt that he was breathing better for her part fernanda interpreted the disappear ance as a rep risal by the in visible doctors and she sewed a pocket of casing to the inside of her camisole where sh e kept the n ew pessaries that her son s ent her six months after he had buried the hen aureliano segundo woke up a t midnight with an a ttack of coughing and the feeling that he was being stra ngled within by the claws of a crab it was then that he und erstood that for all of the magical pessa ries that he destroyed an d all the con juring hens that h e soak ed the singl e and s ad piece of truth was that he was d ying he did not tell anyon e tormented by the fear of dying without having se nt amaranta úrsula to brussels he worked as he had never done and instead of one he made three weekly raffles from very early in the morning he could be seen going through the town even in th e most outlying and miserable section s trying to sell tickets with an anx iety th at could only be conceivable in a d ying man “her e’s divine providence” he hawked “don’t let it get away b ecause it o nly comes every hundred years” he made pitiful efforts to appear gay pleasant talkative but it wa s enough to see his sweat and pal eness to know that his heart was not in it sometimes he would go to vacant lots where no one could see him and sit down to rest from the claws that wer e tearing him apart inside even at midnight he would be in the redlight district tryin g to consol e with predictions of good luck the lon ely wom en who were weeping beside their phonographs “this numb er hasn’t come up in four months” he told them s howing them the tickets “don’t let it get away life is shorter than you think” they finally lost respect for him made fun of him and in his last m onths they n o longer called him don aureliano as they had always done but they called him mr divine providence right to his face his voice was becoming filled with wrong notes it was getting out of tune and it finally diminished into the growl of a dog but he still had the drive to s ee that there should be no diminishing of the hope people brought to petra cates’s courtyard as he lost his voice however and realized th at in a shor t time he wou ld be unable to bear the pain he began to understand that it was not through raffled pigs and goats that his daughter would get to brussels so he conceived the idea of organizing the fabulous raffle of the lands destroyed by the deluge which cou ld easily be restored by a person with the money to do so it was such a s pectacular u ndertaking that the mayor himself lent his aid by announcing it in a proclamation and associations were formed to buy tickets at one hu ndred pesos apiece and they were sol d out in less than a week the night of the raffle the winners held a huge celebration comparable only to thos e of the g ood days of the banana company and aureliano segundo for the last time played the forgotten songs of francisco the man on the accordion but he could no longer sing them two months later amaranta úrsula went to brussels aureliano segundo gave her not only the money from the special ra ffle but also what he had managed to put aside ov er the previous months and what little he had received from the sale of th e pianola the clavichord and other junk that had fallen into disrepair according to his calculatio ns that sum would be enough for her studies so that all that was lacking was the price of her fare back home fernanda wa s against the trip until the last moment scandalized by the idea that brussels was so close to paris and its perdition but she calmed do wn with the l etter th at father angel ga ve her addressed to a bo ardinghouse run by nuns for catholic young ladies where am aranta úrsula promised to stay until her studies were completed furthermore the parish priest arranged for her to travel under the care of a group of franciscan nuns who were going to toledo where they hoped to find dependable people to accompany her to belgium while the urgent correspondence that made the coordination possible went forward aureliano segundo aided by petra cates prepared amaranta úrsula’s baggage the night on which they were p acking one of fernanda’s bridal trunks the thi ngs were so well organized th at th e schoolgirl knew by heart which were the suits and cloth slipper s she could wear crossing the atlanti c and the blue cloth coat with copper buttons an d the cordovan shoes s he would wear when she landed she also knew how to walk so as not to fall into the water as she went up the gangplank that at no time was she to leave the company of the nuns or leave her cabin except to eat a nd that for no reason was she to answer the qu estions asked b y people of any sex while th ey were at sea she carried a small bottle with drops for seasickness a nd a notebo ok written by father an gel in his own hand containing six prayers to be used against stor ms fernanda made her a canvas bel t to keep h er money in and she would not have to take it off even to sleep she tried to give her the chamberpot washed out with lye and disinfected with alcohol bu t amaran ta úrsula refused it for fear that her schoolmates would make fun of he r a few m onths later at the hour of his deat h aureliano segundo would rememb er her as he had seen her for the la st time as s he tried uns uccessfully to lower the window of the secondclass coach to hea r fernanda’s last piece of advice she was wearing a pink silk d ress with a corsage of artificial pans ies pinned to her left shou lder her cor dovan shoes with buckles and low heels and sateen stockings held up at th e thighs with elastic garters her body was slim her hair loose and long and she had the lively eyes th at úrsula had had at her age and the way in which she said goodbye w ithout crying but without smiling e ither revealed the same strength of character wa lking beside the coa ch as it picked up speed and h olding fernanda by th e arm so that she would not stumble aureliano scarcely had tim e to wave at his daughter as she threw him a kiss with the tips of her fingers the couple stood motionless under the scorching sun looking at th e train as it merged with the black st rip of the ho rizon linking arms for the first tim e since the da y of their wedding on the ninth of august before they received the first letter from brussels josé arcadio segundo was speak ing to aureliano in melquíades’ room and without real izing it he said “always remember that they were mo re than three thousand and that they were thrown into the sea” then he fell back on th e parchmen ts and died wi th his eyes open at that same instant in fernanda’s bed his twin brother came to the en d of the prol onged and terrible martyrdom of the steel crabs that were ea ting his throat a way on e week previously he had retur ned home without any voice unable to breathe and almost skin and b ones with his wandering trunks and his wastrel’s accordion to fulfill the promise of dying beside his wife pe tra cotes hel ped him pack his clothes and bade hi m farewell without shedd ing a tear b ut she forgot to give him the paten t leather sho es that h e wanted to wear i n his coffin so when she heard that he had died she dress ed in black wrapped the shoes up in a newspaper and asked fe rnanda for permission to see the body fernanda would not let her through the door “put yourself in my place” petra cotes begged “imagine how much i must have loved him to put up with this humiliation” “there is no humiliation that a concubine does not deserve” fernanda re plied “so wait until another one of your men dies and put the shoes on him” in fulfillmen t of her pro mise santa sofía de la piedad cut the throat of jo sé arcadio segundo’s corpse with a kitchen knife to be sure that they wo uld not bury him alive the bodies were placed in identical coffins and then it could be seen that once more in death they had become as identical a s they h ad been until adolescence aureliano segundo’ s old caro using comrades laid on his casket a wreath that had a purple ribbon with the words cease cows life is short fernanda was so indignant with such irreverence tha t she had the wreath thrown onto the trash heap in the tumult of the last moment the sad drunkards who carried them out of the house got the coffins mixed up and buried them in the wrong graves chapter aurelia no did not leave melquíades’ room for a long time he lear ned by heart the fantasti c legends of the crumbling books the synthesis of the studies of hermann the cripple the notes on the science of demonology the k eys to the philosopher’s stone the centuries of nostradamus and hi s research con cerning the plague so that he reac hed adolescence without kn owing a thing about his own time bu t with the ba sic knowledge of a m edieval man an y time tha t santa sofía de la piedad would go into his room s he would fin d him absor bed in his reading at da wn she would bring him a mug of coffee without s ugar and at noon a plate of rice and slices of frie d plantain which were th e only things eaten in the h ouse since the death of aureliano segundo she saw tha t his h air was cut picked off the nits took in to his size the old cloth ing that she found in forgotten trunks and when his mustache began to appear the br ought hi m colonel aur eliano buendía’s razor and the small gourd he had used as a shaving mug none of the la tter’s children had looked so much like him not even aureliano josé particularly in respect to the prominent cheekbones and the firm and rather pitiless line of the lips as had hap pened to úrsula with aureliano segundo when the latter wa s studying in the room s anta sofía d e la piedad thought tha t aureliano was talking to himself actually he was talking to melquíades one burni ng noon a s hort time after the death of the twins against the light of the window he saw the gl oomy old ma n with his crow’swing hat like the materializati on of a memory that had been in his head since long before he was born aureliano had finished classifying the alphabet of th e parchmen ts so that when melquíades asked hi m if he had discovered the language in which they had b een wr itten he did not hesitate to answer “sanskrit ” he said melquíades revealed to him that his opportunities to return to the room were limited but he would go in peace to th e meadows of the ultima te death b ecaus e aureliano would have time to lear n sanskrit during the years remaining until the parc hments beca me one hun dred years old when they could be deciphered it was he who indicated to aureliano that on the narrow street going down to the river where dreams had been i nterpreted d uring the time of the banana com pany a wise catalonian had a bookstore where there was a sanskr it primer which would be eaten by the moths within six years if he did not hurry to buy it for the first time in her long life santa sofía de la piedad let a feeling show through and it was a feeling of wonderment when aureliano asked her to bring him t he book that could be found between jerusalem delivered and milton’s poems on the extreme righthand side of the second shelf of the bookcases since she could not read she memo rized what he had said and got some money by sellin g one of the seventeen little gold fishes left in the workshop the whereabouts of which after be ing hidden the night the soldiers searched the house was known only by her and au reliano aureliano made progress in his studies of sanskrit as melquíades’ visits became less and less frequent and he was more distant fading away in the radiant light of noon the last time th at aureliano sensed him he was only an invisible pr esence who murmured “i died of fever on th e sands of singapore” the room then became vuln erable to dus t heat termi tes red ants and moths who would turn the wisdom of the pa rchments into sawdust there was no shortage of food in the house the day after the death of aureliano segundo one of the friends who had brought the wreath with the irreverent i nscription offered to pay fernanda some money that he had owed her husband after that every wednesday a delivery boy brought a basket of food that was quite sufficient for a week no one ever knew th at those pro visions were being sent by petra cotes with the idea that th e continuing charity was a way of humiliating the person who had humiliated her neve rtheless the rancor disappeared much sooner than she hersel f had expected and then she continued sending the f ood out of pride and fina lly out of compassion several times when she h ad no animals to raffle off and people lost interest in the lottery she went without food so that fer nanda could have someth ing to eat and she continued fulfillin g the pledge to herself until she saw fernanda’s funeral procession pass by for santa sofía de la piedad the redu ction in the number of inhabitants of the house shou ld hav e meant the rest she deserved after more than half a century of work never a lament had been heard from that stealthy impenetrable wo man who ha d sown in the family the angelic seed of remedios the beau ty and the mysterious solemnity of josé arcadio segundo who dedicated a whole life of solitude and diligence to the rearing o f children alt hough she c ould barely remember whether they were her children or grandchildren and who took ca re of aureliano as if he had come out of he r womb not knowing herself that she was his great grandmother only in a house like that was it conceiv able for her always to sleep o n a mat she laid out on the pantry floor in the midst of the nocturnal noise of the ra ts and without telling anyone that one night she had awakened with the frightened feeling that someone was looking at he r in the darkness and that it was a poisonous snake crawling over her stomach she knew that if she had told úrsula the latter would have made her sleep in her own bed but those were times when no one was aware of anything unless it was shouted on the porch because wi th the bustle of the bakery th e surprises of the war th e care of the children there was not much room for thinking about other peoples happiness petra cotes who m she had never seen was the only one who remem bered he r she saw to it that she had a good pair of shoes for street wear th at she always had clothi ng even during the times when the raffles were working only through some miracle when fernanda arrived at the h ouse she had go od reason to think that sh e was an ageless servant and even th ough she heard it said several times that she was her husband’s mother it was so incredible that it took her longer to discover it than to forget it santa sofía de la piedad never seemed bothered by that lowly po sition on the contrary one had the impression that she liked to s tay in th e corners without a paus e without a complaint k eeping clea n and in order the im mens e house that she had lived in ever si nce adoles cence and that especially during the time of the b anana co mpany was mo re like a barracks than a home but when úrsula died the superhuman diligence of santa sofía de la piedad her tremendous capacity for work began to fall apart it was not only that she was old and exhausted but overnight the house had plunged into a crisis of senility a soft moss grew up the walls when there was no longer a bare spot in th e courtyard th e weeds bro ke through the cemen t of the porch breaking it like glass and out of the cracks grew the same yell ow flowers that úrsula had found in the glass with melquíades’ false teeth a century befo re with neither the tim e nor the res ources to hal t the challen ge of nature santa sofía de la piedad spent the da y in the bedrooms drivin g out the liz ards who would return at night one morning she saw that the red ants had left the undermined foundations crossed the garden climbed up the railing where the begonias had taken on an earthen color and had penetrated into the heart of the house she first tried to kill them with a broom then with insecticides and finally with lye bu t the next day they were b ack in the sa me place sti ll passing by tenacious a nd invincible fernanda writing letters to her children was not aware of th e unchecked destructive attack santa sofía de la piedad conti nued struggling alone fighting the weeds to s top them from g etting into the kitchen pulling from the walls the tassels of s pider webs wh ich were rebuilt in a few hours scraping off the termites but when she saw that melquíades’ room was also dusty and filled with cobwebs even though she swept and dusted three times a da y an d that in spite of her furious cle aning it was threaten ed by the debris and the air of misery that had b een foreseen only by colonel aureliano buendía and the young officer she realized that sh e was defeated then she put on her worn sunday dress some old shoes of úrsula’s an d a pair of cotton stocki ngs that amaranta úrsula had given her and she made a bund le out of the two or three changes of clothing that s he had left “i give up” she said to aureliano “t his is too much house for my poor bones” aureliano asked her where she was going and she made a vague sign as if she did not have th e slightest idea of her destination she tried to be more precise however saying that she was going to spend her last years with a first cousin who lived in riohacha it was not a likely explanation since the death o f her parents she had not had contact with anyone in town or received letters or messages nor had she been heard to speak of any relatives aureliano gave her fourteen little gold fishes because she was determined to leave with on ly what she had one peso and twentyfive cents from the window of the room he saw her cross the courtyard with her bundle of clothing dragging her feet and bent over b y her years a nd he s aw her reach her hand through an op ening in the mai n door and replace the b ar after she had gone out nothing was ever heard of her again when she heard about the flight fe rnanda rant ed for a whole day as s he checked trunks dressers and closets item by item to make sure th at santa sofí a de la piedad had not made off with anything she burned her fingers trying to light a fi re for the first time in her life and she had to ask aureliano to do her the favor of showing her how to make coffee fernanda would find her breakfast ready when sh e arose and she would le ave her room again only to get the meal tha t aureliano had left covered on the embers for her wh ich she would carry to the table to eat on linen tablecloths a nd between candelabra sitting at the solitary head of the table facing fifteen empty chairs even under those circumstances aureliano and fernanda did not share their solitude but both continu ed living on their own cl eaning their respective ro oms while th e cobwebs fell like snow on the rose bushes carp eted the bea ms cushioned th e walls i t was around that time th at fer nanda got the impr ession that the house was filling up with elves it was as if things especially those for everyday use had develo ped a faculty for changi ng location on their own fernanda would waste time looking for the shea rs that sh e was sure sh e had put on the bed and after turning everything upside down she would find them on a shelf in the kitchen wh ere she thou ght she had not been for four days suddenly there was no fork in the silv er chest and she would find six on the altar and three in the washroom that wander ing about of things was even more exasperating when she sa t down to write the inkwell that she h ad placed at her right would be on the left the blotter would be lost and she would find it two days later unde r her pillow and the pages written to j osé arcadi o would get mixed up with those wr itten to am aranta úrsula and she a lways had the feeling of mortification that she had put the letters in opposi te envelopes as in fact happened s everal times on one occa sion she lost her fountain pen two weeks later the mailman who had found it in his bag returne d it he had been going from house to house looking for its owne r at first she thought it was some business of t he invisible doctors lik e the disappearance of the pessaries and she even started a l etter to them b egging them to leave h er alone but sh e had to interrupt it to d o something and when she went back to her room she not only di d not find the letter she had started but she had forgotten th e reason for writing it for a time sh e thought i t was aurelian o she bega n to sp y on him to put things in his path trying to catch hi m when he cha nged their location but s he was soon convinced that aureliano never left melquíades’ room except to go to the kitchen or th e toilet and that he was not a man to play tricks so in the en d she believed that it was the mischief of elves and she decided to secure everything in th e place wher e she would use it she tied the shears to th e head of her bed with a long string she tied the pen and the blotter to the leg of the table an d the glued the inkwell to the top of it to the right of the pla ce where sh e normally wrote the pro blems were not solved o vernight because a few h ours after she ha d tied the string to th e shears it was not long enough for her to cut with as if the elves had s hortened it the same thing happened to her with the string to the pen and even with her own arm which after a short time of writing could not reach the inkwell neither amaranta úrsula in brussels nor josé arcadio in rome ever heard about those insignificant misfortunes fernanda told them th at she was h appy and in reality she was precisely because she felt free from any comp romise as if life were pull ing her once more to ward the world of her parents where one did not suffer with daytoday problems beca use they were solved beforehand in one’s imagination that endless correspondence mad e her lose her sense of time especially after santa sofía de la piedad had left she had been accustom ed to keep track of the days months and years using as points of reference the da tes set for the return of her children but when they changed their plans time and time again the dates beca me confused the periods were mislaid and one day seemed so much like another that o ne could not feel them p ass instead of becoming impatient s he felt a deep pleasure in the dela y it did not worry her that many years after announcing the eve of hi s final vows josé arcadi o wa s still saying that he was waiting to finish his studies in advanced theol ogy in order to undertak e those in diplomacy because she understood how steep and p aved with obs tacles was th e spiral stairw ay th at led to the thron e of saint peter on the other hand her spirits rose with news that would have been insignificant for other people such a s the fact that her son had seen the pope she felt a similar pleasure when amaranta úrsula wrote to tell her that her studies would last longer than the time foreseen because her excellen t grades had earned her p rivileges that her father had not taken into account in his calculations more than three years had passed since santa so fía de la pie dad had brought him the grammar when aureli ano succeed ed in translating the first sh eet it was not a us eless chore but it was only a first step along a road whose length it was impossi ble to predict because th e text in spa nish did not mean anythi ng the lines were in code aureliano lack ed the m eans to estab lish the keys that would permit him to dig them out but since melquíades had told him that the bo oks he needed to get to the bottom of the parch ments were i n the wise c atalonian’s store he decided to sp eak to fernan da so that she would let him get them in the room devoured by rubble whose unchecked proliferation had finally defeated it h e thought a bout the b est way to frame the requ est but when he foun d fernanda taking her meal from the embers which was his only chance to speak to her the laboriously formulated request stuck i n his throat and he lost his voice that was the o nly time th at he watched her he listened to her steps in the bedroom he heard her on her way to the door to await th e letters from her children and to give hers to the mailman and he listened until late at night to the harsh impassioned scratching of her pen on the paper before hearing the sound of the light switch and the murmur of her prayer s in the d arkness only then did he go to sleep trusting that o n the following day the awaited opportunity would come he became so inspired with the idea that permission would be gra nted th at on e morning he cut his hair which a t that tim e reach ed down to his shoulders shaved off his tangled beard put on some tig htfitting pants and a shirt with an artificial collar that he h ad inherited from he did not know whom and waited in th e kitchen for fernanda to get her break fast the wo man of ever y day th e one with h er head held hig h and with a stony gait did not arrive but an old woman of s upernatural beauty with a yellowed ermine cape a crown of gilded cardboar d and the languid look of a person who wept in s ecret actually ever since she had found it in aureliano segundo’s trunks fe rnanda had put on th e motheaten queen’s dress many times anyone who could have seen her in fr ont of the mirror in ecstasy over her own regal gestures would have had reason to think that she was mad but she was no t she had simply turned the royal regalia into a device for her memory th e first time that she put i t on sh e coul d not h elp a knot from forming in her heart and her eyes filling with tears because at that moment she smelled once more the odor of shoe polish on the boots of the office r who came to get her at her house to make her a q ueen and her soul brightened with th e nos talgia of her lost dreams she felt so old so worn out so far away from the best moments of her life that she even yearned for those that she remembered as the worst and only then did she discover how much she missed the whiff of oregano on the porch and the smell of the roses at d usk and even the bestial nature of the parvenus her heart of compressed ash which had resisted the most telling blow s of daily re ality without strain fell apart with the first waves of nostalgia the need to feel sad was becoming a vice as th e years eroded her she became hu man in her solitude nevertheless the morning on which she entered the kitchen and found a cup of coffee o ffered her by a pale and bony adolescent with a hallucinated glow in his eyes th e claws of ridicu le tore at her not o nly did she refuse him permission but from th en on she ca rried the keys to th e hou se in the po cket wh ere s he kept the unused pessaries it was a useless precaution beca use if he h ad wan ted to aureliano could ha ve escaped and even returned to the house withou t being seen but the prolonged captivity th e uncertainty of the world the habi t of obedience had dried up the seeds of rebellion in his heart so that he wen t back to his enclosure reading and re reading the par chments and listening until very late at night to f ernanda sobbing in her bedroom one morning he went to lig ht the fire as usual and on the extinguished ashes he found the food that he had left for her the day before then he looked into her bed room and saw her lying on the bed cove red with the ermine cape more b eautiful than ever and with her skin turned into an ivory casing four months later when josé arcadio arrived he found her intact it was impo ssible to con ceive of a m an more like his mother he was wearing a somber taffeta suit a shirt with a round and hard collar and a thin silk ribbon tied in a bow in place of a necktie he was ruddy and languid with a startled look and weak lips his black hair shiny and smooth parted in the middle of hi s head by a straight and tired line had the sam e artificial appeara nce as the hair on the saints the shadow of a welluprooted beard on his paraffin face looked like a question of conscience his hands were pale with green veins and fingers that were like parasites and he wore a solid gold ring w ith a round sunflower opal on his le ft index finger when he opened the street door aureliano did not have to be told who he was to realize th at he came fr om far away with his steps the house filled up with the fragran ce of the toilet water that úrsula used to splash on him when h e was a child in order to find him in the shadows in some way impossible to ascertain after so many years of absence josé arcadio was still an autumnal child terribly sad and solitary he went directl y to his moth er’s bedroom where au reliano had boiled mercury for four months in his grandfather’s grandfather’s water pipe to conserve the bod y according to melquíades’ formula josé arcadio did not ask him any question s he kissed the corpse on the forehead and withdrew from under her skirt the pocket of casing which containe d three as yet unused pessaries and the key to h er cabinet he did everythin g with di rect and decisive movements in c ontrast to his languid look from the cabinet he took a s mall damascene ches t with the family crest and found on the inside which was perfumed with sandalwood the long letter in which fernanda unburdened her heart of th e numerous truths that she had hidden from him he read it stan ding up avidly but with out anxiety and at the thi rd page he stopped and examined aureliano with a look of second recognition “so” he said with a voice with a touch of razor in it “you’re the bastard” “i’m aureliano buendía” “go to your room” josé arcadio said aureliano went and did not come ou t again even fr om curiosity when he h eard the sou nd of the solitary funeral ceremonies sometimes from th e kitchen he would see josé arcadio strollin g through the house smothered by his anxious breath ing and he continued hearing his steps in the ruined bedrooms after midnight he did not hear his voice for many months not only because jos é arcadio never addressed him but also because he had no desire for it to happen or time to think about anythi ng else but the parchmen ts on fernanda ’s death he had taken out the nexttothelast little fish and gone to the wise catalonian’s bookst ore in search of the books he needed nothing he saw along th e way interes ted him p erhaps because he la cked a ny mem ories for comparison and t he deserted streets and deso late houses were the sa me as he ha d imagined them at a ti me when he would have given his soul to know them he had given himself the permis sion denied by fernanda and only once and for the minimum time necess ary so without pausing he went alo ng the eleven blocks that s eparated the house from the narrow st reet where d reams had b een interpreted in other days and he went panti ng into the confused and gloomy place where there was ba rely room to move more than a bookstore it looked like a dum p for used books which were placed in disorder on the sh elves chewed b y termites in the corners st icky with cobwebs and even in the spaces th at were suppos ed to serve as passageways on a long ta ble also heaped with ol d books and papers the proprietor was writing tireless prose in purple lett ers somewh at outlandish and on the loose pages of a school notebook he had a hands ome head of silver hair which fell down over his forehead like the plume o f a cockatoo and his blue eyes lively and closeset revealed the gentleness of a ma n who had read all of the books he was wearing short pants and soaking in perspiration and he di d not stop his writing to se e who had come in aure liano had no difficulty in rescuing the five books that he was looking for from that fabulous diso rder because they were ex actly where melquíades had told him they would be without saying a wor d he handed them along with the little gold fish to the wise catalonian a nd the latter examined th em his eyelids contracting like two clams “you must be mad” he said in his own language sh rugging his shoulders and he handed back to aureliano the five books and the little fish “you can h ave them” h e said in span ish “the last man who read th ese b ooks must ha ve been isaac the bli ndman so consider well what you’re doing” josé arcadio restored meme’s bedroom and had the velvet cu rtains cleaned and m ended along with the damask on the canopy of the viceregal be d and he put to use once more the abandoned bathroom where the cement pool was blackened by a fibrous and rough coating he restricted his vestpocket empire of worn exotic clothing fals e perfumes and cheap jewelry to tho se places th e only thing that seemed to worry hi m in the res t of the hou se were the saints on th e family alta r which he bu rned down to ashes one afternoon in a bonfire he lighted in the courtyard he would sleep until p ast eleven o’clock he would go to th e bathroom in a shabby r obe with go lden dragon s on it and a pair of slippers with yellow tassels and there he wou ld officiate at a rite which for its care and length r ecalled remedios the b eauty before bathing he would perfume the pool with the salts that h e carried in three ala baster flacon s he di d not bath e hims elf with the gourd but would plunge into the fragrant waters a nd remain there for two hours floating on his bac k lulled by t he coolnes s and by the memory of amaranta a few days after arriving he put aside his taffeta s uit which in addition to b eing too hot for the town was th e onl y one that h e had and h e exchanged it for som e tightfitting pants very similar to those worn by pietro crespi during his dance lessons and a silk shirt woven with thread from livin g caterpillars and with his initials embroidered over the heart twice a week he would wash the co mplete ch ange in the tub and would wear his robe until it dried because he had nothing else to put on he never ate at home he would go out when the hea t of siesta time had eased an d would not return until well into the night then he would continue his anxious pacing breathing like a cat and thinking a bout amara nta she and the frightful look of the saints in the glow of the nocturnal lamp were the two memor ies he retained of the house many times during the hallucinating roman august he had opened his eyes in the middle of his sleep and had seen amaranta rising out of a marbleedged pool with her lace petticoats and the bandage on her hand idealized by th e anxiety of exile unlike aureliano josé who tried to drown that image i n the bloody b og of war he tried to keep it alive in the sink of concupiscence while he entertained his mother with the endless fable of his pontifical vo cation it never occurred either to him or to fernanda to think that their correspondence was an exchange of fantasies josé arcadio who left the seminary as soon as he reached rome conti nued nourishing the legend of theology and canon law so as not to jeopardize the fabulous inheritan ce of which his mother’s delirious letters spoke and which would rescue him from the misery and sordid ness he shared with two friends in a trastevere garret when he received fernanda’s last letter dict ated by the f oreboding of imminent d eath he pu t the leftovers of his false splendor into a suitcase and crossed the ocean in the hold of a ship wh ere immigrants were cramm ed together l ike cattle in a slaughterhouse eating cold macaro ni and worm y cheese b efore he read fernanda’s wil l which wa s nothing but a detailed an d tardy recap itulation of her misfortunes the brokendown furniture and th e weeds on the porch h ad indicated that h e had fallen into a trap from which he would never es cape exiled forever from the diam ond light and timeless air o f the roman spring during the crushing insomnia brought on by his asthm a he would measure and remeasure the depth of his misfortune as he went through the shadowy house where the senile fussing of úrs ula had instilled a fear o f the world in him in order to be sure that she would not l ose him in the shadows she had assi gned him a corner of th e bedroom the only on e where he wo uld be safe from the dea d people who wandered through the house after sundown “if you do anything bad” úrsula would tell him “th e saints will let me know” the terrorfilled nights of his childhood were reduced to tha t corner where he would remain moti onless until it was time to go to bed perspiring with fear on a stool under the watchful and glacial eyes of the ta ttletale sain ts it was useless torture because even at that time he already had a terror of everything around him and he was prepared to be frightened at a nything he met in life women on the street wh o would ruin his blood the women in the house who bore children with th e tail of a pig fighting cocks who brought on t he death of men and remorse for the rest of one ’s life firearms which with the mere touch would bring down twenty years of war uncer tain ventu res which led only to disillusionment and madness —everything in short everything th at god h ad created in h is infinite goodness an d that the devi l had perverted when he awakened pre ssed in the vise of his nightmares the light in the window and the caresses of amaranta in the bath and the pleasure of being powdered between the legs with a silk puff would release him from the terror even úrsula was different under the radiant light in the garden because th ere she did not talk about fearful things but would brush his teeth with charcoal powder so that he would ha ve the radia nt smile of a pope and she would cu t and polish his nails so that the pilgrims who ca me to rom e from all over the world would be startled at the beauty of the pope’s hands as he blessed them a nd she woul d comb his hair like that of a pope a nd she would sprinkle his body and his clothing with toilet water so that his body and his clothes would have the fragrance of a pope in the courtyard of castel gandolfo he had seen the pope on a b alcony maki ng the same speech in seve n languages for a crowd of pilgrims and the onl y thing indeed that had drawn his attention was the whitenes s of his hands which seemed to have been soaked in lye the da zzling shine of his su mmer clothing and the hidden breath of cologne almost a year after his return home having sold the silver candlesticks and the heraldic chamberpot—which at the moment of truth turned out to have only a little gold plating on the crest—in order to eat the only distr action of jos é arcadio was to pick u p children in town so that they could play in the house he would appear with th em at siesta time and have them s kip rope in the garden sing on the porch and do acrobatics o n the furniture in the living room while he would go among the groups giving lessons in good manner s at that time he h ad finished with the tight pants and th e silk shirts and was weari ng an ordinary suit of clothing that he had bought in the arab stores but he still maintained his languid dignity a nd his papal air the children took over the house just as meme’s schoolmates had done in the past until well into the ni ght they cou ld be hear d chattering an d singing and tapdancing so that the house resembled a boarding school where there was no discipline aureliano did not worry about th e invasion as long as they did not bother him in melquíades’ room one morning two children pushed open the door and were startled at the sight of a filthy and hairy man who was still deciphering the parchments on the worktable they did not dare go in but they kept on watching the room t hey would p eep in throu gh the cracks whispering they threw live animals in through the transom an d on one occasion they nailed up the door and the window and it took aureliano half a day to force them open amused at their unpunishe d mischief four of the children went into the room one morning while aureliano was in the kitchen preparing to destroy th e parchmen ts but as so on as they laid hands on the yellowed sheets an a ngelic force lifted them off the ground and held them suspended in the ai r until aureliano returned and took the parchments away from them from then on they did not bother him the four oldest children who wore short pants in spite of the fact that they were on the threshold of adolescen ce busied themselves with josé arcadi o’s personal appearance they woul d arrive earlier than the o thers and spend the mor ning shaving him giving him massages with hot towels cutti ng and polishing the nails on his hand s and feet and perfuming him with toilet water on several occasions they would get into the pool to soap him from head to toe as he floated on hi s back thinking about amaranta then they would dr y him pow der his body and dress him one of the children who had curly blond hair and eyes of pink glass like a rabbit was accustomed to sleeping in the house the bonds that linked him to josé arcadio were so strong that he would accompany him in his asthmatic in somnia without speaking strolling throu gh the house with him in the darkness one night i n the room where úrsula had slep t they sa w a yellow glow co ming through the crumbling cement as if an underground sun had changed the floor of the room into a pane of glass they did not have to turn on th e light it was sufficient to lift the broken slabs in the corner where úrsula’s bed had always stood and wh ere the glow was most intens e to find th e secret crypt that aureliano segundo had worn himself out sear ching for during the delirium of his excavations there were the three canvas sacks closed with copper wire and inside of them the seven thousand two hundred fourteen pieces of eight which contin ued glowing like embers in the darkness the discovery of the treasure was like a deflagra tion instea d of returning to rome with the sudden fortune which had been his dream maturing in misery josé arcadio converted the house into a decadent paradise he replaced the curtains and the cano py of the b ed with new velvet and he had the bathroom floor covered wi th paving stones and the walls with tiles the cupboard in the dining room was filled w ith fruit pres erves ha ms and pickles and the unused pantry was opened again for the storage of wines and liqueurs which josé arcadio himself brought from the railroad station in crates marked with his name one night he and th e four oldest children had a party tha t lasted until d awn at six i n the morni ng they came out naked from the bedroom drained the pool and filled it with champagne they ju mped in en masse swimming like birds flying through a sky gilded with fragrant bubbles while josé arcadio floated on hi s back on th e edge of the festivities rememberin g amaranta with his eyes open he remain ed tha t way wrapp ed up in hims elf thinking about the bitterness of his equivocal pleasures until after the chi ldren had become tired a nd gone in a troop to the bedroom where they tore down the cu rtains to dry themselves and in the disorder they broke the rock crystal mirror into four pieces and destroyed the canop y of the bed in the tumult of lying down when josé arcadio came back fr om the bathroom he found them sleeping in a naked heap in the ship wrecked bedro om inflamed not so much because o f the dam age as becaus e of the disgust and pity th at he felt for himself in the emptines s of the saturnalia he armed himself with an eccl esiastical cat oninetails that he kept in the botto m of his trunk along with a hairshirt and other i nstruments of mortification and penance and d rove the chi ldren out of the house howling like a madm an and whipping them witho ut mercy as a person woul d not ev en have done to a pack of coyotes he was done in with an atta ck of asthma that lasted for several days and tha t gave him t he look of a man on his deathbed on the third night of to rture overcome by asphyxiation he went to aureliano’s room to ask him the favor of buying some powder s to inhale at a nearby dru gstore so it was that aureliano wen t out for a second time he had to go only two blocks to reach th e smal l pharmacy with dusty wi ndows an d ceramic b ottles with labels in lati n where a girl with the stea lthy beauty of a serpen t of the nile gave him the medicine the name of which josé arcadio had written down on a piece of paper the second vi ew of the d eserted town barely illuminated by the yellowish bulbs of the st reet lights did not awaken in aureliano any more curiosity than the first josé arcadio had come to think that he had run a way when he reappeared panting a littl e becaus e of his haste dra gging legs that enclosure and lack of mobility had made weak and heavy his indifference toward the world was so certain that a few days later josé arcadio violated the promise he had made to h is mother an d left him free to go out whenever he wanted to “i have nothing to do outside” aureliano answered him he remained shut up ab sorbed in th e parchm ents which he was slow ly unraveling an d whose meaning nevertheless he was unable to interpret josé arcadio would bring slices of ham to him in his room sugared flowers which le ft a springlike aftertaste in hi s mouth and on two occasions a glass of fine wine he wa s not interested in the par chments wh ich he thought of more as an esoteri c pastime but his attentio n was attra cted by the ra re wisdom a nd the inexplicable knowledge of th e world that h is desolate kinsman had he discovered then th at he could un derstand written english and that b etween parch ments he h ad gone from the first page to th e last of the six volumes of the encyclopedia as if it were a novel at first he attributed to tha t the fact th at aureliano could speak about rome as if he had lived there many years bu t he soon became aware that he knew things that were not in the encyclopedia such as the price of items “everything is known” was the only reply he received from aureliano when he asked him wher e he had got that information from aureliano for his part was surprised that josé arcadio wh en seen from close by was so different from the image that h e had formed of him wh en he sa w him wandering through the house he was capable of laughing of allowing himself from time to time a feeling of nostalgia for the past of th e house and of showing concern for the sta te of misery present in melquíades’ room that dra wing closer together of two solitary people of the same blood was far from friendship but it did allow them both to bear up better u nder the unfathomable s olitude that separated an d united them at the sa me time josé arcadio cou ld then turn to aurelia no to unta ngle certain domestic p roblems tha t exasperated him aureliano in turn could sit an d read on th e porch wai ting for the letters fro m amaranta úrsula which still arrived with the usual punctuality and could use the bathroom from which josé arcadio had banished him when he arrived one hot da wn they both woke up in a larm at an ur gent knocking on the street door it was a dark old man with large green eyes th at gave his face a ghostly phosphorescence and with a cross of ashes on his forehead his clothing in tatter s his shoes cracked the o ld knapsack on his shoulder his only luggage he looked like a beggar but his bearing ha d a dignity that was in frank contradi ction to his appearance it was only neces sary to look at him on ce even i n the shado ws of the pa rlor to realize that th e secr et strength that allowed him to live was not the instinct of selfpreservation but th e habit of fear it was aureliano amado r the only survivor of colonel aureliano buendía’s seventeen sons searching for a respite in his lon g and hazard ous existence as a fugitive he identif ied himself begged them to give him refuge in that house which during his nights as a pariah he had remembered as the las t redoubt of safety left for hi m in life but josé arcadi o and aureli ano did not remember hi m thinking that h e was a tramp th ey pushed him i nto the street they both saw fro m the doorway the end of a drama that had began b efore josé arcadio had reached the age of reason two policemen who had been chasing aureliano amador for years who had tracked him like bloodhounds across hal f the world came out from among the almond trees on the opposite sidewalk and took two sh ots with thei r mausers which neatly p enetrated the cross of ashes ever since he had expelled the children from the house josé arcadio was really waiting for news of an ocean l iner that would leave for naples be fore christmas he had told aureliano and had even made plans to set him up in a business that woul d bring him a living because the bask ets of food had stopped coming since fernanda’s burial but th at last dream would not be fulfilled either one september morning after having coffee in the k itchen with aureliano josé arcadio was finishing his daily bath when thro ugh the openings in the tiles the fo ur children he had expel led from the house burst in without giving him time to defend himself they jumped into the pool fully clothed grabbed him by the hair and held hi s head under the water until the bu bbling of his death throes ceased on the surface and his silent and pale dolphin body dipped down to the b ottom of the fragrant water then they took out the three sack s of gold from the hiding place which was know n only to them and their victim it wa s such a rapid methodica l and brutal action that it was like a military operation aureliano shut up in his room was not aware of anythin g that afternoon hav ing missed him in the kitchen he look ed for josé arcadio all over the hous e and found him floating on the perfumed mirror of the pool enormous and bl oated and still thinking about amaranta only then did he understand how much he had began to love him chapter amaranta úrsula returned with th e angels of decemb er driven on a sailor’s breeze leading her husband by a silk rope t ied around his neck she appeared without war ning wearin g an ivory colored dress a string o f pearls that reached almo st to her knees emerald and topaz rings and with her straight hair in a smooth bun held behind he r ears by swall owtail brooches the man whom she had married six months before was a thin older fl eming with the look of a sailor about him she had only to push open the door to t he parlor to re alize th at her absence h ad been longer and m ore destructive than she had i magined “good lord” she shouted more gay than alarmed “it’s obvious that th ere’s no woma n in this house” the baggage would not f it on the por ch besides fe rnanda’s old trunk which they had sent her off to school with she had two upright trunks four large suitcases a bag for her parasols eight hatboxes a gigantic cage with half a hundred ca naries and her husband’s velocipede broken down in a special case which allowed him to carry it like a cello she did not even take a day o f rest after the long trip she put on some worn denim overalls that her husband had brought along with other automotive i tems and set about on a new restorati on of the ho use she scattered the red ants who had already taken possess ion of the po rch brought th e rose bus hes back to l ife uprooted the weeds and planted ferns orega no and begonias again in the pots along the railing she took charge of a crew of carpenters locksmiths and masons who f illed in the cracks in the floor put doors and windows back on their hi nges repaired the furnitu re and whitewashed the walls inside and out so that three m onths after her arrival one breathed once more the atmosph ere of youth and festivity that had existed during the days of the pianola no one in the house had ever been in a better mood at all hours and under any circumstances nor ha d anyone ever been readier to sing and dance and toss all item s and custo ms from the past into th e trash with a sweep o f her broom she did awa y with the funeral mementos and piles of useless tra sh and articles of superst ition that had been piling up in the corners and the only thing she spared ou t of gratitude to úrsula was the daguerreotype of remedios in the parlor “my such luxury” she wo uld shout dying with laughter “a fourteenyear old grandmother” when one of the masons told her that th e house was full of apparitions and that the only way to drive them out was to look for th e treasures they had l eft buried she replied amid loud laughter that she did not think it was right fo r men to be s uperstitious she was so s pontaneous so emancip ated with su ch a free and modern spirit that aureli ano did not know what to do with his body when he saw her a rrive “my my” she sh outed happil y with open arms “look at how my darling cannibal has grown” before he had a chan ce to react s he had alrea dy put a record on th e portable pho nograph she had brought with her a nd was tryin g to teach hi m the latest dance steps she made hi m change th e dirty pan ts that h e had inherited from colonel aureliano b uendía and gave him some youthful shirts and twotoned shoe s and she would push him into the street when he was spen ding too much time in melquíades’ room active small and indomitable like úrsula and al most as pretty and provocative as remedios the beauty she was endowed with a rare instinct for an ticipating fashion when she received pictures of the most recent fashions in the mail they only proved that she had not been wrong about the models that she designed herself and sewed on am aranta’s primitive pedal machine she subscribed to every fashion magazine art publication and popular music review published in europe and she had only to glance at them to realize that things in the world were going just as she imagined they were it was incomprehensible why a woman with th at spirit would have returned to a dead town burdened by dust and hea t and much l ess with a husband who h ad more tha n enough m oney to liv e anywhere in the world and who loved her so much that he let h imself be led around by her on a silk leash as tim e passed ho wever her intention to stay was mor e obvious because sh e did not make any plans th at were no t a long way off nor did she do anything that did not have as an aim the search for a comfortable life and a peaceful old age in macond o the canar y cage showed that th ose aims were m ade up on the spur of the mom ent rememb ering that h er mother had told her in a letter about the extermina tion of the birds she had delayed her trip several months until she found a ship that sto pped at the fortunate isles and th ere she chose th e finest twen tyfive pairs of canaries so that she could repopulate the skies of macondo that was the most lamentable of her numerous frustrated undertakings as the birds reproduced am aranta úrsula would release th em in pairs and no sooner di d they feel themselves free than they fled the town she tried i n vain to awaken love in them b y means of the bi rd cage th at úrsula had bu ilt during the first reco nstruction of the house also in vain were the ar tificial nests built of es parto grass in the almond trees and th e birdseed strewn about the roofs and arousing the captives so that their songs would dissuade the deserters because they would take flights on their first attemp ts and make a turn in the sky just the time needed to fi nd the direction to the fortunate isles a year after her return although she had not su cceeded in making any friends or giving any parties amaranta úrsula still belie ved that it was possible to resc ue the community which had been singled out by misfortune gaston her husband took care not to antagonize her although since th at fatal noon when he got o ff the train he realized th at his wife’s determinatio n had been provoked by a nostalgic mirage certain that she would be defea ted by the realities he did not even take the trouble to p ut his velocipede togeth er but he s et about hu nting for the largest eggs among the spider webs that th e mas ons had knocked down and he woul d open them with his fingernails and spend hours looking through a magnifying glass at the tiny spi ders that em erged later on thinking that am aranta úrsula was continuing with her re pairs so that her hand s would not be idle he decided to assemble the handsome bicycle on which the front wheel was much larger than the rear one and he dedicated hi mself to the capture and curi ng of every native insect he coul d find in the region which he sent in j am jars to hi s former pr ofessor of natural history a t the university of liège where he h ad done adva nced work in entomology although his main vocation was th at of aviator when he rode the bicycl e he would wear acrobat’s tights gaudy socks and a sherlock holmes cap but when he was on foot he would dr ess in a spotless natural linen suit white shoes a sil k bow tie a straw boater and he would carry a willow stick in his hand his pale eyes accentua ted h is look of a sailor and hi s small mustache looked like the fur o f a squirrel although he wa s at least fifteen years older than h is wife his alert determi nation to m ake her hap py and his qualities as a good lover compensated for the difference actua lly those who saw that man in his forties with careful habits with the leas h around his neck and his circus bicy cle would n ot have thou ght that h e had made a pact of unbr idled love with his wife a nd that they both gave i n to the reci procal drive in the least adequate of places and wherever the spirit moved them as th ey had don e since they h ad began to keep compa ny and with a passion that the pa ssage of time and the more and more unusual circumstances deepened a nd enriched gaston was not only a fierce lover with endless wisdom and imagination but he was also perhaps the first ma n in the history of the species who had made an emergency landing and had come close to killing hims elf and hi s sweetheart simply to make love in a field of violets they had m et two years before they were married when th e sports biplane in which he wa s making rolls over the school where amaranta ú rsula was studying made an intrepid maneuver to avoid the flagpole and the primitive framework of canvas and aluminum foil was caught by the tail on some electric wires from then on paying no atten tion to his leg in splints on week ends he would pick up amaranta úrsula at the nun’s boa rdinghouse where she lived where the rules wer e not as severe as fernanda had wanted and he would take her to his country club they began to love each other at an alti tude of fifteen hundred f eet in the sunday air of the moors and they felt all the closer together as the beings o n earth gr ew more and more minu te she spok e to him of macondo as the brightest and most peaceful to wn on earth and of an enormous house scented with oregan o where she wanted to live until old age with a loyal husband and two s trong sons who would be named rodrigo and gonzalo never aureliano and josé arcadio and a daughter who would be named virginia and never r emedios she ha d evoked the to wn idealized by nos talgia with such strong tenacity that gaston und erstood that she would n ot get married unless he took her to live in macondo he agreed to it as he agreed later on to the leash beca use he th ought it was a passing fancy that could be overcome in time but when two years in macondo had passed an d amaranta ú rsula was as happy as on the first day he began to show signs of al arm by that time he had dissected every dissectible insect in the region he spoke spanish like a native and he had solved all of the crossword puzzles in the magazines that he received in the mail he did not have the pretext of climate to hasten their retur n because n ature had end owed him wi th a colonial liver which resisted the drowsiness of siesta time and wa ter that had vin egar worms in it he liked the na tive cooking so much that o nce he a te eightytwo igua na eggs at one sitting amaranta ú rsula on the other hand had brought in by train fish and she llfish in boxes of ice canned meats an d preserved fruits which were the only things she could eat an d she still dressed in european style and received designs by mail in spite of the fact that she had no place to go and no one to visit an d by that tim e her husband was not in a mood to appreciate her s hort skirts her tilted felt ha t and her sevenstrand necklaces h er secret seemed to lie in the fa ct tha t she always found a wa y to keep bus y resolving domestic pr oblems tha t she herself h ad created and doing a poor job on a thousand things which she would fix on the following day with a pernicious diligence that made one think of fernanda and the hereditar y vice of making something just to un make it her festive genius was still so alive then that when sh e received n ew records she would invite gaston to stay in th e parlor until very late to practice th e dance steps that her scho olmates desc ribed to her in sketches a nd they wou ld generally end up making love on the viennes e rocking chairs or on the bare floor the only thi ng that she needed to be completely happy was the birth of her children but she respected the p act she had made with h er husband not to have an y until they h ad been marr ied for five years looking for something to fill his idle hours wi th gaston became accustomed to spending the morning in melquíades’ room with the shy aureliano he took pleasure in recalling with him th e most hidden corners of his country which aureli ano knew as if he had s pent much time there when gasto n asked him what he ha d done to obtain knowledge that was not in the encyclopedia he received the same ans wer as josé arcadio “eve rything is known” in addition to s anskrit he ha d learned english and french and a littl e latin and greek since he went ou t every afternoon at that time and amaranta úrsula had set a side a weekl y sum for him for his personal expenses his room looked like a branch of the wise catalonian’s bookstor e he read avidly until late at ni ght although from the manner in which he referred to his read ing gaston thought that he did not buy the books in order to learn but to verify the truth of hi s knowledge a nd that non e of them in terested him more than the parchmen ts to which h e dedica ted mo st of his time in the morning both gaston and his wife wou ld have liked to incorpor ate him into the family lif e but aureliano was a hermetic man with a cloud of mystery that time was making denser it was such an unfathomable condition that gaston failed in his efforts to becom e intimate with him and had to s eek other pastimes for his idle hours it was around that time that he conceive d the idea of esta blishing an airmail service it was not a new project actually he had it fair ly well advanced when he met amaran ta úrsula except that it was not for macondo but for the be lgian congo where his family had investments i n palm oil the marriage a nd the decision to spend a few months in macond o to please his wife had obliged him to postpon e it but wh en he sa w that amaran ta úrsula was deter mined to organize a commission for public improvement and even laughed at him when he hinted a t the possibility o f returning he understood that things were going to take a long time and he reestablished contact with his forgotten partn ers in brussels thinking that it was just as well to be a pioneer in the caribbean as in africa while his steps were pr ogressing he prepared a landing field in the o ld enchanted region which at th at time looked like a plain of cr ushed flintstone and he studied the wind directio n the geogra phy of the coastal region and the bes t routes for a erial navigation with out knowing that his diligence so similar to that of mr herbert was filling the town with th e dangerous suspicion that his plan wa s not to set up routes bu t to plant banana trees enthusiastic over the idea that after all might justify his permanent establis hment in macondo he took several trips to the capital of the province met with authorities obtained licenses an d drew up contracts for exclusive rights in the meantime he maintai ned a corre spondence with his par tners in br ussels which resembled that of fernanda with the invisible doctors and he finally convinced them to ship the first airplane under the care of an ex pert mech anic who woul d assemble i t in the near est port and fly it to macondo one year after his first meditati ons and meteorological calculations trusting in the repeated promises of his correspondents he had acquired the habit of strolling through the streets looking at the sky hanging onto the so und of the breeze in hop es that th e airplane would appear although she had not no ticed it th e return of amaranta úrsula had brought on a radical chang e in aureliano’s life after the death of josé arcadi o he had become a regular customer at the wise catalonian’s bookstore also the freed om that he en joyed then and the time at his dispos al awoke in him a certai n curiosity about the to wn which he came to k now without any surprise he went through the dusty and so litary streets examining with scientifi c interest the inside of houses in ruin the metal screens on the windows broken by rust and the d ying birds and the inhabitants bowed down by memories he tried to reconstruct in hi s imagination the annihilated splendor of the old bananacompany town whose dry swimming pool wa s filled to the brim with rotting men’s and women’s shoes and in the houses of which destroyed by r ye gras s he found the s keleton of a german shepherd dog st ill tied to a ring by a steel chain and a telephone that was ringing ringin g ringin g until he picked it up and an anguished an d distant woman spoke in english and he said yes that the stri ke was over that three thousand dea d people had been thrown into the sea that the banana company had left and that macondo finally had peace after many years those wanderings led him to the prostrate redlight district wher e in other ti mes bundles of banknotes had been burned to li ven up th e revels and which at tha t time was a maze of str eets more af flicted and miserable than the other s with a few red lights st ill burnin g and with deserted dance halls adorned with the rem nants of wreaths where the pale fa t widows of no one the french greatgrandmothers and the babylonian matriarchs were still waiting be side their photographs aureliano could not fin d anyone who remembered his family not even co lonel aureliano buendía except for the oldest of the west indian negroes an old man whose cottony hair gave him the look of a photographic nega tive and who was still sin ging the mo urnful s unset psalms in th e door of h is house aureliano would talk to him i n the tortured papiamento that h e had learned in a few weeks and sometim es he would share his chickenhead soup prepared by the grea tgranddaughter with him she was a large black woman with solid bones the hips of a mare tea ts like live me lons and a round and perfect head armored with a hard surface of wiry hair which lo oked like a medieval warrior’s mail headdress her name was n igromanta in those days aureliano lived off the sale of silverware candlesticks and other bricabrac from t he house when he was pe nniless which was most of the time he got people in th e back of th e market to give him the chicken hea ds that they were going to throw awa y and he would take them to nigromanta to make her soups fortified wit h purslane and seasoned with mint when the greatgrandfather died aure liano stopped going by the house but he would run into nigrom anta under the dark alm ond trees on th e square using her wildanimal whistles to lure the few night owls many times he stayed with her speaking in papiamento about chickenhead soup and other dainties of misery and he would have ke pt right on if she had not let him know that his presence frightened off customers although he sometim es felt the tempta tion and although nigromanta herself might have seem ed to him as the natural culmination of a shared nostalgia he did not go t o bed with her so aureliano was still a virgin when amar anta úrsula returned to macondo an d gave him a sisterly emb race tha t left him breathless every tim e he sa w her and worse yet when sh e showed him the latest dances he felt the same spongy rele ase in his bones that had disturbed his greatgreatgrandfather when pilar ternera mad e her pretexts about th e cards in th e granary trying to squelch the torment he sank d eeper into the parchments and eluded the innocent flattery of that aunt wh o was poisoning his nights with a flow of tribulation but the more h e avoided her the more th e anxiety with which he wai ted for her stony laughter her howls of a happ y cat and her songs of gratitude agonizing in love at all hours and in the mo st unlikely parts of th e house one night thirty feet from his bed on the s ilver workbench the cou ple with unhinged bellies broke the bo ttles and ended up makin g love in a p ool of muriatic acid aureliano not only could not sleep for a single second but he spent the next day with a fever sobbing w ith rage the first night that he waited for nigromanta to come to the shadows of the almond trees it seemed like a n eternity pricked as he wa s by th e needles of uncertainty and clutching in his fist the peso and fifty cents that he had asked amaranta úrsula for not so mu ch because h e needed it as to involve her debase her prostitute her in his adve nture in so me way nigromanta took him to her room which was lighted with false candlesticks to her folding cot with the bedding stained from bad loves a nd to her bod y of a wild do g hardened and withou t soul which prepared itself to dismiss him as if he were a frightened child and suddenly it foun d a man whose tremend ous power demanded a movement of seismic readjustment from her insides they became lovers aureliano would spend his mornings deciphering parchments and at siesta time he would go to the bedroom where nigromanta was waitin g for him to teach him first how to do it like earthworms then like snails and finally lik e crabs until she had to leave him an d lie in wait for vagabond loves several weeks passed before au reliano discovered that around her waist sh e wore a small belt that seemed to be made out of a cello string but which was hard as steel and had no end as if it had been born and grown with he r almost al ways between loves th ey would eat naked in the bed in the hallucinating heat and un der the dayti me stars that the rust had caused to shine on the zinc ceiling it was the first time that nigromanta had had a stea dy man a bone crusher from head to toe as she herself said dying with laughter and she had even begun to get romantic illusions when aureliano confided in her about his repressed passion for a maranta úrsula which he had not been able to cure with the substitution but which was twisting him inside all the more as experience b roadened th e horizons o f love after th at nigromanta con tinued to receive him with the same wa rmth as ever but she ma de him pay fo r her services so strictly that when aureliano had no money she would make an addition to his bill which was not figured in numbers but by marks that she mad e with her th umbnail behind the door at sundown while she was drifting through the shadows in the square aureliano was going a long the porch like a st ranger scarc ely greeting amaranta ú rsula and ga ston who u sually dined at that time and sh utting herself up in his room again unable to read or write or even think b ecause of the a nxiety brought on by the laughter th e whispering the preliminary frolics and then the explosions of agonizing happiness that capped the nights in the house that was his life two years befo re gaston began to wait for the airplane and it went on the same way on the after noon that he went to the bookstor e of the wise catalonian and found four ranting boys in a heated argument a bout the methods used to kill cockroaches in the middle ages the old bookseller knowing about au reliano’s love for books that had been read only by the venerable bede urged him with a certain fatherly malice to get into the discussion and without even taking a breath he expla ined that the cockroach the oldest wi nged insect on the face of the earth had already been the victim of slippe rs in the old testa ment but that since the speci es was definitely resistant to any and all methods of extermination from tomato dices with borax to flour and sugar and with its one thou sand six hundred three v arieties had r esisted the most ancien t tenacious a nd pitiless persecution that mankind had unleas hed against any living thing since the beginnings including man himself to such an extent that just a s an instinct for reproduction was a t tributed to humankind so there must have b een another one more definite and pressing which was the instinct to kill cockroaches and if the latter had succeeded in escaping human ferocity it was because they had taken r efuge in the shadows wh ere they became invul nerable becau se of man’s congenital fear of the dark but on the other hand they became susceptible to the glow of noon so that b y the middle ages alread y and in present ti mes and per omnia se cula seculorum the o nly effective method for killing cockroaches was the glare of the sun that encyclopedic coin cidence was the beginning of a gre at friendship aureliano continued getting together in the afternoon with the four arguers w hose names were álvaro germán alfonso and gabriel the first and last friends that he ever had i n his life for a man like him holed up in written reality those stormy sessions that began in the bookstore and ended at dawn in the brothels were a revelation it had never occurred to him until then to think that literature was the best playthin g that had ever been invented to ma ke fun of pe ople as álvaro demonstrated during one night of revels some time woul d have to pa ss before aureliano realized th at su ch arbitrar y attitudes h ad their origins in the exa mple of the wise catalo nian for whom wisdom was worth nothing if it could not be used to invent a way of preparing chick peas the afternoon on which aureliano gave his lecture on cockroaches the argument ended up in the house of the girls who went to bed because of hunger a brothel of lies on the outskirts of macondo the proprietress was a smiling mamasanta tormented by a mania for opening and closing doors her eternal smile seemed to h ave been brought on by the credulity of her customers who accepted as s omething certain an esta blishment th at did not ex ist except in the imaginati on because even the tan gible things there were unreal the furniture that fell apart when one sat on it the disemboweled phonogra ph with a nesting hen i nside the garden of paper flowers the calend ars going back to the years before the arrival of the banana compa ny the frames with prints cut out of magazines that had never been published even the timid little whores who came from the neigh borhood when the proprietress informed them that customers had arrived they were nothing but an invention they would a ppear witho ut any greeti ng in their little flowered dresses left o ver from days when they were five years younger and they to ok them off with the sam e innocence with which they had put them on and in the paroxysms of love they would exclaim good heavens look how tha t roof is fallin g in and as s oon as they got their peso and fifty c ents they would spend it on a roll with cheese that the proprietress sold them smiling more than ever because only she knew that that meal was not true either aureliano whose world at th at tim e bega n with melq uíades’ parchments and ended in nigromanta’s bed found a stupid cure fo r timidity in the small imaginary brothel at first he could get nowhere in rooms where the proprietre ss would enter during the best mom ents of love and make all sorts of comments abo ut the intim ate charms of the prota gonists but with time h e began to get so familiar with t hose misfortunes of the world th at on one night that was more unbalanced than the others he got un dressed in th e small recep tion room an d ran through the hous e balancing a bottle of beer on his inconceivable ma leness he was the one who made fashionable the extravagances that the p roprietress celebrated wi th her eternal smile without protesting without believing in them just as when germá n tried to bu rn the house down to show that it did not exist and as when alfonso wrung the n eck of the parrot and threw it into th e pot where the chicken stew was beginning to boil although aureliano felt himself linked to the four friends by a common affection and a common solidarity even to th e poi nt where h e thought of them as if th ey were one person he was closer to gabriel than to th e oth ers the link was born on the night when he casu ally mentioned colonel aureliano buendía and gabriel was the only one who did not think that he was making fun of somebody even the proprietress who normally did not take part in the conv ersation argued with a madam’s wr athful passion that col onel aureliano buendía of whom she had indeed heard speak at some time was a figure invented by the government as a pretext for killing liberals gabriel on the other hand did not doubt the reality of col onel aureliano buendía because he had been a companion in arms and inseparable friend of his greatgreatgrandfather colonel gerineldo márquez those fickle tricks of memory were even more critical wh en the killing of the workers was brought up every time that aurelian o mentione d the ma tter not only th e proprietress but some people older than she would repudiate the myth of the workers hemmed in at the s tation and th e train with two hundred cars loaded with dead pe ople and they would even insist that after all everything had been set forth in ju dicial docu ments and i n primarysc hool textbooks that the banana com pany had never existed so that aureli ano and gabriel were linked by a kind of complic ity based on real facts that no one believed in and which had affected their lives to the point tha t both of them found themselves off course in the tide of a world that had ended and of which only the nostalgia remained gabriel would sleep wher ever time overtook him aureliano put him up several times in the silver workshop but he would spend his nights awake disturbed by the noise of the dead people who walked through the bedrooms until dawn later he turned him over to nigromanta who took hi m to her wel lused room when she wa s free and put down his a ccount with vertical marks behind the door in the f ew spaces lef t free by aur eliano’s debts in spite of their disordered life the whole grou p tried to do something permanent at the urging of the wise catalonian it was he with his experien ce as a former professor of classical literature and his storehouse of rare books who got them to sp end a whole night in search of the thirtyseventh dramatic situation in a town where no one ha d any interest any more in going beyond primary school fascinated by the discovery of friendship bewildered by the enchantments of a world which had been forbidden to him by fernanda’s mea nness aureliano abandoned the s crutiny of the parchments precisely when they were beginning to reve al themselves as predictions in coded lines of poetry but the subsequent proof th at there was time enough f or everythin g without ha ving to give up the brothels gave him the drive to return to me lquíades’ room having decided not to flag in his efforts until he had disco vered the las t keys tha t was during the time tha t gaston bega n to wait for the airplane and amaranta úrsula was so lonely th at one morni ng she appea red in the room “hello cannibal” she said to him “back in your cave again” she was irresistible with a dress she had designed and one o f the long shadvertebra necklaces that she hers elf had mad e she had s topped using th e leash convinced of her husband’s faithfulness and for the first time since her return she seem ed to have a moment of ea se aureliano d id not need to see her to know that she had arrived she pu t her elbows on the table so close and so helpless that aureliano heard th e deep soun d of her bo nes and she becam e interested in th e parchments trying to overcome his disturbance he grasped at the voice that he was losing the life that was leaving him the memory that was turning into a petrified polyp and he spoke to her about the priestly destiny of sanskrit the sc ientific possibilit y of seeing the future showing through in time as one sees what is written on the back of a sh eet of paper through the light the necessity o f deciphering the predictions so tha t they woul d not defea t thems elves and the centuries of nostradamu s and the destruction of cantabria pr edicted by saint milanus suddenly without interrupting the cha t moved by an impulse that had been sleeping in him since his origins aureliano pu t his hand on hers think ing that that final decision would put a n end to his doubts she grabbed his index finger with the affectionate in nocence with which she h ad done so i n childhood however an d she h eld it while he kept on answer ing questions they remained like that linked by icy index fingers that did not transmi t anything in any way un til she awok e from her momentar y dream and slapped her f orehead with her hand “the ants” she exclaimed and th en she forgot about the m anuscripts went to the door with a dance step and from th ere she threw aureliano a kiss with the tips of her fingers as she had said goodbye to her father on the afternoon when they sent her to brussels “you can tell me later” she said “i fo rgot that today’s the day to put quicklime on the anthills” she continued going to the room occasionally when she had something to do in that part of the house and sh e would stay there for a few minutes wh ile her husband continued to scrutinize the sky encouraged by that chan ge aureliano stayed to eat with the family at that time as he had not don e since the first months of amaranta úrsula’s retu rn gaston wa s pleased d uring the co nversations after meals which usuall y went on for more than an hour he complained that his partners wer e deceiving him they had informed him of the loadin g of the airplane on board a ship that did not arrive and although his shipping agents insisted th at it would never arrive because it was not on the list of caribbean ships his partners insisted that the shipment was correct and they even insinuated that gaston was lying to them in his letters th e correspondence reached s uch a degree of mutual suspicion that gaston decided not to write again and he began to suggest the possibility of a quick trip to brussels to clear things up and return with the airplane the plan evaporated however a s soon as amaranta úrsula reiterated her decision not to mov e from macondo even if she lost a husband during the first days aureliano shared the general opinion that gaston was a fool on a velocipede and that brought on a vag ue feeling of pity later when he obtained deep er information on the natur e of men in the brothels he thought that gaston’s meekness had its origins in unbridled passion but when he came to know him better an d realized h is true character was th e opposite of his submissive conduct he conceived the malicious suspicion that even the wait for the airplane was an act then he thought that gaston was not as f oolish as he appeared but quite the co ntrary was a man of infinite steadiness ability and patience who had s et about to conquer his wife with th e weariness of eternal agreement of never saying no of simulating a limitless conformity letting her become enm eshed in her own web un til the day sh e could no lo nger bear th e tedium of the illusions close at hand and would pack the bags herself to go back to europe aureliano’s former pity turned into a violen t dislike gaston’s system seemed so p erverse to hi m but at the same tim e so effective that he ventured to warn amaranta úrsula she made fun of his suspicio ns however without even noticing the heavy weight of love uncertainty and jeal ousy that he had inside it had not occurred to her that she was arousing something more than fra ternal affection in aureliano until she pricked her finger trying to open a can of pe aches and he dash ed over to suck the bloo d out with a n avidity and a devotion that sent a chi ll up her spine “aureliano” she laughed disturbed “y ou’re too suspicious to be a good bat” then aureliano went all out giving her some small orphaned kisses in the hollow of he r wounded hand he opened up the most hidden passageways of his heart and drew out an interminable and lacerated intestine the terrible pa rasitic animal that ha d incubated in his mar tyrdom he told her how he would get up at mi dnight to weep in loneliness and rage over the underwear that she had left to dry in the bathroo m he told her about the anxiety with which he had asked nigromanta to ho wl like a cat and sob gast on gaston gaston in his ea r and with how much astuteness he had rans acked her vials of perfume so that he could smell it on the neck s of the littl e girls who w ent to bed because of hunger frigh tened by the passion of that outb urst amaranta úrsula was closing her fingers contracting them lik e a shellfish until her w ounded hand free o f all pain and an y vestige of pity was co nverted into a knot of emeralds and topazes and stony and unfeeling bones “fool” she s aid as if she were spitting “i’m sailin g on the first ship leaving for belgium” álvaro had come to the wise catalonian’s book store one of those afternoons proclaiming at the top of his lungs his latest discovery a zoological brothel it was called the golden child and it was a huge open air salon th rough which no less th an two hundr ed bitterns who told th e time with a deafening cackling strolled at will in wire pens that surrounded the dance floor and a mong large amazonian camellias there were her ons of different colors crocodiles as fat as pigs s nakes with twelve rattl es and a turtl e with a gilded shell who dove in a s mall artificial ocean ther e was a big white dog meek and a pederast wh o would give stud services nevertheles s in order to be fed the atmosphere had an innocent denseness as if it ha d just been cr eated and the beautiful mulatto girls who waited hopelessly among the bloodred peta ls and the outmoded phonograph records knew ways of love that man h ad left behind forgotten in the earthly paradise the first night that the group visite d that greenhouse of illusions the spl endid and taciturn old woman who g uarded the entrance in a wicker rocking chair felt that tim e was turning back to its earliest origins when among the five who were arriving she saw a bony jaundiced man with tartar cheekbones marked forever and from the beginning of the world with the pox of solitude “lord lord ” she sighed “aureliano” she was s eeing colonel aureliano b uendía once more as she had seen him in the light of a lamp long before the wars lo ng before the desolatio n of glory and the exile of disillusionment tha t remote dawn when he went to her bedroom to give the first command of his life the command to give him love it was pilar ternera years before when she h ad reached on e hundred fortyfive years of age she had given up the perniciou s custom of keeping track of her age and she went on living in the static an d marginal time of memories in a fu ture perfectly revealed and established beyond th e futures disturbed by the i nsidious snares and suppositions of her cards from that ni ght on aurel iano took refuge in the compassionate tend erness and understa nding of his unknown greatgreatgrandmother sitting in he r wicker ro cking chair she would recall the past reconstruct the grandeur and misf ortunes of the family and the splendor of macondo which was now erased while álvaro frightened the crocodile s with his n oisy laughter and alfons o invented outlandish stories about the bittern s who had pecked ou t the eyes of four customers who misbehaved the week before and gabriel was in th e room of the pensive mulatto girl who did not collect in m oney but in l etters to a s muggler boyfriend who was in priso n on the oth er side of th e orinoco because the bor der guards had caught hi m and had made him sit on a chamberpot that filled up with a mixture of shit an d diamonds that true brothel wi th that maternal proprietress was the world of which aureliano had dreamed during his prolonged captivity he felt so well so close to perfect co mpanionship that he tho ught of no other refuge on the afternoon on which amaranta úrsula had made his ill usions crumble he was ready to u nburden himself with words so th at someone co uld break th e knots that bound his chest but he only ma naged to let out a fluid warm and restorati ve weeping in pilar ternera’s lap she let him finish scratching his head with the tips of her fingers and witho ut his having revealed that he was weeping from love she recognized immediately the oldest so bs in the history of man “it’s all right child” she consoled him “now tell me who it is” when aureliano told her pilar ternera let out a d eep laugh the old expansive laugh that ended up as a cooing of doves there was no mystery in the heart of a buendía that was impenetrable for her because a cen tury

of her bath aureliano saw her go by his room with a robe of soft folds and a towel wrapped around her head like a turban he followed her almost on tiptoes stumbling from drunke nness and he went into the nuptial bedroom just as she op ened the robe a nd closed it ag ain in frigh t he made a silent signal toward the next room where the doo r was half o pen and wh ere aureliano knew th at gaston was beginning to write a letter “go away” she said voicelessly aureliano smiled picked her up by the wais t with both hands like a pot of begonias and dropped her on her back on the bed with a brutal tug he pulled off her bathrobe before she had time to resist and he loo med over an abyss of n ewly washed nudity whos e skin color lines of fuzz and hidden moles had all been imag ined in the shadows of the other rooms amaranta úrsula defended herself sincerely with the as tuteness of a wise woma n weaseling her slippery flexible and fragrant weasel’s body as she tried to knee him in the kidneys and scorpion his face with her nails but without either of them giving a gasp that mi ght not h ave been tak en for that brea thing of a person watching the meager april sunset through th e open window it was a fierce fight a battle to the dea th but it seemed to be wi thout violence be cause it cons isted of disto rted attacks and ghostly evasions slow cautious solemn so that during it all there wa s time for the petunias to bloom and for gaston to forget abo ut his aviato r’s dream in the next roo m as if they were two enemy lovers seeking reconciliation at the bottom of an aquarium in the heat of that savage and ceremonious struggle amaranta úrsul a understood that her m eticulous silence was so irrational that it could awaken the s uspicions of her nearby husband much more than the sound o f warfare that they were trying to avoid then she began to lau gh with her lips tight together without giving up the fight but defending herself with false bites an d deweaselin g her body little by littl e until they both were conscious of being adversaries and accomplices at the same ti me and the affray degenerated into a conventional gambol and the atta cks became caresse s suddenly almost playfully like one more bit of mischief amaranta ú rsula dropped her defense and when she tried to recover frightened by what she herself had ma de possible it was t oo late a great commotion immobilized her in her center of gravity planted her in her place and her defensive will wa s demolished by the irresistible anxiety to discover what the orange whistles and the invisible globes on th

bookstore and returned to the mediterranean village where he had been born overcome by a yearning fo r a lasting springtime no o ne could h ave foreseen hi s decision he had arrived in macondo during the splendor of the banana company fleeing from on e of many wars and nothing more practical had occurred to him than to set up that bookshop of incunabula and first editions in several languages which casual customers would thumb through cautiousl y as if they were junk books as they waited their turn to have their dreams interpr eted in the h ouse across the way he s pent half his life in the back of the store scribbling in his ext racareful ha nd in purple ink and on pages that he tore out of school notebooks and no one was sure exactly what he was writing when aureliano first met him he had two boxes of t hose motley pages that in some way made on e think of melquíades’ parchments and from that time until he left he ha d filled a third one so it was reasonable to believe that he had done nothi ng else during his st ay in macondo the only people with whom he maintained relations were the four friends whom he had exch anged their tops and kites for books and he set them to reading seneca and ovid while they were sti ll in grammar school he treated the classical writers with a household familiarity as if they had all been his roommates at some period and he knew many things that should not have b een known such as the fact tha t saint augustine wore a wool jacket und er his habit that he did n ot take off for fourteen years and th at arnaldo o f villanova the necromancer was impotent since child hood because of a scorpion bite hi s fervor for the written word was an interweavin g of solemn respect and gossipy irreverence not even his own manuscripts were safe from that dualism having le arned catala n in order to translate them alfonso put a roll of pages in his pockets which were always full of newspaper cli ppings and manuals for strange trades and one night he lost them in the h ouse of the little girls who went to b ed because of hunger when the wise old grandfather found out in stead of r aising a row as had b een feared he commented dying with laughter that it was the na tural destiny of literature on the other hand there was no human power capable of persuading him not to take along the three boxes when he returned to his native village and he unleashed a string of carthaginian curses at the railroad inspectors who tried to ship them as freight until he finally succeeded in keeping them with him i n the pass enger coach “th e world mus t be all fucked up” he s aid then “when men travel first clas s and literature goes as freight” that was the last th ing he was heard to say he had spent a dark week on the final preparations for the trip because as the hour approached his humor was breaking down and things began to be misplaced a nd what h e put in one p lace would a ppear in ano ther atta cked by the sam e elves that ha d tormented fernanda “collons ” he would curse “i shit on canon twentyseven of the synod of london” germán and aureliano took care of him they he lped him like a child fastening his tickets an d immigration documents to his pockets with safety pins making him a detailed list of what he must do from the time he left macondo until he landed in barcelona but nonetheless he th rew away a pair of pants with half of his money in it withou t realizing it the night before the trip after nailing up the boxes and putting his clothing into the same suitcase that he had brought when he first came he narrowed his clam eyes pointed with a kind of impudent benediction at the stacks of books with which he had endured during his exile and said to his friends “all that shit there i leave to you peop le” three months later they received in a large en velope twentynine letters and more than fifty pictures that he had accu mulated during the leisure of the high seas althou gh he did not date them the order in which he had written the letters was obv ious in the first ones with his customary good humor he s poke about the difficulties of the cro ssing the urge he h ad to throw the ca

thou ght it was a number tha t had no end and th e bet th at he had won du ring the first dinner because he had recognized in the drinking water on board the taste of the nighttime beets b y the springs of lérida with the passage of the days however the reality of life on board mattered less and less to him and even the mo st recent an d trivial happenings seemed worthy of nostalgia because as the ship got farther away his memory began to grow sad that process of nostalgia was also evident in the pictures in the first ones he looked happy with his sport shirt which look ed like a hos pital jacket and his snowy mane in an october caribbean f illed with whitecaps in the last ones he could be seen to be wearing a dark coat an d a milk scarf pale in the face taciturn from absen ce on the deck of a mournful ship that h ad come to b e like a sleep walker on th e autumnal s eas germán and aureli ano answered his letters he wrote so many during th e first months that a t that time th ey felt closer to him th an when he had been in macondo and th ey were almo st freed from the ran cor that he ha d left behind at first he told them that everything was just the same that the pink snails were still in the house where he had been born that the dry h erring still had the same taste on a pi ece of toast that the waterfalls in the village still took on a perfumed smell at dusk they were the notebook pages again woven with the purple scribbling in which he dedicated a s pecial paragraph to each one nevertheless and although he himself did not seem to notice it thos e letters of r ecuperation and stimulation were slowly changing into pastor al letters of disenchantment one winter night while the soup was boiling in the fire place he missed the heat of the back of his store the buzzing of the sun on the dusty a lmond trees the whistle of the train during the lethar gy of sie sta time just as in macon do he had missed the winter soup in th e fireplace the cries of th e coffee ven dor and th e fleeting larks of springtime upset by two nostal gias facing each other like two mirrors he lost his marvelous sense of unreality and he ended up recommen ding to all of them that they leave macondo th at they forget everything he had taugh t them a bout the world a nd the huma n heart that they shit on horace and that wher ever they might be they alwa ys remember that the pas t was a lie that memory has no return that every spring gone by could never be recovered and that the wildest and most ten acious love was an ephemeral truth in the end álvaro was the first to take the advice to aband on macondo he sold everything even the tam e jaguar that teased pass ersby from the courtyard of his house and he boug ht an eternal ticket o n a train that never stopped traveling in the postcards that he sent from the way stations he would describe with shouts the instantaneou s images tha t he had seen from the window of his coach and it was as if he were tearing up and throwing into oblivion some long evanescent poem th e chimerica l negroes in the co tton f ields of louisiana the winged horses in the bluegrass of kentucky the greek lovers in the infernal sunsets of arizona the girl in the red sweater p ainting watercolors by a lake in michi gan who wa ved at him with her brush es not to say farewell bu t out of hope because she did not know that she was watching a trai n with no return passing by then alfonso and germán left one saturday with the idea of co ming back on monday but nothing more was ever heard of them a year after the depar ture of the wi se catalonian the only one left in macondo was gabriel still adrift at the mercy of nigromanta ’s chancy ch arity and answering the questions of a contest in a french magazine in which the first pr ize was a trip to paris aureliano who was the one who subscribed to it helped him fill in the answer s sometimes in his house but most of the time among the ceramic bottles and atmos phere of valeri an in the only pharmacy left in macondo where mercedes gabriel’s stealthy girl friend lived it was the l ast tha t remained of a past whos e annihilation had not taken place because it was still in a proc ess of annihilation consuming itself from within ending at every momen t but neve r ending its ending the town had rea ched such extremes of inactivity th at when gab riel won th e contes t and left for paris with two changes of clothing a pair of shoes and th e com plete works of rabelais he had to sig nal the engineer to stop the train and pick him up the old street of the t urks was at that

sold the last yard of diagonal cloth and in the shadowy showcases only th e decapitated manikins remained the banana com pany’s city which patricia brown may have tried to evoke for he r grandchildren during t he nights of intolerance and dill pick les in prattville alabama was a plain of wild grass the anci ent priest who had taken father angel’s place an d whos e name no one had bothered to find out awaited god’s mercy stretched ou t casually in a hammock tortured by arthritis and the insomnia of doubt while the lizards and rats fought over the inheritance of th e nearby chur ch in that macondo forgotten even by the birds where the dust and th e heat had b ecome so strong that it was difficult to brea the secluded by solitude and love and by the solitude of love in a house where it was almost impossibl e to sleep beca use of the n oise of the red ants aureliano and amaranta úrsula were th e only h appy beings and the most hap py on the face of the earth gaston had returned to brussels tired of w aiting for t he airplane one day he put his indispensable things into a small suitcase took his file of correspondence and left with the idea of returning by air before his concession was turned over to a group of german pilots who had presented th e provincial authorities with a more ambitious project th an his since th e afternoon of their first love aureliano and amar anta úrsula had continu ed taking advantage of her husband’ s rare unguarded moments making love with gagged ardor in chance meeti ngs and almost always interrupted by unexpected returns but when they saw th emselves alone in the house they succumbed to the delirium of lovers who were ma king up for lost time it was a mad passion unhinging w hich made f ernanda’s bones tremble with horror in her grave and which kept them in a state of perp etual excitement am aranta úrsula’s shrieks her songs of agony would break out the same at two i n the afternoon on the di ningroom tabl e as at two in the morning in the pan try “what hurts me most” she would say laughing “is all th e time that we was ted” in the bewi lderment of passion she watched the ants devastating the garden sating their prehistoric hunger with the beam of the house and she watched the torrents of living lava take ov er the porch again but she bothered to fight them only when she found them in her b edroom aureliano aband oned the p archments did not leave the house again and carelessly answered the letters from the wise catalonia n they lost their sense of reality the notion of time the rhythm of daily habits they closed th e doors and windows again so as not to waste time getting undressed and they wa lked about the house as remedios th e beauty ha d wanted to do and they would roll around naked in the m ud of the courtyard and one afternoon they al most drowned as th ey made love in the cistern in a short ti me they did more damage than the red ants they destroyed the furniture in the parlor in their madness they tore to shreds the hammock th at had resisted the sad bivouac loves of colonel aureliano buendía and they disemb oweled th e mattresses a nd emptied them on th e floor as they suffocated in storms of cotton although aureliano was just as ferocious a lover as his rival it was amaranta úrsula who ruled in that paradise of disaster with her mad ge nius and her lyrical vorac ity as if she had concentrated in her love the unconquerable energy that her greatgreatgrandmother had given to the makin g of little candy animals and yet wh ile she was singing with pleasure and dying with laughter over her own inventions au reliano was b ecoming more and more absorbed and silent for his passion was selfcentered and b urning neve rtheless they both reached such extremes of virtuosity that when they beca me ex hausted from excitem ent they woul d take adva ntage of thei r fatigue they would give themselves over to the worship of t heir bodies discovering t hat the res t periods of lo ve had unexplored possibilities much richer than those of desire while h e would rub amaranta úrsula’s erect b reasts with egg whites or smooth her elastic thighs and pea chlike stomach with cocoa butter she would play with aureliano’s portentous creature as if it were a doll and would paint clown’ s eyes on it with her lipstick and give it a turk’s mustache with her eyebrow pencil a nd would put on organza bow ties and little tinfoil hats one night they daub ed themselves from head to toe with peach jam an d licked each other like dogs and made mad love on the floor of the porch and they wer e awakened by a torrent of carnivor ous ants who were ready to eat th em al ive during the pauses in their delirium amaranta úr sula would answer gaston ’s letters she felt him to be so far a way and busy that his return seemed impossible to her in one of his first letters he told her that his partners had actually sent the airplane but that a shipping agen t in brussels had sent it by mistake to tanganyika where i t was delivered to the sca ttered tribe of the makondo s that mix up brought on so many difficulties that just to ge t the plane b ack might tak e two years so amaranta úrsula dismissed the pos sibility of an inopportune return au reliano for his part had no other contact with the world except for the letters from the wise catalonian a nd the news he had of gabriel thro ugh mercedes the silent pharmacist at first they were real co ntacts g abriel had turned in his return ticket in or der to stay in paris selling the old newspapers and empty bottles that the chambermai ds threw out of a gloomy hotel on the rue dauphine aureliano could visualize him then in a turtleneck sweater which he took off only when the sidewalk ca fés on montpar nasse filled with springtime lovers and sleeping by day and writ ing by night in order to confuse hunger in the room that s melled of boiled cauliflower where r ocamadour was to die nevertheless news about him was slowly becom ing so uncertain and th e letters from the wise man so sporadic and melancholy that aureli ano grew to think about them as amaranta ú rsula thought about her husband and both of them remained floating in an empty universe where the only everyday and eternal reality was love suddenly like the stamp ede in that world of happy unawareness came the news of gaston’s return aureliano and amaranta úrs ula opened their eyes dug deep into their souls looked at the letter wi th their hands on their hearts and understo od that they were so clos e to each other that the y preferred death to s eparation then s he wrote her husband a l etter of con tradictory tru ths in which she repeated her love and said how anxious she wa s to s ee him again but at the sa me time sh e admitted as a design of fate the impossibility of living without aure liano contrary to what they had expected g aston sent them a calm almost patern al reply with two whole pages devoted to a warning against the fickleness of passion and a fina l paragraph with unmista kable wishes for them to be as happy as he had been during his brief conjug al experience it was such an unforeseen attitude that amaranta úrsula felt humiliated by the idea that she had given her husband the pr etext that he had wanted i n order to abandon her to her fate the rancor was aggravated six months later when gaston wrote again from léopoldville where he had finally recovere d the airplane simply to ask them to ship him the velocipede which of all that he had left behind in macondo was the only thing that had any sentimental value for him aureliano bore am aranta úrsula’s spite patien tly and made an effort to show her that he could be as good a husband in a dversity as in prosperity and the dail y needs that b esieged them when gaston’s last money ran out created a bond of solidarity between them tha t was not as dazzling and heady as passion but that let them make love as much and be as happy as during their uproarious and salacious days at the time pilar ternera died they were expecting a child in the lethar gy of her pregnancy amaranta úrsula tried to set up a business in necklaces mad e out of the ba ckbones of fish but exce pt for merced es who bought a dozen she could not find any customers aureliano was aware for the first time that his gift for languages his encyclopedi c knowledge his rare faculty for remembering the d etails of remote deeds and places without having been th ere were as useless as th e box of genuine j ewelry th at his wife owned which mu st have b een worth as much as all the money tha t the last inhabitants of macondo could have put together they survived miraculously al though amaranta úrsula did not los e her good humor or her genius for erotic mischief she acquired the habit of sitting on the porch after lunch in a kind of wakeful and thoughtful siesta aurelia no would accompany her sometimes they woul d remain th ere in silence until nightfall opposite each other looking into each other’s eyes loving each other as much as i n their scandal ous days th e uncertainty of the future made them turn their hearts to ward the past they saw th emselves in the lost paradise of the deluge splashing in the puddles in the courtyard killing lizards to hang on úrsula pretending that they were going to bury her alive and thos e memories revealed to th em the truth that they had been hap py together ever since they had had memory going deeper into the pas t amaranta úrsula remembered the afternoon on which she had gone into the silver shop and her mother told he r that little aur eliano was nobody’s child because he had been fo und floating in a basket although the version seemed unlik ely to th em they did no t have any information en abling them to replace it with the true one all tha t they were s ure of after examining an the possibilities was that fernanda was not aureliano’s mother amaranta úrsula was inclined to believe that he was the son of p etra cotes of whom she remembered only tales of infamy and that supposition produced a twinge of horror in her heart tormented by the certai nty tha t he was his wife’s brother aureliano ran out to the parish house to search through the moldy and motheaten archiv es for some clue to his parentage the oldest baptismal certificate that he found wa s that of am aranta buen día baptized in adolescen ce by father nicanor reyna during the time wh en he was trying to prove the existence of god by mea ns of tricks with chocola te he began to have that feeling that he was on e of the seven teen aurelianos whos e birth certificates he track ed down as he went thro ugh four volumes but the baptism dates were too far back for his age seeing him lost in the labyrint hs of kinship trembling with uncertai nty the arth ritic priest who was watching him from his ha mmock asked him compassionately what his name was “aureliano buendía” he said “then don’t wear yourself out searching” the prie st exclaimed with final conviction “many years ago there us ed to be a street h ere with that na me and in those days people had th e custom of naming their children after streets” aureliano trembled with rage “so” he said “you don’t believe it either” “believe what” “that colonel aureliano buendía fought thirtytwo civil wars and lost them all” aureliano answered “that the ar my hemm ed in and machin egunned three thous and workers and that th eir bodies were carried off to be thrown i nto the sea o n a train with two hundred cars” the priest m easured him with a pityin g look “oh my son” he signed “it’s enough for me to be sure that you and i exist at this moment” so aureliano and amaran ta úrsula accepted the v ersion of the basket not because they believed it but becau se it spared them their terror as th e pregnancy a dvanced they were beco ming a single being they were becomi ng more and more integrated in the s olitude of a house that n eeded only one last breath to b e knocked down they rest ricted th emselves to an essential area from fernanda’s bedroom where the cha rms of sedentar y love were visible to the beginning of the porch where amaran ta úrsula would sit to s ew bootees an d bonnets f or the newb orn baby an d aureliano would answer the occasion al letters from the wise catalonian the rest of the house wa s given over t o the tenacious assault of destruction the silver shop melquíades’ room the primitive and silent realm of santa sofía de la piedad remain ed in the depths of a domestic jungle that no one would have had the cou rage to pen etrate surro unded by th e voracity o f nature au reliano and amaranta ú rsula continued cultivating the oregano and the begonias and defended thei r world with demarcation s of quicklime building the last tren ches in the a geold war between man and ant her long and neglected hair the splotches that were begi nning to appear on her face the s welling of her legs the deformation of her former lovemaking weasel’s bod y had changed amaranta úrsula from the youthful creature she had been wh en she arrive d at the house with the cage of luckless canaries and her captive husband but it did not change th e vivacity of her spirit “shit” she would say laughingly “who would have thought that we really would end up living like cannibals” the last thread th at joined them to the world was br oken on the sixth month of pregnancy when they received a letter th at obv iously was n ot from the wi se catalonian it had b een mailed in barcelona but the env elope was ad dressed in co nventional blue ink by an official hand and it had the innocent and impersonal look of hostile messages aureliano snatched it out of amaranta úrsula’s hands as she was abo ut to open it “not this one” he told her “i d on’t want to kno w what it sa ys” just as he had sensed the wise catalonian did not write again the stra nger’s letter which no one read was lef t to the mer cy of th e moths on the shelf where fernanda ha d forgotten her wedding ring on occasion and there it remained consuming it self in the inner fire of its bad news as th e solitary lovers sailed against the tide of those days of the last stages those impenitent and illfate d times which were squandered on the useless effort of making them drift toward the desert of disenchantment and oblivion aware of that mena ce aurelian o and amara nta úrsula s pent th e hot months holding hands ending with the love of loyalty for the child who had his beginning in the madness of fornication at night holding each other in b ed they were not frightened by th e sublunary explosions of the ants or the noise of the moths or the constan t and clean whistle of the growth of the weeds in th e neighboring rooms many times they were awak ened by the traffic of the dead they could hear úrsula fighting against the la ws of creation to m aintain the li ne and josé arcadio buendía searchin g for the mythical truth o f the great in ventions an d fernanda praying and colonel aureliano buendía stupefying himself with the decep tion of war and the little gold fishes and aureliano segundo d ying of so litude in the turmo il of his debauches an d then they learned tha t dominant obsessions can prevail against death and they were h appy again with the certai nty that they would go on loving each other in th eir shape as apparitions long after other species of future animal s would steal from the insects the parad ise of misery that th e insects were final ly stealing from man one sunday at six in the afternoon amaranta ú rsula felt the pangs of childbirth the smiling mistress of the little girls who went to bed beca use of hunger had her get onto the diningroom table straddl ed her stom ach and mis treated h er with wild gallops until her cries were drowned out by the bellows of a formidable male child throug h her tears amaranta úrsula could see that he was one of those great buendías strong a nd willful lik e the josé arcadios with the open and clairvoyant eyes of the aurelianos and predisposed to begin the race again from the beginning and cleanse it of its pernicious vices and solitary calling fo r he was the only one in a century who had been engendered with love “he’s a real cannibal” she said “we’ll name him r odrigo” “no” her husband coun tered “we’ll name him aureliano and he’ll win thirtytwo wars ” after cutting the umbilical cord the m idwife began to use a cloth to take off the blue gre ase that covered his body as aur eliano held u p a lamp only when they turned him on his stomach did they see tha t he h ad somethin g more than other m en an d they lea ned over to examine him it was the tail of a pig they were not alarmed aureliano and amaranta úr sula were not aware of the family precedent nor did they remember úrsula’s frightening adm onitions and the midwi fe pacified them with th e idea that th e tail could be cut off when the child got his second teeth th en they had no time to think about it again beca use amaranta úrsula was bleeding in an uncontain able torrent they tried to help her with applications of spider webs and balls of ash but it was lik e trying to hold back a spring with one’s hands during the first hours she tried to maintain her good humor she took the frightened aureliano by the hand and begged him not to worr y because p eople like her were not made to die against their will and s he exploded with laughter at the ferocious remedies of the midwife but as aureliano’s hope abandoned him s he was becoming less visible as if the light on her were fading away until s he sank into drowsiness at dawn on monday they brought a woman who recited cauterizing prayers that were infallible fo r man and beast beside her bed but amaranta úrsula’s passionate blood was insensible to any ar tifice that di d not come from love in the after noon after twentyfour hours of desperation they knew that she was dead because th e flow ha d stopped wi thout remedies and her profile became s harp and the blotches on her face evaporated in a halo of alabaster and she smiled again aureliano di d not und erstand until then how mu ch he loved his friends how much he missed them and how much he would have given to be with them at that momen t he put the child in the basket that his mother had prepared for him cove red the face of the corpse with a blanket and wandered ai mlessly through the town searching fo r an entrance that went back to the past he knocked at the door of the pharmacy where he had not visited lately an d he found a carpenter shop the old woman who opened the door with a lamp in her hand took pity on his delirium and insisted that no there had never been a pharmac y there nor had she ever known a woman with a thin neck an d sleepy eyes named mercedes he wept leaning his brow aga inst the d oor of the wise catalonian’s former bookstore conscious that he wa s paying with his tard y sobs for a death that he had refused to weep for on time so as not to break the spell of love he smashed his fists against the cement wall of the golden child calling for pilar te rnera indifferent to the luminous orange disks that were cr ossing the sky and that so many ti mes on holiday nights he had contemplated with childish fascination from the courtya rd of the cu rlews in the last open sa lon of the tumbledown redlight dist rict an accordion group was playing th e songs of rafael escal ona the bishop’s nephew heir to the secrets of francisco the man th e bartender who had a withered and somewh at crumpled

aureliano spoke to him about the misfortune of his heart wi thered and somewh at crumpled for having been raised against his sister they ended up weep ing together and aureliano felt for a moment tha t the p ain was over but when he was alone agai n in the last dawn of macondo he opened up his arms in the middle of the square ready to wake up the whol e world and he shouted with all his might “friends are a bunch of bastards” nigromanta rescued him from a pool of vomit an d tears she took him to her room cleaned him up made hi m drink a cup of broth thinking that it would con sole him she took a piece of charcoal and erased the innumerable loves that he still owed her for an d she voluntarily brought up her own most solitary sadnesses so as not to lea ve him al one in his weepi ng when he awoke after a dull and brief sleep aureliano recovered the awareness of his headach e he open ed his eyes an d remember ed the child he could not find the ba sket at first he felt an outburst of joy thinking t hat amaranta úrsula had awakened from death to take care of the chil d but her c orpse was a pile of stone s under the blanket awa re that when he arrived h e had fo und the door to the bedr oom open aurel iano went across the p orch which was saturated with the m orning sighs of oregano and looked into the dining room where the remnants of the birth still lay the large pot the bloody sheets the jars o f ashes and the twisted umbilical cord of the child on an opened diaper on the table next to the shears and the fishline the idea that th e midwife had returned for the child during the night gave him a pause of rest in which to think he sank into the rocking chair the same one in which rebeca ha d sat during the early days of the hou se to give embroidery lessons and in which amaranta had pl ayed chines e checkers with colonel gerineldo márquez and in which amaranta úrsula had sewn the tin y clothing for the child an d in that flas h of lucidity he beca me aware tha t he was unable to bear in hi s soul the crushing weight of so much past wounded by the fatal lances of his own nostalgia and that of others he admired the persistence of the spider webs on the dead rose bushes the perseverance of the rye grass the patience of the air in the ra diant february dawn and then he saw the child it was a dry an d bloated ba g of skin that all the an ts in the world were dragging toward their holes along the stone path in the garden aureliano could not move not beca use he was paralyzed by horror but because at that prodigious instant melquí ades’ final keys were revealed to hi m and he sa w the epigraph of the parchments perfectly pla ced in the order of man’s time and space the first of the line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by the ants aureliano had never been more lucid in any act of his life as w hen he forgot about his dead ones and the pain of his dead ones and nailed up the doors and wi ndows again with fernan da’s crossed boards so as not to be dis turbed by any temptations of the worl d for he knew then that his fate was written in melquíades’ parchments he found them intact am ong the prehistoric plants and steamin g puddles and luminous insects that h ad removed all trace of ma n’s passage on earth fro m the room and he did n ot have th e calmness to b ring them out into th e light but right there standi ng withou t the slightest difficulty as if th ey had b een written i n spanish and were being read under the dazzling splendor of high noon he began to d ecipher them al oud it was the history of the family written b y melquíades down to th e most trivial details one hundred yea rs ahead of time he had written it in sanskrit which was his mother tongue and he had encoded the even lines in the private cipher o f the emperor augustus and the odd ones in a la cedemonian military code the final protection which aureli ano had begun to glimpse when he l et himself be confused by the love of amaranta úrsula was based on the fact that melquíades had not put even ts in the order of man’s conventional time but ha d concentra ted a cen tury of daily ep isodes in such a way that they co existed in on e instant fascinated by the discovery aureliano read aloud without skipping the chanted encyclicals that melquía des himself had made arcadio listen to and that were in reality the prediction of hi s execution and he found the announcement of the bi rth of the most beautiful woman in the world who was rising up to heaven in bod y and soul and he found the origin o f the posthu mous twins who gave up deciphering the parch ments not sim ply through incapacity an d lack of drive but also because th eir attemp ts were premature at that point impatient to know his own origin aurelian o skipped ahea d then th e wind began warm incipien t full of voices from the past the murmurs of ancient geraniums sighs of disenchantment tha t preceded the most tenacio us nostalgia he did not notice it b ecause at that moment h e was discover ing the first indications of his own being in a lascivious grandfather who let himself be frivolo usly dragged along across a hallucinated plateau i n search of a beautiful woman who woul d not make him happy aureliano recognized him he pursued the hidden paths of his descent and he found the instant of his own conception among the scorpions and the yellow butterflies in a sunset b athroom wh ere a mecha nic satisfied his lust on a woman who was giving herself out of rebellion he wa s so absorbed that he did not feel the second surge of wind either as its cyclonic str ength tore the doors an d windows o ff their hinges pulled off the roof of the eas t wing and uprooted the founda tions only then did h e discover that amaranta úrsula was not his sister but his aunt and that sir francis drake had attacked riohacha only so tha t they could seek each o ther through the most intric ate labyrinth s of blood until they wou ld engender the mythological animal that was to bring the line to an end macon do was already a fearful whirlwind of dust and rubble being spun about by the wrath of the biblical hurric ane when aureliano skipped eleven pages so as not to lose time with facts he knew only too well and he began to decipher the instant that he was living d eciphering it as he lived it prophesying himself in the act of deciphering the last page of the parchmen ts as if he were looking into a speaking mirror then he skipped again to anticipa te the predictio ns and ascer tain th e date and circums tances of his death before reaching the final line however he had already understood that he would never leave that room for it was foreseen tha t the city of mirrors or mirages would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the mem ory of men a t the precis e moment wh en aureliano babilonia would finish deciphering the parch ments and tha t everything written on them was unrepeatable since time
