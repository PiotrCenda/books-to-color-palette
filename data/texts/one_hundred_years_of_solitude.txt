ANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that 
distant after noon when his father took him to discov er ice. At that time Macondo was a village of 
twenty adob e houses, built on the ba nk of a river of clear water that ran a long a bed of polished 
stones, which were white and enormo us, like prehis toric eggs. T he world was so recen t that many 
things lacked names, and  in order to i ndicate them  it was  necessary to point. Every year during the 
month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great 
uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would displa y new inventions. First they brought the magnet.  
A heavy gyp sy with  an u ntamed bear d and sparro w hands, w ho introduced himself as Melquíades, 
put on a bol d public demonstration of what he hims elf called the eighth wonder of the learned al -
chemists of Macedonia. He went from house to ho use dragging two metal ingots and everybody wa s 
amazed  to see pots, pans,  tongs, and braziers tumb le down from their places and beams creak from 
the desperati on of nails and screws trying to emer ge, and even objects that had been lost for a long 
time appeared from where they had b een search ed for most and went drag ging along in turbulent 
confusion behind Melquíades’ magical irons. “Things have a life of their own,” the gypsy proclaimed  
with a harsh  accen t. “It’s simply a ma tter of wakin g up their souls.” José Arcadio Buend ía, w hose 
unbridled imagination always went beyond the ge nius of nature and even beyon d miracles a nd 
magic, thought that it wo uld be possible to make use  of that useless invention to extract gold from 
the bowels of the earth.  Melquíades, w ho was an honest man, warned hi m: “It won’t work f or 
that.” But José Arcadio B uendía at that time did no t believe in the hones ty of gypsies, so he traded  
his mule and  a pair of goats for the two magnetize d ingots. Úrsula Iguarán , his wife, who relied on 
those animal s to increase their poor domestic holdi ngs, was un able to dissuade him. “Very soon w ell 
have gold enough and more to pave the floors of the house,” her husband replied. For several 
months he worked hard to demonstr ate th e truth  of his idea. He explored every inch o f the region,  
even the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots al ong and reciting Melquíades’ incantation aloud.  
The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit of fifteenth-century armor which had all 
of its pieces soldered together with r ust and inside of which there was the hollow resonance of an  
enormous stone-filled go urd. When José Arcadio Bue ndía and the four men of his expedition 
managed to  take th e armor apart, they found in side a calci fied skeleton with a co pper locket 
containing a woman’s hai r around its neck. 
In March the gypsies returned. This time they br ought a telescope and a m agnifying glass the size 
of a drum, which they exhibited as the latest dis covery of the Jews of Amsterdam. They placed a  
gypsy woman at one end of the villa ge and set up the telescope at the entr ance to the tent. For the 
price of five reales, peop le could loo k into the telescope and s ee th e gypsy woman an arm’s length 
away. “Science has eliminated distance,” Melquíades  proclaimed. “In a short time, man will be able 
to see what is happenin g in any pla ce in th e world without leaving his own house.” A burning  
noonday sun brought out  a startling demonstration with  the gigantic magnifying glass: t hey put a pile 
of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun’s rays. José Arcadio 
Buendía, who had still not been consoled for the failu re of big magnets, conceived the idea of using 
that inventio n as a weapon of war. A gain Melquía des tried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted  
the two m agnetized ingo ts and three colonial coin s in exchange for the magnifying glass. Úrsula 
wept in cons ternation. T hat money was from a ch est of gold coins that her  father had p ut together  
ova an entir e life of privation and that s he had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper 
occasion to make use of it. José Arcadio Buendía  made no a t. tempt to console her, completely 
 8GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abn egation of a scientist and  even at the risk of his own 
life. In an attempt to sh ow the effects of the glass on enemy troops, he exposed himself to the 
concentra tion of the s un’s rays and  suffered burns wh ich turned into sores  that took a  long time to  
heal. Over the protests  of his wife, who was al arme d at such a dangerous inve ntion, at one point he 
was ready to set the ho use on fire. He would spend hours on end in his room, calculating th e 
strategic possibilities of his novel w eapon until he succeeded in putting together a manual of  
startling instructional clarity and an irresistible po wer of conviction. He sent  it to the government,  
accompani ed by numerous descriptions of his experiments  and several pages of explanatory  
sketches; by a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in mea sureless swamps, forded storm y 
rivers, and was on th e point of perishing under the la sh of despair, plague, an d wild beasts until he 
found a route that joined  the one us ed by the mul es that carried the mail. In spite of th e fact tha t a 
trip to th e capital was  little less th an impossible at th at tim e, José Arcadi o Buendía p romised to 
undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so t hat he could put on some practical  
demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities and could tr ain them himself in the 
complicated  art of solar war. For several years h e waited for a n answer. Fi nally, tired o f waiting, he 
bemoaned to Melquíades the failure of his project and the gypsy then gav e him a con vincing proof 
of his honesty: he gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and he left 
him i n addition some Portuguese maps and se veral instruments of navigation. In his own 
handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of th e studies by Monk Herm ann. which he left José 
Arcadio so that he would be able to make use of  the as trolabe, the co mpass, and the sextant. José  
Arcadio Buendía spent th e long months of the rainy season shut up in a small room that he had built 
in the rear of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments. Having completely aban-
doned his domestic obligations, he spent entire ni ghts i n the courtyard wa tching the course of the 
stars and he almost con tracted suns troke from trying  to establis h an exact method to  ascertain noon . 
When he became an expert in the use and manipula tion of his instruments, he conceived  a notion of 
space that al lowed him to navigate across unknown seas, to visit uninhabited territories, and to  
establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study. That was the period i n 
which he acquired the h abit of talking to himsel f, of walking through the house wi thout pa ying 
attention to anyone, as Úrsula and the children brok e their backs in the garden, growing banana an d 
caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and e ggplants. Suddenly, without warning,  his feverish 
activity was interrupted a nd was replaced by a kind of fascination. He spent several days as if he 
were bewitched, softly repeating to hi mself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his 
own understanding. Finally, one Tuesday in Decemb er, at lu nchtime, all  at once h e released the 
whole weight of his tor ment. The children would re member  for the rest of their lives the august 
solemnity with which their father, devastated b y his prolonged vigil a nd by the wrath of his  
imagination, revealed his discovery to them: 
“The earth is round, like a n orange.” 
Úrsula lost her patience. “If you have to go crazy,  please go crazy all by yo urself!” she shouted. 
“But don’t try to put your gypsy ideas into th e heads of the children.” José Arcadio Buendía, 
impassive, did not let himself be frightened by the de speration of his wife, who, in a s eizure of rage,  
mashed the astrolabe against the floo r. He built  another one, he gathered the men of the village in  
his little room, and he demonstrated to them, with theories that none of them could und erstand, the 
possibility of returning to  where one had set out by consistently sailing east. The whole village was 
convinced that José Arcadio Buendía had lost hi s reason, wh en Melquíades returned to set thing s 
straight. He gave public praise to the intelligen ce of a man who from pure  astronomical  speculation 
had evolved a theo ry that had already been proved  in practice, although unknown in Macondo until  
then, and as  a proof of his admiration he mad e him a gift that was to h ave a profound influence on 
the future of the village: the laboratory of an alchemist. 
 9GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
By then Melquíades had aged with surprising rapidi ty. On his first trips he seemed to b e the same 
age as José Arcadio Buendía. But while the latter had preserved his extraordinary strength, which 
permitted hi m to pull do wn a horse b y grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed  to have been worn dowse 
by some tenacious illness. It was, in reality, the re sult of multiple and rare di seases contracted on hi s 
innumerable trips around the world. According to wh at he himself said as he spoke to J osé Arcadio 
Buendía whi le helping him set up th e laboratory,  death follo wed him ev erywhere, sn iffing at the 
cuffs of his pants, but never deciding to give him th e final clutch of its cla ws. He was  a fugitive from 
all the plagues and catastrophes that  had ever las hed mankind. He had s urvived pellagra in Persia , 
scurvy in the Malayan archipelago, leprosy in Al exandria, beriberi in Ja pan, bubonic plague in 
Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a disast rous shipwreck in the Strait of Ma gellan. That 
prodigious creature, said to possess th e keys of No stradamus, was a gloomy man, enveloped in a sad 
aura, with an  Asiatic look  that seem ed to know wh at there was  on the o ther side of thin gs. He wore 
a large black hat th at loo ked like a ra ven with wid espread wings, and a velv et vest acros s which th e 
patina of th e centuries h ad skated. Bu t in spite of his immense wisdom and  his mysterious breadth, 
he had a hu man burden, an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily 
life. He would complain of the ailments of ol d age, he suffered from the most insignificant 
economic di fficulties, and he had stopped laughing a long tim e back because scurvy had made his  
teeth drop out. On that suffocating noontime when the gypsy revealed his secrets, José Arcadio 
Buendía had the certainty that it was the beginning  of a great friendship. The children were startled  
by his fantastic stories. Aureliano, who could not have been  more th an five at the time, woul d 
remember hi m for the rest of his life as he saw him that after noon, sitting against the metallic and 
quivering light from the window, lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest rea ches of th e 
imagination, while down over his temples there flo wed the grease that was b eing melted by the heat.  
José Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary memory to all of  
his descendants. Úrsula on the other hand, held a ba d memory of that visit, for she had entered the 
room just as Melquíades had carelessl y broken a flask of bichloride of mercury. 
“It’s the smell of the devil,” she said. 
“Not at all,” Melquíades corrected her. “It has b een proven that the devil has sulphuric properties  
and this is just a little corr osive sublimate.” 
Always did actic, he wen t into a  learn ed expositio n of the diabolical properties of cinnabar, but 
Úrsula paid no atten tion to him, altho ugh she took the children  off to pray. That biting odor would 
stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of Melquíades. 
The rudimentary laboratory—in addition to a prof usion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and 
sieves—was made up of a primitive water pipe, a gl ass beaker with a long, thin neck, a reproductio n 
of the philosopher’s egg, and a still the gypsies th emselves had built in accordance with modern 
descriptions of the three-armed alemb ic of Mary th e Jew. Along with those items, Melquíades left 
samples of the seven metals that cor responded to  the s even planets, the formulas of Moses and  
Zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold, and a s et of notes a nd sketches concerning the processes  
of the Grea t Teaching that would permit t hose who coul d interpret them to un dertake the 
manufacture of the philosopher’s stone. Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the 
quantity of gold, José Arcadio Buendía  paid court to Úrsula for several week s so that sh e would let 
him dig up her colonial coins and in crease th em by  as many times as it was possible to subdivide 
mercury. Úrsula gave in, as always, to her husb and’s unyielding obstinacy. Then José Arcadi o 
Buendía threw three doubloons into a  pan and fused them with copper filings, orpiment, brimstone, 
and lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil  until he got a thick  and pestilential syrup which 
was more like common caramel than valuable gold. In risky and desperate processes of distillation, 
melted with the seven pla netary m etals, mixed with  hermetic mercury and  vitriol of Cyprus, and put 
 10GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
back to coo k in hog fat for lack of any radish oil, Úrsula’s precious inheritance was reduced to  a 
large piece of burnt hog cracklings that wa s firmly stuck to the bottom of th e pot. 
When the gypsies came back, Úrsula h ad turned th e whole population of the village against them.  
But curiosity was  greater than fear, for that ti me th e gyp sies went a bout the to wn making a  
deafening noise with all manner of musical instru ments while a hawker a nnounced th e exhibition of 
the mos t fabulous discovery of the N aciancen es. So that ever yone went to the ten t and by p aying 
one cen t they saw a youthful Melquíades, recovere d, unwrinkled, with a  new and  flashing set of 
teeth. Thos e who rem embered his gums that had  been  destroyed by s curvy, his flaccid cheeks, and  
his withered lips trembled with fear at the fina l proof of the gypsy’s supernatural power. The fear 
turned into panic when Melquíades took out hi s teeth, intact, encased in their gums, and showed  
them to the audience for an instant—a fleeting in stant in which he wen t back to being the same 
decrepit man  of years past—and put them back again and smiled once more with the full control of 
his restored youth. Even José Arcadio Buendía hi mself considered that Melquíades’ knowledge had 
reached unb earable extremes, but he felt a healthy excitement when th e gypsy explained to him 
atone the workings of his false teeth.  It seem ed so simple and  so prodigious at th e same time that  
overnight he lost all interest in his experiment s in alchemy. He underwent a new cri sis of bad  
humor. He did not go back to ea ting regularly, and he would  spend the d ay walking through the 
house. “Incredible things are happening in the worl d,” he said to Úrsula. “Right there across the 
river there a re all kinds of magical instrument s while we keep on living like donkeys.” Those wh o 
had known him since the foundation of Macondo wer e startled at how mu ch he had ch anged under  
Melquíades’ influence. 
At first José Arcadio Buendía had been a kind of  youthful patriarch who would give  instructions  
for planting and advice f or the raising of children and animals,  and who col laborated with everyone, 
even in the p hysical work, for the welfare of the co mmunity. Since his hous e from the v ery first had  
been the best in the village, the other s had been bu ilt in its image and likeness. It had a small, well-
lighted living roost, a dining room in the shap e of a terrace with  gaily colored flowers, two  
bedrooms, a courtyard with a gigantic chestnut tr ee, a well kep t garden, and a corral where goats,  
pigs, and hens lived in peaceful communion. The only animals that were prohibited, not just in his  
house but in the entire settlement, were fighting cocks. 
Úrsula’s capacity for work was th e sam e as th at of her husband. Active, sm all, severe, that woma n 
of unbreakable nerves who at no moment in he r life had been heard to sing seemed to b e 
everywhere, from dawn until quite la te at night, always pursued by th e soft  whispering of her stiff, 
starched petticoats. Tha nks to her the floors of  tamped earth, the unwhi tewashed  mud walls, the 
rustic, wooden furniture they had built them selves were always  dean, and the old chests where they  
kept their cl othes exhaled the warm s mell of basil. 
José Arcadio Buendía, who was the most enterpr ising man ever to be seen in the village, had set 
up the placement of the houses in such a way th at from all of them one could reach the river and 
draw water with the sam e effort, and he had lined up the streets with such good sense th at no house 
got more su n than another during the hot time of  day. With in a few years Macondo was a village 
that was more orderly and  hard working than any k nown until then by its three hundred inhabitants.  
It was a truly happy village where no one was over  thirty years of age and where no one had died. 
Since the time of its founding, José Arcadio Buendía  had built traps and cages. In a short time h e 
filled not only his own house but all of those in the village with troupials, canaries, bee eaters, and 
redbreasts. The concert o f so many different birds became so di sturbing that Úrsula would plug her 
ears with b eeswax so as  not to los e her sense of re ality. The first time that Melquíades’ tribe arrived, 
selling glass balls for headaches, ever yone was sur prised that they had been able to find that village 
lost in the drowsiness of the swamp,  and the gypsi es confessed  that they ha d found thei r way b y the 
song of the birds. 
 11GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
That spirit of social initiative disappeared i n a short time, pulled away by the fever of the 
magnets, the astronomical calculations, the dreams  of transmutation, and the urge to discover the 
wonders of the world. From a clean and active ma n, José Arcadio Buendía changed into a man lazy 
in appearance, careless in his dress, with a wild be ard that Úrsula managed to trim with great effort 
and a kitchen knife. There were many who consider ed him the victim of some strange spell. But 
even those most convin ced of his madness left wo rk and family to follow him when he brought out 
his tools to clear the land and asked the assemble d group to open a way that would put Macondo in 
contact with the great inventions. 
José Arcadio  Buendía wa s completel y ignorant of th e geography of the regi on. He knew that to  
the east th ere lay an imp enetrable mo untain chain  and tha t on the other side of the mountains ther e 
was th e ardent city of Ri ohacha, wh ere in times  past—accordi ng to wha t he had  been  told by th e 
first Aurelia no Buendía, his grandfa ther—Sir Francis Drake had gone crocodile hunting with 
cannons and  that he repaired hem and stuffed them with straw to bring to Queen Eli zabeth. In hi s 
youth, José Arcadio Buendía and hi s men, with  wives and children, an imals and all kinds of domestic 
implements,  had crossed the moun tains in sear ch of an ou tlet to the s ea, and after twenty-six 
months they gave up the expedition and founded Ma condo, so they would not have to go back. It 
was, therefore, a route that did not interest him, for it could lead only to th e past. To the south lay 
the swamps,  covered with an eterna l vegetable sc um and th e whole vast universe of the great 
swamp, whi ch, accordin g to wha t the gypsies s aid, had no  limits. The great swamp  in the wes t 
mingled with a boundless extension of water where there were soft-skinned ceta ceans  that had the 
head and tor so of a woman, causing the ruination of sailors with the ch arm of their extraordinar y 
breasts. The gypsies sailed along that route for six m onths before they reached the strip of land over  
which the m ules that carried the mail passed. Acco rding to José Arcadio Buendía’s calculations, the 
only p ossibility of contact with civilization lay alon g the northern route. So he handed out clearing  
tools and h unting weap ons to th e same men  who had b een with him  during the founding of 
Macondo. He threw his d irectional instruments an d his maps i nto a knapsa ck, and he u ndertook th e 
reckless adventure. 
During the first days they did not co me across any appreciab le obstacle. They went d own alon g 
the stony ba nk of the river to the pla ce where yea rs before they had found the soldier’s armor, and  
from there they went in to the woods  along a path b etween wild orange trees. At the en d of the first 
week th ey kil led and roasted a d eer, bu t they agreed  to eat only h alf of it and s alt the rest f or the da ys 
that lay ahead. With that precaution they tried to  postpone th e necessity o f having to eat macaws , 
whose blue flesh had a h arsh and musky taste. Th en, for more than ten d ays, they did not see th e 
sun again. The ground became soft a nd damp, like volcanic as h, and the vegetation wa s thicker and  
thicker, and the cries of the birds and  the uproar  of the monk eys became more and m ore remote,  
and the world became eternally sad. The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their mos t 
ancient m emories in that paradise of dampness and  silence, going back to before original sin, as their 
boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes des troyed bloody lilies and golden salaman-
ders. For a week, almost without speaking, they went ahead l ike sleepwalkers through a universe of 
grief, lighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects , and their lu ngs were ov erwhelmed 
by a suffocating smell of blood. They could not r eturn because the strip th at they were opening as 
they went along would soon close u p with a new ve getation that. almos t seemed to grow before 
their eyes. “ It’s all right,” José Arca dio Buendía wo uld say. “The main thing is not to lose our  
bearings.” Always following his compass, he kept  on guiding his men to ward the invisible north so  
that they wo uld be able to get out of that ench anted region. It was a thick  night, starless, but the 
darkness was becom ing impregnated with a fresh and clear air. Exhausted by the long crossing, they 
hung up their hammocks and slept deeply for the first time in two weeks. When they woke up, with  
the sun alrea dy high in the sky, they were speechl ess with fascination. Before them, surrounded by 
 12GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
ferns and palm trees, white and powdery in the silent morning light, was an enor mous Spanish 
galleon. Tilted slightly to the starboar d, it had hang ing from its intact masts  the dirty rags of its sails 
in the midst of its rigging, which wa s adorned with  orchids. The hull, co vered with a n armor of 
petrified barnacles a nd soft moss, was firmly fastened into a  surface of stones. The wh ole structure 
seemed to o ccupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and 
the habits o f the birds. Inside, where the expedi tionaries explored with careful intent, there was 
nothing but a thick forest of flowers. 
The discovery of the galleon, an indication of the proximity of the se a, broke José Arcadio 
Buendía’s drive. He considered it a trick of his whimsical fate to have searched for the sea withou t 
finding it, at the cost of countless sacrifices an d suffering, and to have found it all of a sudden  
without look ing for it, as if it lay acr oss his pa th like an insurmountable object. Man y years la ter 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía crossed t he region again, when it was already a regular mail route, and  
the only part of the ship he found was its burned-o ut frame in the midst of a field of poppies. Only 
then, convin ced tha t the story had no t been som e product of his father’s imagination, did he wonder 
how the gall eon had been able to get inland to th at spot. But José Arcadio Buendía did not concern 
himself with that when he found th e sea after another four days’ journey from the galleon. His 
dreams ended as he faced  that ashen, f oamy, dirty sea, which h ad not merited the risks a nd sacrifices 
of the adven ture. 
“God damn i t!” he shouted. “Macondo is surrounded by water on all sides.” 
The idea of a peninsular Macondo prevailed for a long time, i nspired by the arbitrary map tha t 
José Arcadio Buendía sketched on his return from  the expedition. He drew it in rage, evilly, 
exaggerating the difficulties of comm unication, as  if to punish himself for the absolute l ack of sense 
with which he had chosen the place.  “We’ll never get anywhere,” he lamented to Úrsula. “We’re 
going to rot our lives away here without receiving  the benefits of science.” That certainty, mulled  
over for several months in the small room he used as his laboratory, brough t him to th e conception  
of the plan to move Maeondo to a b etter place. But that tim e Úrsula had anticipated his feverish 
designs. With the s ecret and implacable labor o f a small an t she predis posed the women of the  
village again st the flightiness of their husbands , who were already prepar ing for the move. José 
Arcadio Buendía did not  know at what moment or  because of what adverse forces his plan had 
become enveloped in a web of prete xts, disappointments, and  evasions until it turned i nto nothing  
but an illusion. Úrsula watched him with innocent attention an d even felt some pity for him on the 
morning when she found him in the back room muttering about his plans for moving as he placed  
his laboratory pieces in th eir original boxes. She l et him finish. She let him n ail up the boxes and put 
his initials on them with an inked brush, withou t reproaching him, but knowing now t hat he knew 
(because she had heard him say so in his so ft monologues) that the men of the village would not 
back him up in his undertaking. Only when he be gan to take down the door of the room did Úrsul a 
dare ask him  what h e was doing, and he answered  with a certai n bitterness. “Since no one wants  to 
leave, we’ll leave all by ourselves.” Úrsula did not become upset. 
“We will not leave,” she said. “We will stay  here, because we have had a son here.” 
“We have still not had a death,” he  said. “A person does not bel ong to a place until there is 
someone dead under the ground.” 
Úrsula replie d with a soft firmness: 
“If I have to die for the rest of you to stay here, I wi ll die.” 
José Arcadio Buendía had not thought that his wi fe’s will w as so firm. He tried to seduce her  
with the cha rm of his fantasy, with the promise of a prodigious world where all one had to do was  
sprinkle some magic liqui d on th e ground and th e plants would  bear fruit whenever a  man wished,  
and where all manner of instruments against pain  were sold at bargain prices. But Úrsula was 
insensible to his clairvoyance. 
 13GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“Instead of going around thinking about your cr azy inventions, you should be worrying abou t 
your sons,” she replied. “Look at the s tate they’re i n, running wild just like donkeys.” 
José Arcadio Buendía took his wife’s words li terally. He looked out the window and  saw the 
barefoot children in the s unny garden and he had  the impressi on that onl y at tha t insta nt had th ey 
begun to exist, conceived by Úrsula’s spell, So mething occurred inside of him then, something  
mysterious a nd definitive that uprooted him from his own time and carried him adrift through an 
unexplored region of his memory. While Úrsula c ontinued sweeping the hou se, which was safe now 
from being abandoned for the rest of her life, he stood there with an absor bed look, co ntemplating  
the children  until his eyes becam e moist and h e dried them  with th e back of his han d, exhaling a 
deep sigh of resignation. 
“All right,” he said. “Tell them to com e help me tak e the things out of the bo xes.” 
José Arcadio , the older o f the children, was fourteen. He had  a square head, thick hai r, and his 
father’s character. Althou gh he had the same impu lse for growth and physical strength, it was early 
evident that he lacked imagination. He had been conceived and born during th e difficult crossing of  
the mountai ns, before the founding of Macondo, and his parents gave tha nks to heaven when th ey 
saw he had no animal features. Aureliano, the firs t human being to be born in Macondo, would be 
six years old in March. He was silen t and withdr awn. He h ad wept in his mother’s wo mb and ha d 
been born with his eyes open. As they were cutting the umbilical cord, he m oved his head from side  
to side, taki ng in the th ings in the room and ex amining the faces of th e people with a fearless 
curiosity. Then, indifferent to  thos e who cam e close to l ook at him,  he kept his atten tion 
concentra ted on the palm  roof, which looked as if it were abo ut to collaps e under the tremendous 
pressure of t he rain. Úrsula did not remember the intensity of that look a gain until on e day when 
little Aurelia no, at th e age of three, went into  the kitchen  at the mom ent she was tak ing a pot o f 
boiling soup  from the stove and putting it on the tabl e. The child, Perplexed, said from the doorway, 
“It’s going to spill.” The pot was firm ly placed in the center of the tabl e, but just as soon as the chil d 
made his announcement, it began an unmistakable  movement toward the edge, as if impelled by 
some inner dynamism, and it fell and broke on the floor. Úrsula, alarmed, told her husband about 
the episode, but he interpreted it as  a natural phe nomenon. Th at was  the way he always  was alien to  
the existence of his sons, partly becaus e he consid ered childhood as a period of mental insufficiency, 
and partly because he was  always too a bsorbed in his fantastic speculations. 
But since the afternoon when he called the child ren in to help him unpack the things in the 
laboratory, he gave them his best hou rs. In the sm all separate room, where the walls were gradually 
being covered by strange maps and fabulous drawin gs, he taught them to read and write and do 
sums, and he spoke to them about the wonders of the world, not only where his learning had 
extended, but forcing the limits of his imagination to extrem es. It was  in that wa y that th e boys  
ended up learning that in the southern extremes of Africa there were men so  intelligent a nd peaceful 
that their onl y pastim e was to sit and think, and tha t it was possi ble to cross the Aegean S ea on foot 
by jumping from island to island all the way to  the port of Salonika. Those hallucinati ng sessions 
remained printed on th e mem ories of the boys in suc h a wa y that man y years later, a second befor e 
the regular army officer gave the firing squad th e command to fire, Colon el Aureliano Buendía saw  
once more that warm March afternoon on which his father had interrupted the lesson in physics and  
stood fascinated, with his hand in the air and his eyes motionless, listening to the distant pipes,  
drums, and jingles of the gypsies, who were comi ng to the village once more, announci ng the latest 
and most startling discovery of the sages of Memphis. 
They were n ew gypsies, young men and women  who knew only their own language, handsome 
specimens with oily skins and intelligent hand s, whose dances and music sowed a panic of  
uproarious joy through the streets, with parrots pain ted all colors reciting Italian arias, and a hen 
who laid a hundred golden eggs to the sound of a tambourine, and a tr ained monk ey who read  
 14GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
minds, and the multi-use machine tha t could be used at the s ame time to s ew on butto ns and reduce 
fevers, and the apparatus  to make a person forget his bad memories, and a poultice to lose time, and 
a thousand  more inventi ons so ingenious and unu sual that José Arcadio  Buendía must have wan ted 
to invent a memo ry machine so th at he could rememb er them all. In an inst ant they transfo rmed the 
village. The inhabitants of Macondo found themselv es lost is their own streets, confused by the 
crowded fair. 
Holding a child by each hand so as n ot to lose th em in the tu mult, bumping into acrobats with  
gold-capped teeth and jugglers with six arms, suffo cated by the mingled breath of manure an d 
sandals that the crowd exhaled, José Arcadi o Buendía went about everywhere like a madman,  
looking for Melquíades so that h e could reveal to him the infinite secrets  of that fabulou s nightmare. 
He asked several gypsies, who did not understand  his language. Finally he reached th e place where 
Melquíades used to set u p his tent an d he found a taciturn Ar menian who in Spanish was hawking a 
syrup to make oneself invisible. He had drunk do wn a glass of the amber substance in  one gulp as 
José Arcadio Buendía elbowed his  way throu gh the absorbed group that was witnessing th e 
spectacl e, and was able to ask his question. The gy psy wrapped him in the frightful climate of his  
look before he turned into a puddle of pestilent ial and smoking pitch over which the echo of his 
reply still floated: “Melquíades is dead. ” Upset by the news,  José Arcadio Buendía stood motionless,  
trying to rise above his a ffliction, until the group dispersed, called away by other artifices, and th e 
puddle of the taciturn Armenian evaporated co mpletely. Other gypsies confirmed later on that 
Melquíades had in fact succumbed to the fever on the beach at Singapore and that his body had 
been thrown  into the deepest part of the Java Se a. The children had no interest in the news. They 
insisted that their father take them to see the overwhelming novelty of the sages of Memphis tha t 
was being advertised at the entrance of a tent that, according to what was said, had belonged to King 
Solomon. They insisted so much that José Arcadio Buendía paid the thirty reales and led them into  
the center of  the tent, wh ere there wa s a giant with  a hairy tor so and a sh aved head, wi th a cop per 
ring in his nose and a heavy iron chain on his a nkle, watching over a pirate chest. When it was 
opened by the giant, the chest gave off a glacia l exhalation. Inside there was only an  enormous, 
transparent block with i nfinite internal needles in  which th e light of the su nset was  broken up into  
colored stars. Disconcerted, knowing that th e chi ldren were waiting for an immediate explanation, 
José Arcadio Buendía ventured a murmur: 
“It’s the largest diamond in the world.” 
“No,” the gypsy countered. “It’s ice.” 
José Arcadio  Buendía, wi thout unders tanding, st retched ou t his hand towa rd the cake, but th e 
giant moved  it away. “Five reales mo re to tou ch it,” he said. José Arcadio Buendía pai d them and  
put his hand on the ice and held it there for se veral minutes as his heart filled with fear and 
jubilation at the contact with mys tery. Without knowing what to say, he pai d ten reales more so that  
his sons coul d have that p rodigious experience. Litt le José Arcadio refused to touch it. Aureliano, on 
the other hand, took a step forward and put his hand on it, withdrawing it immediately. “It’s 
boiling,” he exclaimed, startled. But his father paid  no attention to him. Intoxicated by the evidence 
of the miracle, he forgot  at that moment abou t the frustration of his de lirious undertakings and 
Melquíades’ body, abandoned to the appetite of the squids. He paid another five reales and with his 
hand on the cake, as if giving testimony  on the ho ly scriptures, he exclaimed : 
“This is the great invention of our time.”

Chapter 2 
WHE N THE PIRATE  Sir Francis Drake attacked Riohacha in the sixteenth  century, Úrsula Iguarán’s 
great-great-grandmother became so  frightened with the ringing of alarm bells and the firing of 
cannons that she lost control of her nerves and sa t down on a l ighted stove. The burns changed her  
into a useless wife for the rest of her days. She could only sit on one side,  cushioned by pillows, and 
something strange must have happened to her way of  walking, for she never walked again in public.  
She gave up all kinds of social activity, obsesse d with the notion that her body gave off a singed 
odor. Dawn would find her in the courtyard, for she did not  dare fall asleep  lest she dream of the 
English and their ferocious attack d ogs as they came through the windo ws of her bedroom to  
submit her to shameful tortures with their red-hot  irons. Her husband, an Aragonese merchant by  
whom she h ad two child ren, spent h alf the value of his store on medicin es and pasti mes in an 
attemp t to alleviate her terror. Finally he sold th e business and  took the family to live far from the 
sea in a settl ement of peaceful Indians located  in the foothills , where he built his wife a bedroom 
without win dows so that the pirates o f her dream would have no way to get in. 
In that hidden village  there was a native-born t obacco planter who had lived there for so me time, 
Don José Arcadio Buendía, with whom Úrsula’s gr eat-great-grandfather established a partnership 
that was so lucrative that within a few years they  made a fortune. Several centuries later the great-
great-grandson of the native-born planter married the great-great-granddaughter of the Aragonese.  
Therefore, every time th at Úrsul a became exercis ed over her husband’s mad ideas, she would leap  
back over three hundred years of fate and curs e the day that Sir Francis Drake had atta cked 
Riohacha. It was simply a wa y. of giving herself some relief, because actually they were joined till 
death by a bond that was  more solid that love : a common prick of conscience. They were cousins.  
They had grown up together in the old village that both of their ancestors, wi th their work and their 
good habits, had transformed into one of the finest towns  in the province. Although th eir marriage 
was predicted from the time they had  come into th e world, when they exp ressed their desire to be 
married their own relatives tried to sto p it. They we re afraid that those two healthy prod ucts of two  
races that ha d interbred over the cen turies would suffer the shame of breeding iguanas. There had 
already been a horrible preceden t. An  aunt of Úrsula’s, married to an un cle of José Arcadi o Buendía,  
had a son who went thr ough life wearing loose, baggy  trousers and who  bled to d eath after havin g 
lived forty-two years in the purest sta te of virginity, for he had been born and had grown up with a 
cartilaginous tail in the shape of a corkscrew and with a small tuft of hair on the tip. A pig’s tail that 
was never allowed to be seen by any woman and that cost him his life when a butcher friend did him 
the favor of chopping it off with his cleaver. José  Arcadio Buendía, with th e whimsy of his nineteen  
years, resolved the problem with a single phrase: “I don’t care if I have piglets as long as they can  
talk.” So they were m arried amidst a  festival of fireworks and a brass ban d that went on for three 
days. They would have been happy from then on if  Úrsula’s mother had not terrified her with all 
manner of si nister predictions about their offspring, even to th e extrem e of advising her to refuse to 
consummate the marriage. Fearing that her stout and willful husband would rape her while she slept,  
Úrsula, before going to bed, would put on a rudimentary kind of drawers that her moth er had mad e 
out of sailclo th and had r einforced with a sys tem of crisscrossed leather  straps  and th at was closed  in 
the front by a thick iron buckle. That was how th ey lived for several months. During the day h e 
would take care of his fighting cocks and she would do frame embroidery with her moth er. At night 
they would wrestle for several hours in an anguished violence that s eemed to be a subs titute for the  
act of love, until popular intuition got a whiff of  something irregular and the rumor  spread that 
 16GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Úrsula was s till a virgin a  year after her marriage because her husband was impotent. José Arcadio 
Buendía was the last one to hear the ru mor. 
“Look at what people are going around saying , Úrsula,” he told his wife very calmly. 
“Let them ta lk,” she said. “We know that it’s not tr ue.” 
So the situation went on the same way for another six months until that tragic Sunday when José 
Arcadio Buendía won a cockfight from Prudencio Agu ilar. Furious, aroused by the blood of his bird,  
the loser backed away from José Arcadio Buendía so  that everyone in the cockpit could hear what 
he was going to tell him. 
“Congratulations!” he shouted. “Maybe that rooster of yours can do your wife a favor.” 
José Arcadio Buendía ser enely picked up his rooste r. “I’ll be right back,” he told everyone. And  
then to Prudencio Aguilar: 
“You go ho me and get a weapon, because I’m going to kill you .” 
Ten minutes  later he returned with the notched sp ear that had belonged to his grandfather. At 
the door to  the cockpit, where half the town  had gathered, Prudencio Agu ilar was waiti ng for him. 
There was no time to defend himself. José Arcadio Buendía’s spear, thrown with the strength of a 
bull and with the same good aim with which th e first Aureliano Buendía had exter minated the 
jaguars in the region, pierced his throat. That ni ght, as they held a wake over the co rpse in the 
cockpit, José Arcadio Bu endía went into the b edroom as his wife was putting on her chastity pan ts. 
Pointing the spear at her he ordered: “Take th em off.” Úrsula  had no doubt about her husband’s 
decision. “You’ll be responsible for what happen s,” she murmured. José Arcadio Buendía stuck the 
spear into th e dirt floor. 
“If you bear iguanas, we’ ll raise iguanas,” he said. “But there’ll be no more killings in this town 
because of you.” 
It was a fine June night, cool and with a moon,  and they were awake and f rolicking in bed until 
dawn, indifferent to the breeze tha t passed through the bedroom, loaded with the weeping of 
Prudencio Aguilar’s kin. 
The matter was put down a s a duel of honor, but both of them were left with a twinge in their 
conscience. One night, when she co uld not sleep,  Úrsula went out into  the courtyard  to get so me 
water and  she saw Prudencio Aguilar by th e water jar. He wa s livid, a sad expression on his face,  
trying to cover the hole i n his throat with a plug made of esparto grass. It did not bring on fear in 
her, but pity. She went back to the room and told her husband what she had seen, but he did not 
think much of it. “This just means th at we can’ t stand the wei ght of our conscience.” Two nights 
later Úrsula saw Prudencio Aguilar again, in the bathroom, using the esparto plug to wash the 
clotted blood from his throat. On another night she saw hi m strolling in the rain. José Arcadio 
Buendía, annoyed by hi s wife’s hallucinations, went out into the courtyard armed with the spear . 
There was th e dead man with his sad expression. 
“You go to hell,” José Arcadio Buendía shouted at  him. “Just as many times as you come back, 
I’ll kill you again.” 
Prudencio Aguilar did not go away, nor did José Arcadio Buendía dare throw the spear. He never  
slept well after that. He was tormented by the immense des olation with which the d ead man ha d 
looked at hi m through the rain, his deep nostalg ia as he year ned for living people, the anxiety with 
which he sea rched through the house looking for some water with which to  soak his esparto plug. 
“He must be suffering a great deal,” he said to Úr sula. “You can see that he’s so very lonely.” She 
was so moved that the next time sh e saw the d ead man un covering the pots on th e stove sh e 
understood what he was  looking for, and from then on she placed water  jugs all about the house. 
One night when he found him washing his wound in his own room, José Anedio Buendía could no 
longer resist. 
 17GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“It’s all right, Prudencio,” he told hi m. “We’re going to leave this town, j ust as far away as we 
can go, and we’ll never come back. G o in peace n ow.” 
That was  how they undertook the cr ossing of th e mountains.  Several friends of José Arcadio 
Buendía, young men like him, excited, by the a dventure, dismantled their houses and packed up , 
along with their wives an d children, to head towar d the l and that no one had promised them. Before 
he left, José Arcadio Buendía buried the spear in the courtyard  and, one after the other,  he cut the 
throats of his magnificent fighting cocks, trusting that in that way he coul d give some measure of 
peace to Prudencio Aguilar. All that Úrsula took along were a  trunk with her bridal clothes, a few 
household u tensils, and the small ch est with  the gold pieces th at she had in herited from her father.  
They did not lay out any definite itinerary. They simp ly tried to go in a direction opposite to the road  
to Riohacha  so that they would not leave any tra ce or meet an y people they knew. It was  an absurd 
journey. After fourteen months, her stomach co rrupted by monkey mea t and snake stew, Úrsula 
gave birth to a son who had all of  his features  human. Sh e had travel ed half of the trip in a 
hammock that two men carried on their shoulders , because swelling had disfigu red her legs and her  
varicose veins had puffed up like bubbles. Although it was pitiful to see them with their sunken 
stomachs an d languid eyes, the children survived the journey better than th eir parents, and most of 
the time i t was fun for them. One mo rning, after almost two years of crossing, they beca me the firs t 
mortals to see the western slopes of the mounta in range. From the cloudy summit they saw the 
immense aqu atic expans e of the great s wamp as  it spread out to ward the o ther side of the world. But 
they never found the sea . One night, after several months of lost wandering through the swamps, far 
away no w from the last Indians they had met on  their way, they ca mped on the bank s of a stony 
river whose waters were like a torrent of frozen  glass. Years later, during the secon d civil war, 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía tried to follow that same route in order to take R iohacha by s urprise and 
after six days of traveling he understood that it  was madness. Nevertheless , the night on which they 
camped b eside the river, his father’s host had th e look of shipwrecked people with no  escape,  but 
their number had grown during the crossing and they were all prepared (an d they succeeded) to di e 
of old age. José Arcadio Buendía dreamed that nigh t that right there a noisy city with ho uses having  
mirror wails rose up. He asked wha t city it was and they ans wered him with a name that he had 
never heard, that had  no meaning at  all, but that h ad a superna tural echo in his dream: Macondo. On 
the following day he con vinced his m en that they wo uld never find the sea. He ordered them to cut 
down the trees to make a  clearing beside the rive r, at the coolest spot on the bank, and there they 
founded the village. 
José Arcadio  Buendía did not succeed  in decipheri ng the drea m of houses with mirror walls until 
the da y he discovered ice.  Then he th ought he un derstood its deep meanin g. He thought tha t in th e 
near future they would  be able to ma nufacture blocks of ice on a large s cale from such a common 
material as water and with  them build the new house s of the village. Macondo would no longer be a 
burning place, where th e hinges and door knockers twisted with  the heat, bu t would be changed into 
a wintry city.  If he did n ot persevere in his attem pts to build an ice factor y, it was  because at tha t 
time he was absolutely en thusiastic over the educati on of his sons, especially that of Aureliano, who 
from the first had revealed a strange intuition fo r alchemy. The laboratory had been dusted off. 
Reviewing Melquíades’ notes, seren e now, with out the exaltation of no velty, i n prolonged and  
patient sessi ons they tried to separa te Úrsula’s gold from the debris that wa s stuck t o the bottom of  
the pot. You ng José Arcadio scarcely t ook part in the process. While his father was involved body 
and soul with his water pipe, the willful first-born, who had always  been too big for his age, had 
become a m onumental a dolescent. H is voice had ch anged. An incipient fuzz appeared on his upper 
lip. One night, as Úrsula went into the room where he was  undressing to go to bed, she felt a  
mingled sense of shame a nd pity: he was the first man th at sh e had seen n aked after h er husband, 
 18GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
and he was so well-equipped for life t hat he seem ed abnormal. Úrsula, pre gnant for the third time, 
relived her newlywed terror. 
Around that time a merry, foul-mouthed, provocat ive woman ca me to the ho use to help with th e 
chorea, and she knew h ow to read the future in cards. Úrsula spoke t o her about her son. She 
thought that his disproportionate s ize was something as unnatural a s her cousin’s tail of a pig. 
The woman  let out an expansive laugh that resounded through the house like a spray of broken  
glass. “Just the opposite,” she said. “He’ll be very  lucky.” In order to confirm her pre diction she 
brought her cards to the house a few days later and locked herself up with José Arcadio in a granary 
off the kitch en. She calm ly placed her  cards on an  old carpenter’s bench. s aying anythi ng that came 
into her head, while the boy waited beside her, mo re bored than intrigued. Suddenly she reached out 
her hand and touched hi m. “Lordy!” she said, sincerel y startled, and that was all she could say. José 
Arcadio felt his bones filling up with foam, a languid fear, and a  terrible desire to weep. The woman  
made no insi nuations. But José Arcadio kept lookin g for her all night long, for the smell  of smoke 
that she had under her armpits and that had got caug ht under his skin. He wanted to be with her all 
the time, he wanted h er to be his mo ther, for them never to l eave the gra nary, and for her t o say 
“Lordy!” t o him. One day he could not stand it a ny more and. he went looking for her at her house:  
He made a f ormal visit, sitting uncomprehendingl y in t he living room without sayi ng a word. At 
that moment he had no d esire for her. He found he r different, entirely foreign to the im age that h er 
smell brought on, as if she were someone else. He drank his coffee and left the house in depression.  
That night, d uring the frightful time of  lying awake,  he d esired h er again with  a brutal  anxiety, but h e 
did not want her that time as she had been in the g ranary but as  she had been that afternoon. 
Days later th e woman  suddenly called  him t o her house, wher e she was al one with h er mother,  
and she had  him come into t he bedroom with the pretext o f showing him a deck of cards. Then 
she touched him with such freedom that he suffered a delusion after the initial shudder, and he felt 
more fear th an pleasure. She asked him to com e and see her that night. He agreed. in order t o get 
away, knowi ng that he was incapable of going. But  that night, in his burning bed, he understood tha t 
he had to go  we her, even if he were not capable. He got dressed by feel, listening in the dark t o his 
brother’s calm breathing, the dry cough of his father  in the next room, the asthma of the hens in the 
courtyard, the buzz of the mosquitoes, the beating of his heart, and the inordinate bustle of a world 
that he had not noticed  until then, a nd he went ou t into th e sleeping street. With all his heart he  
wanted th e door to be barred and not just closed  as she had promised him. But it was open. He 
pushed it with the tips of his fingers and the hinges  yielded with a mournful and articulate moan th at 
left a frozen echo inside of him. From the moment  he en tered, sideways and trying not to make a  
noise, he caught the smell. He was still in the ha llway, where the woman’s three brothers had their  
hammocks i n positions that he could not see and th at he coul d not determine in the darkness as he 
felt his way along the hall to push open the bedr oom door and get his bearings there so as not to  
mistake the bed. He found it. He bumped agai nst the ropes of the hammocks, which were lower 
than he h ad suspected, and a man who had been  snoring until then turned  in his sleep and said in a 
kind of delusion, “It was Wednesday.” When he pushed open the bedroom door, he could not 
prevent it from scraping against the uneven floor. Suddenly, in the absolute darkness, he understood  
with a hopel ess nostal gia that he was completely disoriented. Sleeping in the narrow roo m were the 
mother, another daughter with her hu sband and two children, and the wo man, who m ay not h ave 
been there. He could have guided himself by the smell if the smell had not been all over the house, 
so devious and at the sa me time so d efinite, as it had always b een on his skin. He did not move for a 
long time, wondering in fright how he had ever got to that abys s of abandonment, when a hand with 
all its fingers extended and feeling about in the da rkness touched his face. He was not surprised, for 
without knowing, he had been expecting it. Then he gave himself over to that hand, and in a terrible 
state of exhaustion he let himself be led to a shap eless place wh ere his cloth es were taken off and he 
 19GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
was heaved about like a sack of potatoes and thr own from one side to the other in a bottomless  
darkness in which his arms were useless, where it no longer smelled of woman but of ammonia, and 
where he tried to rememb er her face and found befo re him the face of Úrsula, confusedly aware tha t 
he was  doing something that for a v ery long tim e he h ad wa nted to  do b ut that he h ad imagined 
could really never be done, not kn owing what h e was doing because he did not know where his feet  
were or where his head was, or w hose feet or wh ose head, an d feeling that he could n o longer resist 
the glacial ru mbling of his kidneys and the air of his intestines, and fear, and the bewildered anxiety 
to flee and at the same time stay forever in th at exasperated sil ence and tha t fearful solitude. 
Her name was Pilar Ternera. She had  been part of the exodus that end ed with the fou nding of 
Macondo, dragged along by her family in order to  separate her from  the man who had raped her at 
fourteen and had continued to love her until she was twen ty-two, but who never made up his mind 
to make the situation public because he was a ma n apart. He promised to follow her to the ends of 
the earth, but only later on, when he put his affairs in order, and she had become tired of waiting for 
him, always identifying him with the tall and shor t, blond and brunet men that her card s promised 
from land and sea within three days, three months , or three years. With her waiting she had lost the 
strength of her thighs, the firmness of her breasts,  her habit of tenderness, but she kept the madness 
of her heart intact.  Mad dened by that prodigious plaything, José Arcadio  followed her path ev ery 
night through the labyrinth of the room. On a cert ain occasion he found the door barred, and he 
knocked several times, knowing that if he had th e boldness to knock the first time he would have 
had to kno ck until the la st, and after  an intermi nable wait she opened th e door for him. During the 
day, lying down to dream , he would s ecretly enjo y the memories of the night before. But when sh e 
came into  the house, m erry, indifferent, chatty, he did not have to mak e any effort to hide his 
tension, because that woman, whos e explosive laugh frightened off the doves, had nothing to do 
with the invisible power that taught him how to br eathe from within and control his heartbeats, and 
that had per mitted him to understan d why man ar e afraid of death. He was so wrap ped up in 
himself that he did not even understa nd the joy of  everyone when his father and his brother aroused 
the household with the n ews that they had succeed ed in penetrating the metallic debris and had  
separated Úrsula’s gold. 
They had su cceeded, as a matter of fact, after putting in complicated and p ersevering days at it.  
Úrsula was happy, and sh e even gave thanks to G od for the invention of alchemy, while the people 
of the village  crushed into the laboratory, and they served them guava jelly on crackers to celebrate 
the wonder, and José Arcadio Buendía let them see the crucible with the reco vered gold, as if he had  
just invented it. Showing it all around, he ended up  in front of his older son, who during the past 
few days ha d barely put in an appea rance in the laboratory. He put the dry and yellowish mass in 
front of his e yes and asked him: “What does it l ook like to you?” José Arca dio answered sincerely: 
“Dog shit.” 
His father gave him a blow with the back of hi s hand that brought out blood and tears. That 
night Pilar T ernera put arnica compresses on the s welling, feeling about for the bottle and cotton in 
the dark, and she did everything she wanted with  him as long as it did not bother him, making a n 
effort to love him witho ut hurting him. They re ached such a  state of inti macy that la ter, withou t 
realizing it, they were whispering to each other. 
“I want to b e alone with  you,” he said. “One of these days I’ m going to tell everybody and we 
can stop all of this sneaking around.” 
She did not try to calm hi m down. 
“That would be fine,” she said “If w e’re alone, we’ll leave the lamp lighted so that we can see 
each oth er, and I can h oller as much as I want without anybody’s having to butt in, and you ca n 
whisper in my ear any cra p you can thi nk of.” 
 20GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
That convers ation, the biting rancor that he felt  against his father, and the imminent possibility of 
wild love inspired a serene courage in him. In a spontaneous way, without any preparati on, he told  
everything to his brother. 
At first you ng Aureliano understoo d only th e risk, the imm ense possibility of danger that his  
brother’s adventures implied, and he could not un derstand the fascination of the subject. Little by 
little he beca me contami nated with  the anxiety. He  wondered about the details of th e dangers, he 
identified himself with the suffering and enjoyment of his brother, he felt frightened and happy. He  
would stay a wake waiting  for him until dawn in the solitary bed that seemed to have a bottom of live  
coals, and th ey would keep on talking until it was ti me to get up , so that bo th of them so on suffered 
from the same drowsiness, felt the same lack of interest in alchemy and th e wisdom of their father, 
and they too k refuge in solitude. “Those kids are out of their heads,” Úrsula said. “They must hav e 
worms.” She prepared a repugnant potion for them  made ou t of mashed  wormseed, which they 
both drank with unforeseen stoicism,  and they sat do wn at the same time o n their pots eleven times  
in a single d ay, expelling some rose-colored parasites that they showed to everybody with great 
jubilation, for it allowed them to decei ve Úrsula as to the origin of their distractions and drowsiness.  
Aureliano not only understood by then, he also lived  his brother’s experiences as something of his 
own, for on one occasio n when the l atter was ex plaining in great detail th e mechanis m of love, he 
interrupted him to ask: “What does it feel like?” José Arcadio gave an immediate reply: 
“It’s like an earthquake.” 
One January Thursday at two o’clock  in the morn ing, Amaranta was born. Before anyo ne came 
into the room, Úrsula examined her carefully. She was light and watery, like a newt, but all of her 
parts were human: Aureliano did not notice the n ew thing except when the house b ecame full of 
people. Protected by the confusion, he went off in se arch of his brother, who had not been in bed  
since eleven  o’clock, and it was such an impulsive decision tha t he did n ot even have time to ask 
himself how he could  get him ou t of Pilar Tern era’s bedroom. He circl ed the hous e for several  
hours, whistling private calls, until the proximity of dawn forced him to go home. In his mother’s 
room, playing with the newborn little sister and with a face that drooped wi th innocence, he found 
José Arcadio. 
Úrsula was barely over her for ty days’ rest when the gypsies returned. They were the same 
acrobats an d jugglers that had  brought the i ce. Unlike Melquíades’ tribe, they ha d shown very 
quickly that they were not heralds of progress but purveyors of amusement. Even  when they 
brought the ice they did not advertise it for its us efulness in the life of man but as a simple circus 
curiosity. This time, along with many other arti fices, they bro ught a flying carpet. But they did no t 
offer it as a  fundamenta l contributio n to the d evelopment o f transport, rather as an  object of 
recreation. T he people at once dug up  their last gold  pieces to take advantage of a quick flight over 
the houses  of the village. Protected  by the delightful cover of collective dis order, José Arcadio and  
Pilar passed many relaxing hours . They were two  happy lovers among th e crowd, and  they even  
came to sus pect tha t love could be a feeling that  was more relaxing and deep than the happiness, 
wild but m omentary, o f their secret nights. Pila r, however, broke the spell. Stimulated b y the 
enthusiasm that José Arcadio showed in her  companionship, she conf used the form and th e 
occasion, and all of a sudden she threw the whole world on top of him. “Now you really are a man,” 
she told him. And since h e did not understand wh at she meant,  she spelled it out to him.  
“You’re goin g to be a father.” 
José Arcadio did not dar e leave the house for se veral days. It was enough for him to  hear th e 
rocking laughter of Pilar in the kitchen to run and take refuge in the laboratory, where the artifacts 
of alchemy h ad come alive again wi th Úrsula’s blessing. José Arcadio Buen día received hi s errant so n 
with joy and initiated him in the search for the philosopher’s stone, which he  had finally undertaken.  
One afterno on the boys grew enthusi astic over th e flying carpet th at went swiftly by th e laborator y 
 21GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
at window level carrying the gypsy who was driving it and several children from the village who were 
merrily waving their hands, but José Arcadio Buendía  did not even look at it. “Let them dream,” he 
said. “We’ll do better flyi ng than they are doing, an d with mor e scientific resources tha n a miserable 
bedspread.” In spite of his feigned interest, Jo sé Arcadio must unders tood the p owers of the 
philosopher’s egg, which to him looked like a poorly  blown bottle. He did  not succeed  in escaping 
from his wo rries. He lost  his appetite and he could not sleep. He fell into an ill humor, t he same as 
his father’s over the failure of his undertakings , and such was his upset that José Arcadio Buendía 
himself relieved him of his duties in the laborator y, thinking that he had  taken alchemy too much to  
heart. Aureliano, of course, understood that his brother’s affliction did not have its source in the 
search for the philosopher’s stone but he could  not get into his  confidence. He had lost his former 
spontaneity.  From an accomplice and a communi cative person he had  become wi thdrawn and  
hostile. Anxious for solitude, bitten b y a virulent r ancor against the world, one  night he left his bed  
as usual, but  he did not go to Pilar Ternera’s house , but to mingle is the tumult of t he fair. After 
wandering about among all kinds of contraptions  with out becoming interested in any of them, he 
spotted som ething that was not a part of it all:  a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, who was  
weighted down by beads and was the most beautiful woman that José Arcadio had ever seen in his 
life. She was in the crowd that was witnessing th e sad spectacle of the man who ha d been turned  
into a snake for having disobeyed his parents. 
José Arcadio paid no attention. While the sad in terrogation of th e snake-man was taking pl ace, he 
made his way through the crowd up to the front row, where the gypsy girl  was, and he stooped  
behind her. He pressed against her back. The girl tried to separate herself, but José Arcadio pressed  
more strongly against her  back. Then she felt hi m. She remained motionless  against him, trembling 
with surprise and fear, unable to believe the evidence, and finally she turned her head a nd looked at 
him with a tremulous smile. At that in stant two gypsies put the snake-man into his cage and carried 
him into the tent. The gypsy who was  conducting the show ann ounced: 
“And now, l adies and gentlemen, we are going to  show the ter rible test of the woman  who must 
have her head chopped  off every night at this time  for one hundred and fifty years as pu nishment 
for having se en what she should not have.” 
José Arcadio  and the gyp sy girl did not witn ess the decapitati on. They went to  her tent, wher e 
they kissed each o ther with a d esperate anxiety while  they took off their clothes. T he gypsy girl 
removed the starched la ce corsets she had on and  there she was, changed i nto practicall y nothing. 
She was a languid little frog, with incipient breasts  and legs so thin that they did not even match th e 
size of José Arcadio’s arms, but she had a decision and a warmth that  compensated for her fragility.  
Nevertheless , José Arcad io could not respond to her because they were in a kind of public tent 
where th e gypsies passed through with their circus things an d did their b usiness, and would even  
tarry by the bed for a ga me of dice. The lamp ha nging from the cen ter po le lighted the whole place  
up. During a pause in  the caresses,  José Arcadio  stretched  out naked  on the bed  with out knowing  
what to do, while the girl tried to  inspire him. A gypsy woma n with splen did flesh ca me in a  shor t 
time after accompanied by a ma n who was not of the carav an bu t who was not from the village 
either, and they both began to undress in front of the bed. Without meani ng to, the woman looked 
at José Arca dio and examined his magnificent an imal in repose with a kind  of pathetic fervor. 
“My boy,” she exclaimed , “may God preserve you just as you a re.” 
José Arcadio’s companion asked them to leave them alone, and the cou ple lay down on the 
ground, close to th e bed . The passion of the oth ers woke up  José Arcadi o’s fervor. On the first 
contact the b ones of the g irl seemed to  become disj ointed with  a disorderly crunch like the sound of  
a box of do minoes, and her skin  broke out into a pale sweat and her eyes filled with  tears as her 
whole body exhaled a lugubrious lament and a vagu e smell of mud. But she bore the impact with a 
firmness of character an d a bravery that were ad mirable. José Arcadio felt himself lifted up into th e 
 22GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
air toward a state of seraphic inspiration, where hi s heart burst forth with an outpouring of tender 
obscenities that entered the girl through her ears and cam e out of her mouth translated into her  
language. It was Thursday. On Saturday night, Jo sé Arcadio wrapped a r ed cloth around his head 
and left with  the gypsies. 
When Úrsula discovered his absenc e she searched for him all through the village. In the remains 
of the gyps y camp ther e was nothing but a ga rbage pit a mong the still smokin g ashes of the 
extinguished campfires. Someone who  was there l ooking for beads among the trash told Úrsula that 
the night before he had seen her son in the tumult  of the caravan pushing the snake-man’s cage on a  
cart. “He’s become a gypsy” she shouted to her husband, who had not shown the slightest sign of 
alarm over the disappear ance. 
“I hope it’s true,” José Arcadio Buendía said, gr inding in his mortar th e material that had been 
ground a thousand times and reheated  and ground again. “That way he’ll learn to be a man.” Úrsula 
asked where the gypsies  had gone. She went al ong asking and following the road s he had b een 
shown, thinking that she still had time to catch up  to them.  She kept getting  farther away from the 
village until she felt so far  away that she did not think about returning. José Arcadio Buendía did not 
discover that his wife was missing until eight o’cloc k at night, when he left the material warming in a 
bed of manure and went to see wha t was wrong wi th little Amaranta, wh o was gettin g hoarse from 
crying. In a few hours he gather ed a group of w ell-equipped men, put Amaranta in the hands of a 
woman who  offered to nurse her, and was lost on invisible paths in pur suit of Úrsula. Aureliano 
went with th em. Some Indian fishermen, whose language they could not understand, told them with  
signs that th ey had no t seen anyone pass. After th ree days of useless searching they returned to the  
village. 
For several weeks José Arcadio Buendía let himself be overcome by consternation. He took care 
of little Ama ranta like a mother. He bathed and d ressed her, took her to be nursed four times a day, 
and even san g to her at n ight the son gs that Úrsula never knew how to si ng. On a cer tain occasion  
Pilar Ternera volunteered to do the household c hores until Úrsula came back. Aureliano, whos e 
mysterious intuition had become sh arpened with the misfortune, felt a glow of clairvoyance when he  
saw her com e in. Then he knew tha t in some inex plicable way she was to blame for his brother’s  
flight and t he consequent disappearance of his mother, and he harassed her with a silent an d 
implacable h ostility in such a way th at the woman d id not return to the house. 
Time put things in their place. José Arcadio Bue ndía and his son did not know exactly when they 
returned to the laboratory, dusting things, lighting  the water pi pe, involved once more in the patient 
manipulation  of the material that had been sleepin g for several months in its bed of manure. Even 
Amaranta, lying in a wicker basket, observed with cu riosity the absorbing work of her father and her  
brother in the small room where the air was rarefied by mercury vapors. On a certain occasion,  
months after Úrsu la’s d eparture, strange things began to happen. An empty flask that had been 
forgotten in a cupboard for a long time became so heavy that i t could not be moved. A pan of water  
on the worktable boiled without any fire under it for a half hour until it completely eva porated. Jos é 
Arcadio Buendía and his son observed those phenomena  with  startled excitement, unabl e to explain  
them but in terpreting them as predictions of th e material. One day Amaranta’s ba sket began to  
move by itself and made a comp lete turn about th e room, to  the consternation of Auer liano, who 
hurried to stop it. But his father did not get upset. He put the b asket in its place and tied i t to the leg 
of a table, convinced that the long-awaited event was imm inent. It wa s on that occasion that 
Auerliano heard him say: 
“If you don’t fear God, fear him through the metal s. 
Suddenly, almost five months after her disappe arance, Úrsula came b ack. She arrived exalted,  
rejuvenated, with new clothes in a style that was unknown in the village. José Arcadio Buendía could 
barely stand up under the impact. “That was it!” he shouted. “I knew it was going to happen.” And 
 23GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
he really bel ieved it, for during his prolonged imprisonment as he man ipulated the material, he 
begged in the depth of his heart that the longed -for miracle should not be the disco very of the 
philosopher’s stone, or t he freeing of the breath that  makes metals live, or the faculty to convert the 
hinges and the locks of the house into gold, but wh at had just happened: Úrsula’s return. But she did 
not share his  excitem ent. She gave hi m a conventiona l kiss, as if she had been away only an hour, 
and she told him: 
“Look out the door.” 
José Arcadio Buendía took a long time to get o ut of his perplexity when  he went ou t into th e 
street and  saw th e crowd. They were not gypsie s. They were men  and women like them, wi th 
straight hair and dark skin, who spoke the same la nguage and complained  of the same pains. They 
had mules l oaded down  with things to ea t, oxcar ts with  furniture and d omestic u tensils, pure and 
simple earthl y accessories put on sale without any fuss by peddlers of everyday reality.  They came 
from the other side of the swamp, o nly two da ys away, wh ere there were towns that received mail 
every month in the year and where they were familia r with the implements of good living. Úrsu la 
had not caug ht up with the gypsies, b ut she h ad found the route th at her husband had  been  unable 
to discover in his frustrated search for the great inventions. 
 24GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Chapter 3 
PILAR TER NERA’S  son was brought to his grand parents’ ho use two week s after he wa s born. Úrsula  
admitted hi m grudgingly, conquered once more by the obstinacy of her husband, who could not 
tolerate the idea that an offshoot of his blood shou ld be adrift, but he imposed the condition that 
the child sh ould never know his true identity. Alt hough he was given the name José Arcadio, they 
ended up calling him simply Arcadio so as to av oid confusion. At that time there was so much 
activity in th e town and s o much bustle in the house that th e care of the ch ildren was relegated to a  
secondary level. They were put in the care of Visi tación, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in 
town with a  brother in flight fr om a plague of insomnia that ha d been  scourging their tribe for  
several years. They were both so docile and willin g to help th at Úrsula to ok them on to help her 
with her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Amaranta ca me to speak the Guajiro 
language before Spanish, and they lear ned to drin k lizard broth and eat spider eggs without Úrsula’s 
knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising business in candy animals . Macondo had changed.  
The people who had come with Úrsula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its 
privileged p osition with respect to the swamp, so that from the narrow village of past times it 
changed into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent commercial route over 
which the first Arabs arrived with thei r baggy pants and rings in their ears, swapping glass beads for 
macaws. Jos é Arcadio  Buendía did not have a  mom ent’s rest. Fa scinated b y an immediate reality tha t 
came to b e more fantastic than  the vast universe  of his imagination, he lost all interest in the 
alchemist’s laboratory, put to rest the material  that had become a ttenuated with  months o f 
manipulation , and went back to bein g the enterp rising man of earlier days when he h ad decided  
upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one would enjo y 
privileges that everyone did not  have. He acquired such authority among the new arrivals that  
foundations were not laid or walls b uilt without his being consulted, and  it was d ecided that h e 
should be the one in charge of the distribution of  the land. Wh en the acrob at gypsies returned, with  
their vagabond carnival transformed now into a giga ntic organization of games of luck and chance, 
they were received with great joy, for it was thou ght that José Arcadio wo uld be comi ng back with  
them. But J osé Arcadio did not return, nor did th ey com e with the sn ake-man, who, according to  
what Úrsula thought, was the only one who could te ll them about their son, so the gypsies were no t 
allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in the future, for they were considered th e bearers o f 
concupiscence and  perversion. José Arcadio Buendía, however , was explicit in maintaining that the 
old tribe of Melquíades, who had contributed so much  to the growth of the village with his age-old  
wisdom and  his fabulous inventions, would alwa ys find the gates open. But Melquíades’ tribe, 
according to  what the wanderers sai d, had been  wiped off the face of th e earth b ecause they had 
gone beyond  the limits of human knowledge. 
Emancipated  for the mo ment a t least from the torment of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía in a  
short time s et up a  system of order a nd work wh ich allowed  for only one bit of license: the freeing  
of the birds, which, since the time o f the founding, had made time merry with their flutes, and  
installing in their place musical clocks in ever y house. They were wondr ous clocks made of car ved 
wood, which  the Arabs  had traded  for macaws  and which José Arcadio  Buendía had  synchronized  
with such precision that every half hour the town  grew merry with the progressive chords of the 
same song until it reached the climax of a noontim e that was as exact and unanimous as a complete  
waltz. It was also José Arcadi o Buendía who d ecided during those years  that they s hould plant 
almond trees instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered, without ever revealing it, a way 
to make them live forever. Many years later, when Macondo was a field of wooden houses with zinc 
 25GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still st ood on the oldest streets, although no one knew 
who had planted them. While his father was putti ng the to wn in order and his mother was increasing 
their wealth  with her ma rvelous business of cand ied little roo sters and fish, which left the house 
twice a da y strung along sticks of  balsa wood, Aureliano spent inter minable hours in the abandoned  
laboratory, learning the art of silv erwork by his own experimentation. He had shot up so fast that in 
a short time the clothing left behind by his  brother no long er fit him and he began to wear his  
father’s, but Visitación ha d to sew pleats in th e shirt and darts i n the p ants, because Aureliano ha d 
not sequined  the corpulence of the others. Adolescen ce had taken away the softness of his voice and 
had made him silent and definitely solitary, but, on the other hand, it had restored the intens e 
expression that he had had in his eyes when he  was born. He concentrated so much on his 
experiments  in silverwork that h e scarcely left the l aboratory to eat. Worried ever his inner  
withdrawal, José Arcadio Buendía gave him the keys  to the ho use and a little money, th inking that 
perhaps he n eeded a wo man. But Au reliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepa re some aqu a 
regia and he beautified th e keys by pla ting them with gold. His excesses wer e hardly co mparable to 
those of Ar cadio and Amaranta, who had already begun to get their second teeth and still went  
about all day clutching at the Indians’ cloaks, stu bborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the 
Guajiro language. “You shouldn’t complain.” Úr sula told her husband. “Children inherit their 
parents’ madness.” And as she was lamenting her mi sfortune, convinced that the wild behavior of 
her children was somethi ng as fearful as a pig’s tail,  Aureliano gave her a look that wrapped her in an 
atmosphere of uncertainty. 
“Somebody is coming,” he told her. 
Úrsula, as she did whenever he made a prediction,  tried to break it down with her housewifely 
logic. It  was normal for someone to be coming. Dozens of strangers came through Mac ondo every 
day without arousing suspicion or se cret ideas. Nevertheless, beyond all log ic, Aureliano was sure of 
his prediction. 
“I don’t kno w who it will be,” he insisted, “but whoever it is is already on the way.” 
That Sunday, in fact, Rebeca arrived. She was onl y eleven year s old. She had made the difficult 
trip from Manaure with  some hide dealers who h ad taken  on the task  of delivering her along with a  
letter to José Arcadio Buendía, but they could not  explain precisely who the person was who had  
asked the favor. Her entire baggage consisted of a small trunk, a little rocking chair with small hand-
painted flowers, and a canvas sack which kept making a cloc-cloc-cloc sound, where she carried her  
parents’ bones. The letter addressed to José Arca dio Buendía was written is very  warm terms by 
someone who still loved him very mu ch in spite of time and distan ce, and who felt obliged by a 
basic humanitarian feeling to do the charitable thing and send him that poor unsheltered orphan, 
who was  a second cous in of Úrsula’s and conseque ntly also a relative of José Arcadio Buendía,  
although farther removed , because sh e was the da ughter of that unforgetta ble friend Nicanor Ulloa 
and his very worthy wife Rebeca Montiel, may Go d keep them in His holy kingdom, whose remains 
the girl was carrying so that they might be given Christian burial. The names mention ed, as well a s 
the signature on the letter, were perfectly legible,  but neither José Arcadio, Buendía nor Úrsula 
remembered  having any relatives with those nam es, nor did they know anyone  by the name of the 
sender of the letter, much less the remote village of  Manaure. It was impossible to obtain any further 
information from the girl. From  the moment she a rrived she had been sittin g in the rocker, sucking 
her finger and observing everyone with h er larg e, startled eyes  with out giving any sign of 
understanding what they were asking her. She wore  a diagonally striped dress that had been dyed 
black, worn by use, and a pair of scaly patent leat her boots. Her hair was held behind her ears with 
bows of black ribbon. She wore a scapular with th e images worn away by sweat, and on her right  
wrist the fang of a carniv orous animal mounted  on a backing of copper as an amulet against the evil  
eye. Her greenish skin, her stomach, round and te nse as a dr um. revealed  poor health  and hunger 
 26GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
that were ol der than sh e was, but when they gav e her som ething to eat s he kept the plate on her 
knees witho ut tasting an ything. They even began to think that she was a d eaf-mute until the Indians 
asked her in their language if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes as if she recognized 
them and sai d yes with her head. 
They kept h er, because there was nothing else they could do. They decided to call her Rebeca , 
which accor ding to the letter was her  mother’s name, because Aureliano had the patience to read to  
her the names of all the saints and he did not g et a reaction from any one of them. Since there wa s 
no cemetery in Macondo at that time , for no one had died up til l then, they k ept the bag of bones to 
wait for a worthy place of burial, and for a long  time it got in the wa y everywhere a nd would be 
found where least expected, always with its clucki ng of a broody hen. A long time passed before 
Rebeca b ecame incorporated into the life of the fa mily. She would sit in her small rocker sucking her  
finger in the most remote corner of the house. Nothing attracted her atten tion except the music of 
the clocks, which she would look for every half hour with her frightened eyes as if she hoped to find 
it someplace in the air. They could n ot get her to  eat for several days. No one understood why she  
had not died  of hunger until the Indi ans, who we re aware of everything, for they went ceaselessly 
about the ho use on their stealthy feet,  discovered that Rebeca o nly liked to eat the d amp earth of the 
courtyard an d the cake o f whitewash that she pick ed of the wa lls with her nails. It was obvious that 
her parents, or whoever had raised her, had scolde d her for that habit beca use she did it secretively 
and with a feeling of guilt, tryi ng to put awa y supplies so th at she could  eat when n o one was  
looking. From then on they put her under an implacable watch. They threw cow gall onto the 
courtyard and, rubbed hot chili on the walls, thinki ng they could defeat her pernicious vice with 
those m ethods, but she showed such signs of a stuteness an d ingenuity to find som e earth  that 
Úrsula found herself forced to use more drastic methods. She put some orange juice and rhubarb  
into a pan th at she left in the dew all n ight and she gave her the dose the following day on an empty 
stomach. Although no one had told her that it was the sp ecific remedy  for the vice of eating earth,  
she thought that any bitter substance in an emp ty stomach would have to make the liver react. 
Rebeca was so rebellious and strong in spite of her fra ilness that they had to tie her up like a calf to 
make her swallow the m edicine, and they could b arely keep b ack her kicks or bear up under the 
strange hieroglyphics that she alter nated with her bites and spi tting, and th at, according to wha t the 
scandalized I ndians said, were the vilest obscenities that one could ever imagine in their language. 
When Úrsula discovered that, she added whipping to the treatment. It was never estab lished 
whether it was the rhuba rb or the beatings that h ad effect, or both of them together, but the truth  
was that in a few weeks  Rebeca b egan to show signs of recovery. She took part in the games o f 
Arcadio and  Amaran ta, who trea ted her like an o lder sister, a nd she a te heartily, using the u tensils  
properly. It was soon revealed that s he spoke Spanis h with as  much fluency as  the Ind ian language, 
that she had  a remarkable ability for manual work, and that she could sing the waltz of the clocks 
with some very funny words that she herself had inve nted. It did not take long for them to consider 
her anoth er memb er of the family. She was m ore affectio nate to Úrs ula than  any of her own  
children had been, and s he called Arcadio, and Am aranta bro ther and sister, Aureliano uncle, and  
José Arcadio Buendía grandpa. So that she finally deserved, as much as the others, the name of 
Rebeca Buen día, the only one that sh e ever had an d that she bor e with dignity until her death. 
One night about the tim e that Reb eca was cured of the vice of eating earth and was b rought to 
sleep in the other children’s room, the Indian woman, who slept with them awoke by chance and 
heard a stra nge, intermittent sound i n the corner.  She got up in alarm, thinking that an animal ha d 
come into the room, and then she s aw Rebeca in the rocker, sucking her finger and with her eye s 
lighted up in the darknes s like those of a cat. T errified, exhausted by h er fate, Visita ción recognized  
in those eyes the symptoms of the sickness whose threat ha d obliged her and her brother to exil e 
 27GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
themselves forever from an age-old kingdom wher e they had b een prince a nd princess. It was the 
insomnia plague. 
Cataure, the Indian, was gone from the house by morning. His sister stayed because her fatalisti c 
heart told her that the lethal sickness would follow her, no matter what, to the farthest corner of the 
earth. No on e understood  Visitación’s alarm. “If we don’t ever sleep again, so much the b etter,” José 
Arcadio Buendía said in good humor. “That wa y we can get more out of life.” But the Indian  
woman explained that th e most fearsome part of the sickness of insomnia was not the impossibility 
of sleeping, for the body did not feel  any fatigue at  all, but its inexorable evolution toward a more 
critical mani festation: a l oss of mem ory. She meant tha t when the sick p erson becam e used to  his 
state of vigil, the recollection of his childhood bega n to be erased from his memory, then the name 
and notion of things, and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of his own being, 
until he sank into a kind of idiocy that had no  past. José Arcadio Buendía, dying with laughter, 
thought that it was just a question of one of th e many illnesses invented by the Indians’ supersti-
tions. But Úrsula, just to be safe, took the precaut ion of isolating Rebeca from the other children. 
After several weeks, when Visitación’s terror seem ed to have died down, José Arcadio Buendía  
found himself rollin g over in bed, unable to fall asleep. Úrsula, who had al so awakened, asked him 
what was wrong, and he answered: “I’m thinking  about Prudencio Aguilar again.” They did no t 
sleep a minute, but the following day they felt so rested th at they forgot about the bad night. 
Aureliano commented with surprise at lunchtime th at he felt very well in spite of the fact that he had  
spent the whole night in the laborato ry gilding a br ooch that he planned to give to Úrsula for her  
birthday. They did not b ecome alarm ed until the third day, when no one felt sleepy at b edtime an d 
they realized that th ey had  gone more  than fifty hours without sleeping. 
“The children are awake too,” the Indian said with  her fatalistic conviction. “Once it gets into a 
house no one can escape the plague.” 
They had indeed contracted the illness of insomn ia. Úrsula, who had learned from her mother  
the medicina l value of plants, prepared and made  them all drink a brew of monkshood, but they 
could not get to sleep an d spent the whole day dr eaming on their feet. In that sta te of hallucinated  
lucidity, not only did they see the imag es of thei r own dreams, but some sa w the images  dreamed b y 
others. It was as if the house were full of visitors. Sitting in her rocker in a corner of the kitchen , 
Rebeca  drea med tha t a man who  looked very m uch lik e her, dressed in white linen an d with his sh irt 
collar closed by a gold button, was bringing he r a bouquet of roses. He was accompanied by a 
woman with  delicate h ands who took  out one ros e and put it i n the child’s hair. Úrsula understood 
that the m an and wom an were Rebeca’s paren ts, but even though she made a great effort to 
recognize them, she confirmed her certainty tha t she had never seen them. In the meantime,  
through an oversight that José Arcadi o Buendía ne ver forgave himself for, the candy a nimals made 
in the house were still being sold in the town.  Children and adults sucked with delight on the 
delicious little green roosters of insomnia, the exquisi te pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yello w 
ponies of insomnia, so that dawn on Monday foun d the whol e town awak e. No one was alarmed at 
first. On the contrary, they were h appy at not sleep ing because there was so  much to do  in Macon do 
in those days that there was barely enough time . They worked so hard that soon they had nothing 
else to d o and they could be found at three o’cloc k in the m orning with their  arms crossed, counting  
the notes  in the waltz of the clock. T hose who wan ted to sl eep, not from fatigue but because of th e 
nostalgia for dreams, tried all kinds of method s of exhausting themselves. They would gather 
together to converse endlessly, to tell over and ov er for hours on end the sa me jokes, to complicate 
to the limits  of exasperation the s tory about the capon, which was an endless game i n which the 
narrator asked if they wa nted him to  tell them the story about the capo n, and when th ey answered  
yes, the narrator would say that he ha d not asked them to say yes, but whether they wa nted him to  
tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered no, the narrator told them that he had  
 28GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
not asked them to say no, but whether they wanted  him to tell them the st ory about the capon, and  
when they r emained silent the narrator told them that he had  not asked them to rema in silent but 
whether they wanted him  to tell th em the story abo ut the capo n, and no  one could leave b ecause th e 
narrator would say that he had not a sked them to leave but whether they wanted him  to tell them 
the story abo ut the cap on, and so on a nd on in a vicious circle that lasted en tire nights. 
When José Arcadio Buendía realized that the pla gue had invaded the town, he gathered together  
the heads of  families to explain to them what he knew about the sickness of insomnia, and they 
agreed on m ethods to pr event the scourge from sp reading to other towns  in the swa mp. That wa s 
why they to ok the bells off the goats, bells that the Arabs ha d swapped them for macaws, and put 
them at the entrance to  town at th e disposal of those who  would not listen to the advice and  
entreaties of  the sentinel s and insisted on visiti ng the town. All strangers who passed  through the 
streets of Macondo at th at time had to ring their bells so that the sick people would know that they  
were healthy. They were not allowed  to eat or dr ink anything during their stay, for th ere was n o 
doubt but that the illness  was tran smitted by mou th, and all food and drink had been contaminated 
by insomnia.  In tha t way they kept th e plague re stricted to  the perimeter o f the to wn. So effective 
was the quarantine that the day came when the emergency situation was a ccepted as a natural thing  
and life was organized in such a way that work pi cked up its r hythm again and no one worried an y 
more about the useless habit of sleeping. 
It was Aureliano who con ceived the formula that was to protect them against loss of memory for 
several months. He discovered it by chance. An expe rt insomniac, having been one of the first, he 
had learned the art of silverwork to perfection. One day he was look ing for the small anvil that he 
used for la minating metals and he could not reme mber its name. His father told him: “Stake.” 
Aureliano wr ote the name on a piece of paper that he pasted to  the bas e of the small anvi l: stake. In 
that way h e was sure of not forgetting it in the fu ture. It did n ot occur to  him that this  was th e first 
manifestatio n of a loss of memory, because the o bject had a d ifficult name to remember. But a few 
days later be, discovered that he had trouble remembering almost every object in the laboratory.  
Then he mar ked them wi th their respective names  so that all h e had to do was read the inscription 
in order to identify them . When his father told him about his alarm at ha ving forgott en even the 
most impressive happenings of his childhood, Aureliano explained his method to him, and José 
Arcadio Buendía put it i nto practi ce all through the house an d later on  imposed it o n the whole 
village. With  an inked brush he marked everything with its name: table, chai r, clock, door, wall, bed, pan . 
He wen t to the corral an d marked th e animals an d plants: cow, goat, pig, hen, cassava, caladium, banana . 
Little by little, studying the infinite possibilities of  a loss of memory, he realized that the day might 
come wh en things would be recognized by th eir inscriptions but tha t no on e would remember thei r 
use. Then he was more explicit. The sign that he  hung on th e neck of th e cow was a n exemplar y 
proof of the way in which the inhabitants of Ma condo were prepared  to fight against loss of  
memory: This is the cow. She must  be mil ked every morning so  that she will produc e milk, and the milk must be 
boiled in order to be mixed wi th coffee to make coffee and milk . Thus they wen t on living in a reality that was  
slipping away, momentar ily captured  by words, but which  would escape irremediably when  they 
forgot the values of the written letters.  
At the beginning of the road into the swamp they put up a sign that said MACONDO  and another  
larger one on the main street that sai d GOD EXI STS. In all the houses keys to memorizing objects 
and feelings had been written. But the system dem anded so much vigilance and moral strength tha t 
many succu mbed to the spell of an imaginary reality, one invented by th emselves, which was les s 
practical for them but more comforting. Pilar Ternera was the one who contributed most to  
popularize that mystification when she conceived th e trick of reading the  past in cards as she had  
read the future before. By means of that recourse  the insomniacs began to live in a world built on 
the uncertain  alternatives of the cards, where a fa ther was remembered faintly as the dark man who  
 29GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
had arrived at the beginning of April and a mo ther was rem embered only as the dark woman who  
wore a gold ring on her le ft hand, and where a bi rth date was reduced to the last Tuesday on which a  
lark sang in the laurel tree. Defeated by those pr actices of con solation, José Arcadio B uendía then 
decided to build the memory machi ne that he ha d desired once in order to remember the marvelous 
inventions of the gypsies. The artifact was based on the possibility of review ing every morning, from 
beginning to end, the to tality of knowledge acqu ired during one’s life. He conceived  of it as a 
spinning dict ionary that a person placed on the axis  could ope rate by means of a lever, so that in a 
very few hours there would pass before his eyes the no tions most necessary for life. He had  
succeeded in  writing almost fourteen thousand entries when  along the road from the swamp a  
strange-looking old man with the sad sleepers’ bell appeared, carrying a bulging suitcase tied with a 
rope and pulling a cart covered with black cloth. He went str aight to the house of José Arcadio 
Buendía. 
Visitación did not recognize him when she opened the door and she thought he had come with 
the idea of selling something, unaware that nothi ng could be sold in a town that was sinking 
irrevocably into the quicksand of forgetfulness. He was a decrepit man. Alt hough his voice was  also 
broken by uncertainty an d his hands seemed to  doubt the existence of thin gs, it was evident tha t he 
came from the world where men could still sleep and remember. José Arcadio Buendía found him 
sitting in the living room fanning himself with a patched bla ck hat as he read with compassionate 
attention the signs pasted to the walls. He greeted him with a broad show of affection, afraid that h e 
had known him at another time and that he did not remember  him now. But the visitor was aware 
of his falseness, He felt himself forgotten, no t with the irrem ediable forgetfulness of the heart,  but 
with a different kind of forgetfulness, which was more cruel a nd irrevocable and which he knew ver y 
well because it was the forgetfulness of death.  Then he understood. He opened the suitcas e 
crammed wi th indecipherable objects  and from a mong then he took out a little case with man y 
flasks. He ga ve José Arcadio Buendía a drink of a gentle color and the light went on in his memory.  
His eyes b ecame moist from weepin g even befo re he noti ced himself in an absurd l iving room 
where objects were labeled and before he was ashame d of the s olemn nonsense written o n the walls , 
and even bef ore he recognized the n ewcomer with  a dazzling glow of joy. It was Melquíades. 
While Macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory, José A rcadio Buendía and 
Melquíades dusted off their old friendship. The gypsy was incli ned to sta y in the town. He really ha d 
been throug h death, bu t he had returned because he  could no t bear th e solitude. Repud iated by his 
tribe, having lost all of his supernatural  faculties be cause of his fa ithfulness to life, he decid ed to take 
refuge in that corner of the world which had still not been discovered by death, dedicated to the 
operation of a daguerreotype laboratory. José Arca dio Buend ía had never  heard of that invention.  
But when h e saw himself and his whole family fastened onto a sheet of iridescent metal for an 
eternity, he was mute wi th stupef action. That wa s the da te of the oxid ized daguerreotype in which  
José Arcadio  Buendía ap peared with  his bristly an d graying hair, his card board collar attached  to his  
shirt by a copper button, and an ex pression of st artled solemnity, whom Úrsula described, dying 
with laughter, as a “frightened gener al.” José Arcadi o Buendía was, in fact, frightened on that dea r 
Decemb er morning when the daguerr eotype was made , for he was thinkin g that people were slowly 
wearing away while his image would endure an a metallic plaque. Through a curious reversal of 
custom, it was Úrsula who got that i dea out of h is head, as it was also sh e who forgot her ancient 
bitterness an d decided th at Melquíades would stay on in the h ouse, although she never permitted  
them to m ake a daguerreotype of her because (a ccording to her very words) she did not want to  
survive as a laughingstock for her grandchildren. Th at morning she dressed the children in their best 
clothes, powdered their faces, and gave a spoonful of marrow syrup to each one so that they would  
all remain a bsolutely m otionless during the nea rly two min utes in front of Melquíades fantastic  
camera. In the family da guerreotype, the only on e that ever existed, Aureliano appeared dressed i n 
 30GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
black velvet between Am aranta and  Rebeca. H e had the sa me la nguor and the same clairvoyant loo k 
that he would have years later as h e faced the firing squa d. But he s till had not sensed the 
premonition of his fate. He was an expert silve rsmith, praised all over the swampland for the 
delicacy of his work. In the workshop, which he s hared with Melquíades’ mad laboratory, he coul d 
barely be heard breathing. He seemed to be taking  refuge in some other ti me, while his father and 
the gypsy wi th shouts interpreted the predictions of  Nostradam us amidst a noise of flasks and trays 
and the disaster of spille d acids and silver bromide th at was lost in the twists and turns it gave at 
every instant. That dedica tion to his work, the g ood judgment with which he directed his attention,  
had allowed Aureliano to  earn in a short time more money tha n Úrsula had with her delicious cand y 
fauna, but everybody th ought it strange that he was now a full-grown man and had not known a 
woman. It was true that he had never had one. 
Several mon ths later s aw the return o f Francisco the Man, as  ancient vagab ond who wa s almost 
two hundred years old  and who  frequently pass ed through Macondo di stributing songs that he 
composed hi mself. In them Francisco the Man tol d in great detail the thing s that had h appened in  
the towns  along his route, from Manaure to the edge  of the swamp, so that if anyone had a message 
to send or an event to m ake public, he would pay him two cen ts to include it in his repertory. That 
was how Úr sula learned of the death of her mother , as a simple conseq uence of listening to the 
songs in the hope that they would say something a bout her son José Arcadio. Francisco the Man,  
called that b ecause he h ad once defea ted the d evil in a duel of improvisation, and whose real name 
no one knew, disappeared from Ma condo during th e insomnia plague and one night he appeared 
suddenly in Catarino’s store. The whole town went to listen to him to find out what h ad happened  
in the world. On that occasion there a rrived with him a woman who was so fat that four Indians had 
to carry her in a rocking chair, and an adolescent m ulatto girl with a forlorn look who protected her  
from the su n with an u mbrella. Aureliano wen t to Catarino’s store that night. He found Francisco 
the Man, like a monolith ic chameleo n, sitting in the midst of a circle of bystanders. He was singing 
the news with his old, ou t-of-tune voice, accompa nying himself with the sa me archai c accordion tha t 
Sir Walter Raleigh had given him in the Guianas an d keeping time with his great walking feet that 
were cracked from saltpeter. In front of a door  at the rear through which men were going and 
coming, the matron of th e rocking chair was sittin g and fanning herself in silence. Catari no, with a 
felt rose behind his ear, was selling the gatherin g mugs of fermented cane juice, and he took  
advantage of  the o ccasio n to go over  to th e men and put his hand on them where he should not 
have. Toward midnight the heat was unbearable. Aureliano listened to the news to the end without 
hearing anything that wa s of interest to his fa mily. He was g etting ready to go home when  the 
matron signaled him with her hand. 
“You go in too.” she told him. “It only costs twenty cents.” 
Aureliano th rew a coin i nto the hop per that the matron had in her lap an d went in to the room  
without kno wing why. The adolescen t mulatto  girl, with her s mall bitch’s teats, was na ked on the 
bed. Before Aureliano sixty-three men had passed  through the room that night. From being used so 
much, kneaded with swea t and sighs, the air in the room had begun to turn to mud. The girl took 
off the soaked sheet and a sked Aureliano to hold it by one side. It was as heavy as a piece of canvas.  
They squeezed it, twisting it at the ends until it re gained its natural weight. They turned over the mat  
and the swea t cam e out o f the oth er side. Aurelian o was anxious for that op eration never  to end.  He 
knew the theoretical mechanics of love, but he cou ld not sta y on his feet because of th e weakness of  
his knees, and although he had goose pimples on hi s burning skin he could not resist the urgent 
need to expel the weight of his bowels. When the girl  finished fixing up the bed and told him to get  
undressed, he gave her a confused explanation: “They mad e me com e in. They told me to throw 
twenty cen ts into the ho pper and hu rry up.” The girl understood his confusion. “If you throw in  
twenty cents  more when  you go ou t, you can s tay a little lon ger,” she said softly. Au reliano got 
 31GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
undressed, tormented by shame, una ble to get ri d of the idea that-his na kedness coul d not stan d 
comparison with that of his brother. In spite of t he girl’ s effo rts he felt m ore and mor e indifferent 
and terribly alone. “I’ll throw in other twenty cen ts,” he said with a d esolate voice. The girl thanked 
him in silence. Her back was ra w. Her skin wa s stuck to h er ribs and her breathing was force d 
because of an immeasurable exhaustion. Two years be fore, far away from th ere, she had  fallen asleep  
without putting out the candle and ha d awakened  surrounded by flames. The house wh ere she lived  
with the grandmother who had raised her was redu ced to ash es. Since then her grandmother carri ed 
her from town to town,  putting her to bed for twen ty cents  in order to make up th e value of the 
burned house. According to the girl’s calculations , she still had ten years of seventy men per night,  
because she also had to pay the expen ses of the trip  and food for both of them as well as the pay of 
the Indians who carried the rocking chair. When the matron k nocked on the door the second time,  
Aureliano left the room without havi ng done anythi ng, troubled by a desir e to weep.  That night h e 
could not sleep, thinking about th e girl, with a mixtur e of desire and pity.  He felt an irresi stible need  
to love her a nd protect h er. At da wn, worn out by insomnia an d fever, he made th e calm decision to 
marry her in order to free  her from  the despotism of her grandmother and to enjoy all the nights of 
satisfaction that she woul d give the s eventy m en. But  at ten  o’clock in th e morning, when he reached 
Catarino’s store, the girl had left town. 
Time mitigated his mad proposal, but it aggravated his feelings of frustration. He took refuge in 
work. He resigned himself to being a womanless man for all his life in order to hide the shame of his 
uselessness. In the meantime, Melquíades had printed  on his pl ates everythi ng that was printable in 
Macondo, a nd he left th e daguerreotype laborato ry to th e fan tasies of José Arcadio B uendía  who  
had resolved  to use it to obtain scientific proof of the existen ce of God.  Through a complicated  
process of superimposed exposures taken in differe nt parts of the house, he was sure that sooner or 
later he wou ld get a daguerreotype o f God, if He existed, or put an end  once and for all to the 
supposition of His exist ence. Melquíades got deep er into his interpretations of Nostradamus. He 
would stay u p until very late, suffocating in his faded velvet vest, scribbling with his tiny sparrow 
hands, whos e rings had lost the glow of former  times. One night he thought he had found a 
prediction of the future of Macondo. It was to  be a luminous city with great glass houses where 
there was n o trace rema ining of the race of the Buendía. “It’s a mistake,” José Arcadio Buendía 
thundered. “They won’t be houses of glass but of ice, as I dreamed, and there will always be a 
Buendía, per omnia secula  seculorum .” Úrsula fought to preserve common  sense in that extravagan t 
house, having broadened her business of little candy animals with an oven that went all night turning 
out baskets a nd more bas kets of bread and a prodig ious variety of puddings, meringues, and cookies, 
which disap peared in a f ew hours on  the roads wi nding through the swamp . She had rea ched an age 
where she h ad a right to rest, but she was noneth eless more an d more activ e. So busy was she in her  
prosperous enterprises that one afternoon she looked  distractedly to ward the courtyard while th e 
Indian woman helped her sweeten the dough and she saw two unknown and beautiful adolescen t 
girls doing frame embroi dery in the light of the sunset. They were Rebeca and Amaranta. As soon as 
they had tak en off the mourning clothes for their grandmother, which they wore with inflexible 
rigor for three years, their bright clothes seem ed to have given them  a new place in the world.  
Rebeca, con trary to what might have been ex pected, was the more beautiful. She had a light 
complexion, large and peaceful eyes, and magical hand s that s eemed to work out the design of the 
embroidery with invisible threads. Amaranta, th e younger, wa s somewha t graceless, but she had the 
natural distinction, the inner tightness of her dead  grandmother. Next to them, altho ugh he was  
already revealing the physical drive of his father, Arcadio looked like a child. He set abo ut learning  
the art of si lverwork with Aureliano, who had a lso taught him how to read and wr ite. Úrsula 
suddenly rea lized that th e house had become full of  people, that her childr en were on the point of 
marrying and having children, and th at they would be obliged  to scatter for lack of spa ce. Then  she 
 32GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
took out the money she had accumul ated over long  years of hard labor, made some arrangements 
with her customers, and undertook the enlargement of the hous e. She had a formal parlor for visits 
built, another one that was more comfortable and cool  for daily use, a dinin g room with a table with  
twelve places  where the family could sit with all of their guests, nine bedrooms with windows on the 
courtyard and a long po rch protected from the he at of noon by a rose garden with a railing on 
which to place pots of ferns and begonias. She ha d the kitchen enlarged to hold two  ovens. The 
granary where Pilar Ternera had read J osé Arcadio’ s future was torn down a nd another twice as l arge 
built so that there would never be a la ck of food in the house. S he had baths  built is the courtyard in 
the shade of the chestnut tree, one for the women  and another for the men, and in the rear a large 
stable, a fenced-in chicken yard, a shed for the milk cows, and an aviary open to the four winds so 
that wanderi ng birds could roost th ere at thei r pleasure. Followed by dozens of masons and  
carpenters, a s if she had contracted h er husband’ s hallucinating fever, Úrsula fixed the position of 
light and heat and distributed space without the least sense of its limitations. The primitive building 
of the founders became f illed with tools and mate rials, of workmen exhaus ted by sweat,  who asked 
everybody please not to molest them, exaspera ted by the sack of bones that followed the m 
everywhere with its dull rattle. In that discomfort , breathing quicklime and tar, no one could see very 
well how fro m the bowel s of the earth there was ri sing not only the largest house is th e town, but 
the most hos pitable and cool house that had ev er existed in the region of the swamp. Jos é Buendía, 
trying to su rprise Divine Providence in the midst of the cataclys m, was the on e who least 
understood it. The new house was almost finish ed when Úrsula drew him out of his chimerical 
world in order to inform him that sh e had an orde r to paint the front blue and not white a s they had  
wanted. She showed him the official document. José Arcadio Buendía, without understanding wha t 
his wife was talking about, deciphered the signature. 
“Who is this fellow?” he asked: 
“The magistrate,” Úrsula answered  disconsolatel y. They say he’s an authority sent by the 
government.” 
Don Apolinar Moscote, the magistrate, had arrive d in Macondo very quietly. He put up at the 
Hotel Jacob —built by one of the first Arabs wh o came to s wap knickknacks for macaws—and o n 
the following day he rented a small  room with a door on the street two blocks away from the 
Buendía house. He set u p a table and  a chair that he had bought from Jacob, nailed up on the wal l 
the shield of the republic that  he had brought with him, and  on the door he painted  the sign: 
Magistrate . His first order was for all the houses to  be painted blue in celeb ration of the anniversary 
of national independence. José Arcadio Buendía, wi th the copy of the or der in his hand, found him 
taking his nap in a hammock he had set up in the narrow office. “Did y ou write this paper?” he 
asked him. Don Apolinar Moscote,  a mature ma n, timid, with a ruddy complexion, said yes. “By 
what right?” José Arcadio  Buendía ask ed again. Do n Apolinar Moscote picked up a paper from the 
drawer of the table and  showed it to him. “I have been na med magistrate of this town.” Jos é 
Arcadio Buendía did not even  look at the appointment. 
“In this town we do not give orders with pieces  of paper,” he said without losing his calm. “And 
so that you  know it once and  for all, we don’t need an y judge here becau se there’s  nothing that 
needs judging.” 
Facing Don Apolinar Moscote, still without raisin g his voice, h e gave a detailed account of how 
they had founded the village, of h ow they had distributed the land,  opened the roads, and 
introduced the improvements that n ecessity requ ired without having bothered the government and  
without anyone having bothered them. “We are so peaceful that none of  us has died even of a  
natural death,” he said. “You can s ee that we st ill don’t have any cemetery. ” No once was upset that  
the government had no t helped them. On the contra ry, they were happy th at up until then it had let 
them grow i n peace, and  he hoped that it would c ontinue leaving them that way, because they had  
 33GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
not founded a town so that the first upstart who came alon g would tell them what to do. Do n 
Apolinar had put on his denim jacket, white like hi s trousers, without losing at any moment the 
elegance of his gestures. 
“So that if you want to stay here lik e any oth er ordinary citizen, you’re quite welco me,” José 
Arcadio Buendía concluded. “But if you’ve come to  cause disor der by makin g the people paint their  
houses blue, you can pick up your junk and go back where you came from. Because my house is 
going to be white, white,  like a dove.” 
Don Apolin ar Moscote turned pale. He took a step backward  and tighten ed his jaws a s he said 
with a certain affliction: 
“I must warn you that I’ m armed.” 
José Arcadio Buendía did not know exactly when his hands regained the useful strength with  
which he used to pull down horses. He grabbed D on Apolinar Moscote by the lapels  and lifted him 
up to the lev el of his eyes. 
“I’m doing this,” he said, “because I would rather  carry you ar ound alive a nd not have to keep  
carrying you around dead for the rest of my life.” 
In that way he carried hi m through the middle of  the street, s uspended by the lap els, until he put 
him down on his two feet on the swamp road. A week later  he was back with six barefoot and  
ragged soldiers, armed with shotguns, and an oxcart in which his wife and seven d aughters wer e 
traveling. Two other carts arrived later with the furniture, the baggage, and the household utensils.  
He settled hi s family in the Hotel Jacob, while he looked for a house, and he went ba ck to open hi s 
office under the protection of the soldiers. The founders of Macondo, resolving to expel the 
invaders, went with their older sons to put themselv es at the disposal of José Arcadio Buendía. But 
he was  against it, as  he explained, because it was not manly to make trouble f or someone in front of  
his family, and Don Apo linar had returned with his wife and daughters. So he decided to resolve the 
situation in a  pleasant wa y. 
Aureliano went with hi m. About th at time h e had begun to  cultivate th e black mustache with  
waxed tips and the somewhat stentor ian voice th at would characterize hi m in the war. Unarmed, 
without payi ng any atten tion to the guards, they went into the magistrate’s office. Don Apolinar 
Moscote did not lose his calm. He introduced them to two of his daughters who happened to be 
there: Amparo, sixteen, dark like her mother, and Remedios,  only nine, a pretty little girl with lily-
colored skin and green eyes. They were gracious and well-mannered. As so on as the m en came in, 
before being introduced, they gave them chairs to s it on. But they both rema ined standin g. 
“Very well, my friend,” José Arcadio Buendía sa id, “you may stay here, n ot because you have 
those bandits with shotguns at the door, but out of consideration for your wife and daughters.” 
Don Apolinar Moscote was upset, but José Arcadi o Buendía did not give him time to reply. “We 
only make two conditions,” he went on. “The first:  that everyone can p aint his house the color h e 
feels like. The second: that the soldiers leave at once. We will guaran tee order for you.” The 
magistrate ra ised his right hand with al l the fingers extended. 
“Your word of honor?” 
“The word of your enemy,” José Arcadio Buendía said. And he added in a bitter tone: “Because I  
must tell you one thing: you and I are still enemies.” 
The soldiers left that s ame afternoo n. A few da ys later José Arcadio Buendía found a house for 
the magis trate’s family. Everybody was at peac e except Au reliano. The image of Remedios, th e 
magistrate’s younger dau ghter, who, because of h er age, could  have b een h is daughter, kept paining 
him in some part of his body. It was a physical se nsation that al most bother ed him when he walked,  
like a pebble in his shoe.

THE  NEW H OUSE, white, like a dove, was inaugurated with a dance. Úrsula had got that idea from 
the afternoon when she saw Rebeca and Amaranta ch anged into adolescents, and it c ould almost 
have been said that the main reason behind the construction was a desire to have a proper place for 
the girls to receive visitors. In order that nothing  would be la cking in splendor she worked like a 
galley slave a s the rep airs were under way, so that before they were finished she had  ordered costl y 
necessities for the decorations, the ta ble service, and the marvelous invention that was to arouse the 
astonishmen t of the town and the jubilation of the young people: the pianola. They delivered it 
broken down, packed in several boxes that were un loaded al ong with th e Viennes e furniture, the 
Bohemian crystal, the tab le service from the In dies Company, the tablecloths from Holla nd, and a 
rich variety of lamps and candlesticks, hangings an d drapes. The import house sent alon g at its own  
expense an I talian expert,  Pietro Crespi, to assemble  and tune the pianola, to instruct th e purchasers 
in its functioning, and to teach them h ow to dance the lates t music printed on its six paper rolls. 
Pietro Crespi was young and blond, the most han dsome and well manner ed man who  had ever 
been seen in Macondo, so scrupulous in his dress that in spite of the suffocating heat he would work 
in his brocade vest and heavy coat of dark cloth. Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from  
the owners of the house, he spent several weeks shut up is the parlor with a dedication much like 
that of Aureliano in his silverwork. O ne morning,  without opening the door, without calling anyone 
to witness th e miracle, he placed the first roll in  the pianola and the tormenti ng hammering and the 
constant noi se of wooden lathings ceased in a sile nce that was  startled at the order and neatness of  
the music. T hey all ran to  the parlor. José Arcadio Buendía was  as if struck by lightning, not becaus e 
of the beauty of the melody, but beca use of the auto matic wor king of the keys of the pianola, and he 
set up Melquíades’ camera with the hope of getting a daguerreotype of the invisible play er. That day 
the Italian h ad lunch with them. Reb eca and Am aranta, serving the table, were intimidated by the  
way in which the angelic man with pale and ringless hands manipulated the utensils. In the living 
room, next to the parlor, Pietro Crespi taught them how to  dance. H e showed th em the s teps 
without touching them, keeping time with a m etronome, under the friendly eye of Úrsula, who did  
not leave th e room for a moment wh ile her daughters had th eir lesson. Pietro Crespi wore special  
pants on those days, very elastic and tight, and dancing slippers, “You don’t have to worry so 
much,” José Arcadio Buendía told her . “The man’ s a fairy.” But she did not leave off her vigilance 
until the ap prenticeship  was over a nd the Italia n left Macondo. Then they began to organize the 
party. Úrsula drew up a s trict guest list, in whic h the only ones  invited were the descend ants of the 
founders, except for th e family of Pilar Terner a, who by then had  had two more children by 
unknown fathers. It wa s truly a hi gh-class list, except that it was d etermined by feelings of  
friendship, for those favored were not only the o ldest friends of José Arcadio Buendía’s house since 
before they undertook th e exodus and  the founding of Macondo, but also their sons and grandsons, 
who were the constant companions of Aureliano an d Arcadi o since infa ncy, and th eir daughters, 
who were the only o nes who visited the house to  embroider with R ebeca and Am aranta. Don  
Apolinar Moscote, the benevolent ruler whose activity had been reduced to the mainten ance from 
his scanty resources of two policemen armed with wooden clubs, was a figurehead. In older to  
support the household expenses his daughters had opened a sewing shop, where they made felt 
flowers as well as guava delicacies, an d wrote love notes to order. But in spite of being modest and  
hard-workin g, the most beautiful girls in Iowa, an d the most skilled at the new dances, they did not 
manage to b e considered for the party. 
 35GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
While Úrsula and th e girls unpacked fu rniture, po lished silverware, and hung pictures of maidens  
in boats full of roses, which gave a br eath of ne w life to the na ked areas th at the mason s had built, 
José Arcadio Buendía stopped his pursuit of the image of God, convinced  of His nonexistence, and  
he took the pianola apart in order to decipher its magical secret. Two days before the party,  
swamped in a shower of leftover keys and hammers , bungling in the midst of a mix-up of strings 
that would u nroll in one direction and  roll up again in the oth er, he succeeded in a fashion in putting  
the instrument back together. There h ad never been as many su rprises and as much dashi ng about as 
in those da ys, but the new pitch la mps were lighted on the desi gnated day a nd hour. The house was 
opened, still smelling of resin and d amp whitewash, and the children and grandchild ren of the 
founders saw the porch  with ferns and begonias, the quiet rooms, the garden saturated with th e 
fragrance of the roses, an d they gath ered together in the parlor, facing the unknown invention that 
had been covered with a white sheet. Those who were familiar wi th the piano, popular in other  
towns in the swamp, felt a little disheartened, bu t more bitter was Úrsula’s disappointment when sh e 
put in the first roll so that Amaran ta and Rebeca  could begin the dancing and the mechanism did 
not work. Melquíades, almost blind by then, crumbling with decrepitud e, used the arts of his 
timeless wis dom in an attempt to fix it. Finally José Arcadio B uendía managed, by mistake, to move  
a device that was stu ck and the music cam e out, fi rst in a burst and th en in a flow o f mixed-up  
notes. Beatin g against the strings that had been pu t in without order or concert and had  been tuned  
with temerity, the hammers let go. But the stu bborn descendants of the twenty-one in trepid people 
who plowed through the mountains in search of th e sea to th e west avoided  the reefs of the melodic 
mix-up and the dancing went on until dawn. 
Pietro Crespi came back to repair the pianola. Rebeca and Amaranta help ed him put the strings  
in order and helped him with their la ughter at the mix-up of the melodies.  It was extremely pleasan t 
and so chaste in its way that Úrsula ceased her v igilance. On the eve of his departure a farewell  
dance for him was impr ovised with the pianola and with Rebeca he put on a skillful demonstration  
of modern dance, Arcadio and Amar anta matched them in grace and skill. But the exhibition was 
interrupted because Pilar Ternera, wh o was at the door with the onlookers, had a fight, biting and 
hair pulling, with a woman who had dared to comm ent that Ar cadio had a woman’s behind. Toward 
midnight Pietro Crespi took his leave with a se ntimental littl e speech, an d he promised to return  
very soon. Rebeca accompanied him to the door, and having closed up the house and put out the 
lamps, she went to h er room to wee p. It was  an inconsolable weeping tha t lasted  for s everal days,  
the caus e of which was  not known even by Am aranta. Her hermetism was not odd. Although she 
seemed expa nsive and cordial, she had a solitary character an d an impenetrable heart.  She was a  
splendid adolescent with long and firm bones, but she still insisted on using the small wooden 
rocking chair with which she had arrived at the house, reinforced many times and with the arms 
gone. No on e had discovered that even at that ag e she still had the habit of sucking her finger. That 
was why she would not lose an opportunity to lock  herself in the bathroom and had acquired the 
habit of sleeping with her face to the wall. On  rainy afternoons, embroidering with a group of 
friends on the begonia porch, she would lose the th read of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia 
would salt her palate when she saw the strips of damp earth and the piles of mud that th e 
earthworms had pushed up in the garden. Those s ecret tastes, defeated in the past by oranges and  
rhubarb, broke out into an irrepressible urge wh en she bega n to weep. She went b ack to ea ting 
earth. The first time she did it almost out of curios ity, sure tha t the bad taste would be the best cure 
for the tem ptation. And , in fact, she could not b ear the earth  in her mou th. But she persevered , 
overcome by the growing anxiety, and  little by littl e she was  getting back her ancestral a ppetite, th e 
taste of primary minerals, the unbridled satisfacti on of what was the original food. She would put 
handfuls of earth in her pockets, and  ate them in  small bits without bein g seen, with a confused 
feeling of pleasure and r age, as she i nstructed her gi rl friends in the most difficult needlepoint and  
 36GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
spoke about other men, who did not deserve the sa crifice of having one eat the whitewash on the 
walls becaus e of them. The handfuls of earth ma de th e only man wh o deserved that sho w of 
degradation less remote and more certain, as if the ground that he walked on with his fine patent 
leather boots  in another part of  the world were transmitting to her th e weight and th e temperature 
of his blood in a mineral  savor that l eft a harsh aftertaste in h er mouth an d a sediment of peace in  
her heart. One afternoon, for no re ason, Amparo  Moscote asked permission to see the house. 
Amaranta  and Rebeca, dis concerted b y the unexpected visit, attended her with a stiff formality. They 
showed her the remodeled mansion, they had her l isten to th e rolls on the p ianola, and they offered 
her orange marmalade and crackers. Amparo gave a lesson in dignity, pe rsonal charm, and good 
manners that impressed Úrsula in the few momen ts that she was present d uring the visit. After two  
hours, when the conv ersation was beginning to wane, Amparo took advantage of Amaranta’s  
distraction a nd gave Rebeca a letter. She was able to see the n ame of the Estimable Señorita Rebeca 
Buendía, written in the same method ical hand, wi th the same green ink, and the same delicacy of 
words with which the instructions for the operation of the pianola were written, and she folded the 
letter with the tips of her fingers and hid it in  her bosom, looking at A mparo Moscote with an  
expression of endless and unconditional gratitude and a silent promise of complicity unto death. 
The sudden friendship between Amp aro Moscote and Rebeca Buendía awakened the hopes of 
Aureliano. The memory of little Remedios had not stopped tor menting him, but he had not found a 
chance to see her. When he would stroll through town  with his closest friends, Magnífico Visbal and  
Gerineldo Márquez—the sons of the founders of the same n ames—he would look for her in the 
sewing shop with an anxious glance, but he saw only the ol der sisters. The presence of Ampar o 
Moscote in the house was like a premonition. “She has to come with her,” Aureliano would say to 
himself in a low voice. “She has to come.” He re peated i t so many tim es and with such conviction  
that one afternoon when he was putting together a little gold fish in the  work shop, he had the 
certainty tha t she had answered his call. Indeed, a short time later he heard the childish voice, and 
when he loo ked up his heart froze with terror as he saw the girl at the door, dressed in pink organdy 
and wearing white boots.  
“You can’t go in there, Remedios, Amparo Moscote said from the hall. They’re working.” 
But Aureliano did not gi ve her ti me to respond. He picked u p the little fish by the chain that 
came throug h its mouth and said to her. 
“Come in.” 
Remedios went over and asked some questions about the fish that Aureliano could not answer  
because he was seized with a sudde n attack of  asthma.  He wanted to stay beside that lily skin 
forever, beside those emerald eyes, close to that voice that called him “sir” with every question. 
showing the same respect that she gav e her father. Melquíades was in the corner seated at the d esk 
scribbling indecipherable signs. Aureliano hated hi m. All he could do was tell Remedios that he was  
going to give  her the little fish and the girl was so s tartled by the offer that s he left the workshop as  
fast as she could. That afternoon Aureliano lost the hidden patience with which he had waited for a 
chance to see her. He ne glected his work. In  severa l desperate efforts of co ncentration he willed her 
to appear bu t Remedios did not respond. He looked for her in her sisters’ shop, behind the window 
shades in her house, in her father’s office, but he found her only in the image that saturated his  
private and terrible solitude. He woul d spend who le hours with Rebeca in the parlor listening to the 
music on the pianola. She was listenin g to it because  it was the music with which Pietro Crespi ha d 
taught them how to dance. Aureliano listened to it simply becau se everything, even music, reminded 
him of Remedios. 
The house became full of loves Aureliano expresse d it in poetry that had no beginning or end. 
He would write it on the harsh pieces of parchment tha t Melquíades gave him, on the bathroo m 
walls, on the skin of h is arms, and in a ll of it Remedios would appear transfigured: Remedios in the 
 37GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
soporific air of two in t he afternoon, Remedios in the soft breath of the roses, Remedios in the 
water-clock secrets of the moths, Remedios in the steaming morning bread, Remedios everywhere 
and Remedi os forever. Rebeca waited for her love  at four in the afternoon, embroidering by the  
window. She knew that the mailman’s mule arrived only every two weeks, but she always waited for 
him, convinced that he was goin g to arrive on some other day by mistake. It happened quite the 
opposite: once the mule did not come on the usu al day. Mad  with desperation, Rebeca got up in the 
middle of the night and ate handfuls of earth in th e garden with a suicidal drive, weeping with pai n 
and fury, chewing tender earthworms and chipping her teeth on  snail shells. She vomited until dawn. 
She fell into a state of feverish prostration, lost  consciousness, and her hear t went into a  shameless 
delirium. Úrsula, scandalized, forced the lock on he r trunk and found at the bottom, tied together  
with pink ribbons, the sixteen perfumed letters and th e skeletons of leaves and p etals preserved in  
old books and the dried butterflies that turned to p owder at th e touch. 
Aureliano was the only one capable of understa nding such desolation. That afternoon, while 
Úrsula was trying to rescue Rebeca from the slough  of delirium , he went with Magnífico Visbal and 
Gerineldo Márquez to Catarino’s store. The estab lishment had been ex panded with  a gallery of 
wooden rooms where single women who smelled of dead flowers lived. A group made up of an 
accordion an d drums played th e songs of Francisc o the Man, who had not been s een i n Macond o 
for several years. The three friends drank ferm ented can e juice. Ma gnífico and Gerineldo, 
contemporar ies of Aureliano but mor e skilled in the wa ys of the world, drank methodically with the 
women s eated on their l aps. One of the women,  withered  and with gold work on her  teeth, gave 
Aureliano a caress tha t made him  shudder. He rej ected h er. He had  discovered tha t the more h e 
drank the m ore he thoug ht about Remedios, but he could bea r the torture of  his recollections better. 
He did not know exactly when he began to float. He saw his friends and  the women sailing in a 
radiant glow, without weight or mass, saying wo rds that did not come o ut of their mouths an d 
making mysterious signals that did not correspond to their expressions. Catarino put a hand on his 
shoulder and said to hi m: “It’s going on eleven.” Aureliano turned his  head, saw the enormou s 
disfigured face with a  felt flower behi nd the ear, a nd then  he lost his m emory, as during the tim es of 
forgetfulness, and he recovered it on a strange da wn and in a room that was completely foreign, 
where Pilar Ternera stood in her slip, barefoot, he r hair down, holding a  lamp over him, startled 
with disbelief. 
“Aureliano!” 
Aureliano checked his feet and raised his head. He  did not know how he had come ther e, but he 
knew what h is aim was, because he ha d carried it hidden since infancy in an inviolable backwater of 
his heart. 
“I’ve come to sleep with you,” he said. 
His clothes were smeared with mud and vomit. Pila r Ternera, who lived alone at that ti me with 
her two you nger children, did not as k him any q uestions. She took him to  the bed. Sh e cleaned  his 
face with a damp cloth,  took of his clothes, and then got completely u ndressed an d lowered the 
mosquito netting so that her children would not see them if they woke up. She had become tired of 
waiting for the man who would stay, of the men who left, of the countless men who missed the road 
to her house, confused by the uncertainty of the cards. During the wait her skin had becom e 
wrinkled, her breasts had withered, the coals of her heart had gone out. She f elt for Aureliano in the 
darkness, put her hand on his stomach and kissed him on th e neck with  a maternal tenderness. “My 
poor child,” she murmured. Aureliano shuddered. With  a calm skill, without the slightest misstep, he 
left his accumulated grief behind and found Remedios changed into a swamp without horizons, 
smelling of a  raw animal and recently ironed clothe s. When he came to the surface he was weeping.  
First they were involuntary and broken sobs. Then he emptied himself out in an unleashed flow, 
feeling that something swollen and painful had burs t inside of him. She waited, snatchin g his head 
 38GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
with the tips  of her fingers, until his body got ri d of the dark material that would not let him live. 
They Pilar Ternera asked him: “Who is it?” And Aure liano told her. She let out a laugh that in other  
times frightened the doves and that no w did not even  wake up the children. “You’ll have to raise her 
first,” she mocked, but underneath  the mocker y Aureliano found a reservoir of u nderstanding.  
When he went out of the room, leaving behind no t only his doubts about his virility but also th e 
bitter weight that his heart had borne for so many months, Pilar Ternera made him a spontaneous  
promise. 
“I’m going to talk to the girl,” she told him,  “and you’ll see wh at I’ll serve her on the tra y.” 
She kept her  promise. But it was  a bad moment, because the h ouse had los t its pea ce of  former  
days. When she discovered Rebeca’s passion, whic h was impo ssible to keep secret because of her  
shouts, Ama ranta suffered an attack o f fever. She al so suffered from the barb of a lonely love. Shut  
up in the bathroom, she would release herself from the tor ment of a hopeless passion by writing 
feverish letters, which sh e finally hid in the bo ttom of her tru nk. Úrsula barely had the strength to  
take care of  the two  sick girls. She was unable , after prolonged and insi dious interrogations, to 
ascertain the causes of Amaranta’s pr ostration. Fina lly, in another moment of inspiration, she force d 
the lock on the trunk and found the letters tied with a pink ribb on, swollen with fresh lilies and still 
wet with tears, addressed and never sent to Pietro Crespi. Weeping with rage, she cursed the day tha t 
it had occurred to her to buy the pianola, and she forbade the embroidery lessons and decreed a  
kind of mourning with no one dead which was  to be prolon ged until the daughters got over their  
hopes. Useless was the intervention of José Arcadi o Buendía, who had modified his first impression 
of Pietro Cre spi and admired his ability in the mani pulation of musical machines. So that when Pilar 
Ternera told Aureliano that Remedi os had decided on marriage, he could s ee th at the n ews would 
only give his parents more trouble. Invited to the parlor for a formal interview, José Arcadi o 
Buendía and Úrsula liste ned stonily to their son’s declaration. When he learned the name of the 
fiancée, however, José Arcadio B uendía grew red with i ndignation. “Love is a disease,” he 
thundered. “With so many pretty and decent girls around , the only thing that occurs to you is to get 
married to the daughter of our enemy.” But Úr sula agreed with the choice. She confessed her  
affection for the seven Moscote sisters. for their beauty, thei r ability for work, their modesty, and 
their good manners, and she celebrated her son’s prudence. Conquered by his wife’s enthusiasm, 
José Arcadio Buendía then laid down one condition: Rebeca, who was the one he wanted, would 
marry Pietro Crespi. Úrsula would take Amaranta  on a trip to the capital of the province when she 
had time, so  that con tact with different people wo uld alleviate her disappointment. Rebeca got her  
health back just as soon as she heard of the agreem ent, and she wrote her fiancé a jubilant letter tha t 
she submitted to her parents’ approval and put into  the mail without the use of any intermediaries. 
Amaranta  pretended  to accept the decision and little by little s he recovered  from her fevers, but she  
promised herself that Rebeca would marry only over her dead body. 
The following Saturday José Arcadio Buendía put on his dark suit, his celluloid collar, and th e 
deerskin boots that he had worn for the first time  the night of the party, and went to ask for the 
hand of Remedios Moscote. The m agistrate and  his wife received him, pleased and worried at the 
same tim e, for they did n ot know the reason for th e unexpected visit, and then they th ought that he 
was confused about the name of the intended bride.  In order to remove the mistake, the mother  
woke Remedios up and carried her into the living room, still drowsy fr om sleep. They asked her if it 
was true th at she had decided to get married, an d she answered, whimpering, that she only wanted  
them to let her sleep. José Arcadio Buendía, unde rstanding the distress of the Moscotes, went to 
clear things up with Aureliano. When he returned , the Moscotes had  put on formal clothing, had  
rearranged the furniture and put fresh flowers in th e vases, an d were waiti ng in the co mpany of th eir 
older daughters. Overwhelmed by th e unpleasa ntness of the occasion and the bothersome hard 
collar, José Arcadio Buendía confirmed the fact that Remedios, indeed, was the ch osen one. “It 
 39GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
doesn’t make sense,” Don Apolinar Moscote said wi th consternation. “We have six other daughters , 
all unmarried, and at an age where they deserve it, who would be delighted to be the ho norable wife 
of a gentlem an as serious  and hard-working as yo ur son, and Aurelito lays  his eyes  precisely on the 
one who still wets her bed.” His wife, a well-preser ved woman with afflicted eyelids and  expression, 
scolded his mistake. When they finished the fr uit punch, they willingly accepted Aureliano’s 
decision. Except that Señora Moscote begged the fa vor o f speaking to  Úrsula  alone. Intrigued, 
protesting that they were involving her in men’s affa irs, but really feeling deep emotion, Úrsula went 
to visit her the next day. A half hour later she returned with the news that Rem edios had not 
reached puberty. Aureliano did not consider that a serious barrier. He had waited so l ong that he 
could wait as  long as was necessary un til his bride reached the a ge of conception. 
The newfound harmony was interrupted by th e death of Melquíades. Although it was a 
foreseeable event, the circumstances were not. A fe w months after his return, a process of aging had 
taken place i n him that was so rapid and critical that soon he was treated  as one of those useless 
great-grandfathers who  wander abou t the bedroo ms like shad es, dragging their feet, remembering 
better times aloud, and whom no one bothers abou t or rememb ers really until the morning they find 
them d ead in their bed. At first José Arcadio Bue ndía helped him in his work, enthusiastic over th e 
novelty of the daguerreotypes and the predictions of Nostradamus. But little by little he began 
abandoning him to his s olitude, for communicati on was b ecoming Increasingly difficult. He wa s 
losing his sight and his hearing, he seemed to conf use the people he was speaking to with others he 
had known in remote epochs of mankind, and he would answer questions with a complex 
hodgepodge of languages. He would  walk along gr oping in the air, al though he pass ed between  
objects with an inexplicable fluidity, as if be wer e endowed with  some instinct of direction based on  
an immedia te prescience.  One day he forgot to put in  his false teeth, whi ch at night h e left in a glass 
of water beside his bed, and he never put them in again. When Úr sula undertook the enla rgement of 
the house,  she had them build him a special room next to Aur eliano’s workshop, far from the noise  
and bustle of the house, with a window flooded wi th light and a bookcase where she herself put in 
order the books that were almost destroyed by dust and moths, the flaky stacks of paper covered 
with indecip herable signs, and th e glass with his false teeth, where som e aquatic pla nts with  tiny 
yellow flowers had taken  root. The n ew place seemed to pl ease Melquíades, because h e was n ever 
seen any more, not even in the dining room, He only went to Aureliano’s workshop, where he 
would spend hours on end scribbling his enigmatic literature on  the parchm ents that h e had brought 
with him and that seemed to have been made out of  some dry material that crumpled like puff paste. 
There he ate the meals that Visitación  brought him twi ce a da y, although in the last days he lost his 
appetite and fed only on vegetables. He soon acquired th e forlorn look tha t one sees in vegetarians. 
His skin bec ame covered with a thin moss, similar to that which flourished on the antique vest tha t 
he never too k off, and his breath exh aled the odo r of a sleeping animal. Aureliano ended up forget-
ting about him, absorbed in the composition of his poems, but on one occasion he thought he 
understood something of what Melquíades was sa ying in his groping m onologues, a nd he paid  
attention. In  reality, the only thing that could be isolated in the rocky paragraphs was the insistent 
hammering on the wor d equinox, equinox, equino x, and the name of Al exander von Humboldt. 
Arcadio got a little closer to him  when he b egan to help Aureliano in his silverwork. Melquíades 
answered tha t effort at co mmunicatio n at times b y giving forth with phrases in Spanish that had  very 
little to do with reality. One afternoon, however, he  seemed to be illuminate d by a sudden emotion.  
Years later, facing the firing squad, Arcadio woul d remember the trembling with which Melquíades 
made him listen to several pages of his impenetrabl e writing, which of course he did not u nderstand,  
but which when read alo ud were like encyclicals b eing chanted . Then he sm iled for the first time in a  
long while and said in Spanish: “When I die, burn mercury in my room for  three d ays.” Arcadio told 
that to José Arcadio Buendía and the latter tried to  get more explicit information, but he received 
 40GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
only one answer: “I have found immortality.” When  Melquíades’ breathing began to smell, Arcadio 
took him to bathe in the river on Thursday mornings. He seemed to get b etter. He wo uld undress 
and get into the water with the boys, and his my sterious sense of orientation would allow him to 
avoid the deep and dang erous spots. “We come fr om the wa ter,” he said on a certai n occasion.  
Much time passed in that way without anyone’s seeing him in the house except on the night when  
he made a pathetic effort to fix the pianola, an d when he would go to the river with Arcadio,  
carrying under his arm a gourd and a bar of palm o il soap wrapped in a towel. One Thursday before 
they called h im to go to the river, Aureliano heard him say: “I have died of fever on the dunes of  
Singapore.” That da y he went into the wa ter at a bad spot and they did  not find hi m until the 
following day, a few miles downstrea m, washed u p on a bright bend in the river and with a solitary 
vulture sitting on his stomach. Ov er the scand alized protests of Úrsula, who wept with more grief 
than she had  had for her own father, J osé Arcadi o Buendía was  opposed to their burying him. “He 
is immortal,” he said, “an d he himself revealed the formula of his resurrection.” He brought out the 
forgotten water pipe and put a kettle of mercury to  boil next to the body, which little by little was  
filling with blue bubbles. Don Apolinar Moscote ventured to remind him that an unburied drowned 
man was a danger to public health. “None of t hat, because he’s alive,” was the an swer of José 
Arcadio Buendía, who finished the s eventy-two hou rs with the mercurial incense as the body was  
already beginning to burst with a livid fluorescen ce, the soft whistles of which impregnated the 
house with a pestilential vapor. Only then did he permit them  to bury him,  not in any o rdinary way,  
but with the honors reserved for Mac ondo’s greatest be nefactor. It was the first burial and the best-
attended  one that was  ever seen  in th e town,  only surpassed, a  century later, by Big Mama’s funeral  
carnival. They buried him  in a grave d ug in the center  of the p lot destined  for the cem etery, with  a 
stone on wh ich they wro te the only thing they knew about hi m: MELQUÍ ADES . They gave him his 
nine nights of wake. In the tumult that gathered in  the courtyar d to drink coffee, tell jokes, and play 
cards. Amaranta found a chance to confess her lo ve to Pietro Crespi, who a few weeks before ha d 
formalized his promise to Rebeca and had set up  a store for musical instruments and mechanical  
toys in the s ame section where the Arabs had lin gered in other times swapping knickknacks for 
macaws, and  which the p eople called  the Street of  the Turks. The Italian, whose head covered with  
patent leather curls aroused in women an irrepressibl e need to  sigh, dealt with Amara nta as with a  
capricious little girl who was not worth taking seriously. 
“I have a younger brother,” he told her. “He’s coming to help me in the store.” 
Amaranta felt humiliated and told Pietro Crespi wi th a virulent anger that she was prepared to 
stop her sister’s wedding even if her own dead bo dy had to li e across the door. The Italian was so 
impressed b y the dramatics of the th reat tha t he could not resist the tem ptation to mention it to 
Rebeca. Tha t was ho w Amaranta’s tri p, always put off by Úrsula’s work, wa s arranged in less than a 
week. Am aranta put up no resistance, but when  she kissed Rebeca good-bye she whisp ered in her  
ear: 
“Don’t get your hopes up. Even if they send me to the ends  of the earth I’ll find some way of  
stopping you from getting married, even if I have to kill you.” 
With the absence of Úrsula, with the invisible pr esence of Melquíades, who continued his stealth y 
shuffling through the rooms, the house seemed  enormous and empty. Rebeca took  charge of 
domestic order, while the Indian woma n took care of the bakery. At  dusk, when Pietro C respi would 
arrive, preceded by a co ol breath of lavender and always bringing a toy as a gift, his fiancée woul d 
receive the visitor in the main parlor with doors and windows open to be safe from any  suspicion. It  
was an unnecessary preca ution, for the Italian had s hown himself to be so respectful tha t he did no t 
even touch the hand of the woman  who was going to  be his wife within th e year. Thos e visits were 
filling the house with remarkable toys. Mechanic al ballerinas, music boxes, acrobatic monkeys, 
trotting horses, clowns who played the tambour ine: the rich and startling mechanica l fauna that 
 41GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Pietro Crespi brought dissipated José Arcadio Buendía ’s affliction over the death of Mel quíades and 
carried him back to  his o ld days as  an alchemist.  He lived at that tim e in a paradise of disemboweled 
animals, of mechanisms that had been taken apar t in an attempt to perfect them wi th a system of 
perpetual motion based  upon the principles of the pendulum.  Aureliano, for his part, had neglected  
the worksho p in order to teach  little Remedios to read and write. At first the child p referred her 
dolls to the man who would come  every afternoon and who was responsible for her bei ng separated  
from her toys in order to be bathed a nd dressed an d seated in the parlor to receive the visitor. But 
Aureliano’s patience and  devotion finally won her over, up to the point where she would spend 
many hours with him studying the meaning of the letters and sketching in a  notebook with colored 
pencils little houses with cows in the corral and rou nd suns with yellow rays that hid behind the hills. 
Only Rebeca was unhap py, because of Amaranta ’s threat. She knew her sister’s character, th e 
haughtiness of her sp irit, and she was frightened by the virulence of her anger. She would spend 
whole hours sucking her finger in the bathroom, ho lding herself back with an exhausting iron will so 
as not to eat earth. In search of some relief for her uncertainty, she called Pilar Ternera to read her  
future. After a string of conventiona l vagaries, Pilar Ternera predicted: 
“You will not be happy as long as  your parents remain unburied.” 
Rebeca  shud dered. As in  the memor y of a  drea m she s aw herself entering the hous e as a ver y 
small girl, with the trunk and the little rocker, an d a bag whose contents she had never known. She 
remembered a bald gentleman dressed in linen an d with his collar closed by a gold butt on, who had 
nothing to do with the k ing of hearts. She re mem bered a very young and beautiful woman with  
warm and perfumed hands, who had nothing in  common with the ja ck of diamonds and his  
rheumatic hands, and who used to pu t flowers in he r hair and take her out walking in the afternoon 
through a town with green streets. 
“I don’t understand,” she said. 
Pilar Ternera seemed disconcerted: 
“I don’t either, but that’s what th e cards say.” 
Rebeca was so preoccupi ed with the enigma that  she told it to José Arcadio Buendía, and he 
scolded her for believing in the predictions of th e cards, but he undertook the silent task of 
searching closets and tr unks, moving furniture and turning over beds an d floorboards looking for 
the bag of bones. He r emembered  that he had not seen i t since the ti me of the r ebuilding. He 
secretly sum moned the masons and one of them revealed that he had wal led up the bag in some 
bedroom because it bothered him in his work. After se veral d ays of listening, with their ears against 
the walls, th ey perceived the d eep cloc-cloc . They penetrated  the wall and ther e were the b ones in th e 
intact bag. T hey buried it the sam e day in a grave without a s tone next to  that of Melq uíades, and 
José Arcadi o Buendía r eturned ho me free of a burden that for a moment had weighed on his 
conscience a s much as  the memory of Prudenci o Aguilar. When he went through the kitchen  he 
kissed Rebeca on the forehead. 
“Get those bad thoughts out of your head,” he told her. “You’re going to be happy.” 
The friendship with Rebeca opened  up to Pilar Ternera the do ors of the house, closed by Úrsula 
since the birth of Arcadio. She would arrive at an y hour of the day, like a flock of goats, and would  
unleash her feverish energy in the ha rdest task s. Sometimes she would go into the workshop and  
help Arcadio  sensitize th e daguerreotype plates with  an efficiency and a  tenderness that ended up b y 
confusing him. That woman bothered him. The tan of  her skin, her smell of smoke, the disorder of 
her laughter in the darkroom distracted his attentio n and made him bump into things. 
On a certain  occasion Aureliano was  there worki ng on his silver, and Pilar Ternera lea ned over 
the table to admire his la borious patience. Suddenl y it happened. Aureliano made sure that Arcadio 
was in the d arkroom before raising his eyes and m eeting those of Pilar Tern era, whose thought was 
perfectly visible, as if exposed to the li ght of noon. 
 42GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“Well,” Aure liano said. “Tell me what it is.” 
Pilar Ternera  bit her lips with a sad smile. 
“That you’d be good in a war,” she said. “ Where you put your eye, you put your bullet.” 
Aureliano relaxed with the proof of the omen. He  went back  to concentr ate on his work as if 
nothing had happened, and his voice took on a restful strength. 
“I will recognize him,” he said. “He’ll bear my name.” 
José Arcadio Buendía finally got what he was l ooking for: he connected the mechanis m of the 
clock to a m echanical bal lerina, and the toy danced uninterrupted ly to the rhythm of her own music 
for three days. That d iscovery excited him m uch more than any of  his other harebrained 
undertakings. He stopped eating. He stopped  sleeping . Only the vigilance and care of  Rebeca kept  
him from being dragged off by his i magination in to a s tate of perpetual  delirium from which he 
would not recover. He would spend the nights wa lking around the room thinking aloud, searching 
for a way to  apply th e principles of the pendulu m to oxcarts , to harrows, to everything that wa s 
useful when put into motion. The fever of insomnia fatigued him so much that one dawn he could 
not recognize the old man with white hair and un certain gestures who came into his bedroom. It 
was Prudencio Aguilar. When he finally identified him,  startled that the dead also aged, José Arcadio 
Buendía felt himself shaken by nos talgia. “Prudencio ,” he exclaimed. “You’ve come from a long wa y 
off!” After many years of death the yearning for the living was so intense, the need  for company so  
pressing, so terrifying the neatn ess of that oth er death whi ch exists withi n death, th at Prudencio 
Aguilar had ended up lov ing his worst enemy. H e had spent a  great deal of time looking for him. He 
asked the dead from Riohacha abou t him, the de ad who ca me from the Upar Valley, those who  
came from the swamp, and no one could tell him because Macondo was a town that was unknown  
to the d ead until Melquíades arrived and marked it with a sm all black dot on the m otley maps of  
death. José Arcadio Buendía conversed with Prud encio Aguilar until dawn. A few hours later, worn 
out by the vigil, he went into Aurelian o’s workshop and asked him: “What day is today? ” Aureliano 
told him tha t it was Tuesday. “I was thinking th e same thing,” José Arc adio Buendía said, “but 
suddenly I realized that it’ s still Monday, like yester day. Look at the sky, look  at the walls, look at the 
begonias. Today is Monday too.” Used to his manias, Aureliano paid no attention to hi m. On the 
next day, Wednesday, José Arcadio Bu endía went back  to the workshop. “This is a disaster,” he said.  
“Look at the air, listen to the buzzing of the sun, the same as yesterday and  the day b efore. Today is 
Monday too.” That night Pietro Crespi found hi m on the porch, weeping for Prudencio Aguilar, for 
Melquíades, for Rebeca’s parents, for his mother an d father, for all of those he could remember and  
who were now alone in death. He gave him a mechanical bear that walked on its hind legs on a  
tightrope, but he could not distract him from hi s obsession. He asked him what had  happened to 
the project h e had explai ned to him  a few days b efore about the possibility of building a pendu lum 
machine tha t would help men to fly and he answered that it was impossible because a pendulum  
could lift anything into the air but it could not lift itself. On Thursday he appeared in the workshop  
again with the painful look of plowed ground. “T he time machine has br oken,” he almost sobbed , 
“and Úrsula  and Amaranta so far away!” Aureliano scolded  him like a child and he adopted a 
contrite air. He spent six hours examining things, trying to find a difference from their appearance 
on the previous day in t he hope of discovering in th em some change that would reveal the passage 
of time. He  spent the whole night in bed wit h his eyes o pen, calling to Prudencio Aguilar, to 
Melquíades, to all the d ead, so that they would share his distress. But no one came. On Friday. 
before anyo ne arose, he watched  the appear ance of nature again until he did not have the slightest 
doubt but that it was Monday. Then he grabbed the bar from a door and with the sava ge violence of 
his uncom mon strength he smash ed to dust the equip ment in th e alchem y laboratory, the 
daguerreotype room, the silver workshop, shouting  like a man possessed in some high-sounding and 
fluent but completely in comprehensi ble language. He was abo ut to finish off the rest of the house 
 43GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
when Aureli ano asked th e neighbors for help. Te n men were needed to get him down, fourteen to  
tie him up,  twenty to  drag him to  the chestnu t tree in th e courtyard, wher e they left him tied  up, 
barking in the strange l anguage and  giving of f a green froth at the mouth. When Úrsula and 
Amaranta returned he was still tied to the trunk of  the chestnut tree by his hands and feet, soaked 
with rain an d in a sta te of total inn ocence. Th ey spoke to him and he looked at th em withou t 
recognizing them, saying things they did not understand. Úrsula untied his wrists and ankles, lacer-
ated by the pressure of the rope, and left him tied  only by the waist. Later on they built him a shelter 
of palm brandies to protect him from the sun and the rain.

Chapter 5 
AURELIA NO BUENDÍA and Remedios Moscote were married one Sunday in March before the altar 
Father Nicanor Reyna had set up in the parlor. It was the culmination of four  weeks of shocks in th e 
Moscote household beca use little Remedios had reache d puberty before getting over the habits of 
childhood. In spite of the fact that her mother had taught her about the changes of adolescence, on e 
February afternoon she burst shouting into the l iving room, where her si sters were chatting with 
Aureliano, and showed them her panties, smeared  with a chocolate-colored paste. A mo nth for th e 
wedding was agreed upon. There was barely enough  time to teach her how to wash herself, get 
dressed by h erself, and understand th e fundamental business o f a home. Th ey mad e her urinate over  
hot bricks in order to cure her of the habit of wetting her bed. It took a good deal of work to 
convince her  of the inviolability of the marital secret, for Remedios was so confused and at the sam e 
time so ama zed at the revelation tha t she wanted to talk to everybody about the details of the 
wedding night. It was a fatiguing effort, but on th e date set for the ceremo ny the child was as adep t 
in the ways of the world as any of her sisters. Don Apolinar Moscote escorted her by th e arm down  
the street th at was deco rated with flowers and wr eaths ami dst the explosion of rockets and the 
music of several bands, and she waved with her h and and gave her thanks with a smile to those who  
wished her good luck from the windows. Aure liano, dressed in black, wearing the same paten t 
leather boots with metal fasteners that he would  have on a f ew years later as he faced the firing 
squad, had an intense paleness and a hard lump in  his throat when he met the bride at the door o f 
the house and led her to the altar. She behaved as  naturally, with such discretion, that she did not 
lose her composure, not even when Aureliano dropped the ring as he tried to put it on her finger. In 
the midst of the. murmurs and confusion of the gu ests, she kept her arm with the fingerless lace 
glove held up and remained like that with her ri ng finger ready until the bridegroom managed to  
stop the ring with his foot before it rolled to th e door, and came b ack blushing to the altar. H er 
mother and sisters suffered so much from the fear  that the chi ld would do something wrong during 
the ceremon y that in the end they wer e the ones w ho committed the impertinence of picking her up 
to kiss her. From that d ay on the s ense of respo nsibility, the natural grace, the calm control that 
Remedios would have in  the face of adverse ci rcumstances  was revealed. It was  she who, on h er 
own initiativ e, put aside the largest pi ece that sh e had cut fro m the weddi ng cake and took it on a 
plate with a  fork to José Arcadio  Buendía. Tied  to the trunk of the chestnut tree, h uddled on a  
wooden stoo l underneath  the palm shelter, the enormous old man, discolored by the sun and rain, 
made a vague smile of gratitude and at the piece of  cake with his fingers , mumbling an unintelligible  
psalm. The only unhappy person in that noisy cel ebration, wh ich lasted  until dawn on  Monday, wa s 
Rebeca Buen día. It was her own frustrated party. B y an arrangement of Úrsula’s, her marriage was to 
be celebrated on the sa me day, but that Friday Pi etro Crespi received a letter with th e news of his 
mother’s imminent death. The wed ding was postponed. Pietro Crespi  left for the capital of the 
province an hour after receiving the letter, and on the road he missed his mother, who arrived 
punctually Saturday night and at Aurel iano’s wedding sang the sad aria that s he had prepa red for the 
wedding of her son. Pietro Crespi returned on Sund ay midnight to sweep up the ashes  of the party,  
after having worn out five horses on the road in an attemp t to be in time for his wedding. It was 
never discovered who wr ote the letter . Tormented  by Úrsula, Amaranta wept with indi gnation and 
swore her innocence in front of the altar, which the carpenters h ad not finished dismantling. 
Father Nicanor Reyna—whom Don Apolinar Moscote had brought from the swamp to  officiate 
at the wedding—was an old man h ardened by the ingr atitude of his ministry. His skin was sad, wit h 
the bones al most exposed, and he had a pronounced round stomach and the expression of an old 
 45GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
angel, which came more from, simplicity than fr om goodness. He had planned to return to his  
pariah after the wedding, but he was a ppalled at the hardness of the inhabitants of Macondo, who 
were prospering in the midst of sc andal, subject to th e natural law, witho ut baptizing their children  
or sanctifying their festivals. Thinking that no land  needed  the seed of God  so much, he decided to  
stay on for another week to Christianize both circu mcised and gentile, legalize concubinage, and give 
the sacramen ts to the dying. But no one paid an y attention to him. They would answer him that th ey 
had been many years without a prie st, arranging the business of thei r souls directly with God, and 
that th ey ha d lost the evi l of original sin. Tired of preaching in the open, Fa ther Nicanor  decided to  
undertake th e building of a church, the largest in th e world, with life-size saints and s tained-glass 
windows on  the sides, s o that peopl e would co me from R ome to  hon or God in the cen ter of 
impiety. He went everywhere begging alms with a copper dish. They gave him a large amount, but 
he wanted more, because the church had to have a bell that would raise the drowned up to the 
surface of the water. He pleaded so much that he lo st his voice. His bones began to fill with sounds. 
One Saturda y, not even having collected the price of  the doors, he fell into a desperate confusion. 
He improvised an altar in the square and on Sunday  he went through the town  with a small bell, as 
in the days of insomnia, calling people to an open-ai r mass. Many went out of curiosity. Others from 
nostalgia. Others so that God would not take th e disdain for His intermediary as a personal insult. 
So that at ei ght in the morning half the town was in the square, where Father Nicanor chanted the 
gospels in a voice that ha d been lacerated by his pleading. At the end, when the congregation began 
to break up, he raised his arms signaling for attention. 
“Just a moment,” he said. “Now we shall witness an undeniabl e proof of the infinite power of 
God.” 
The boy who had helped  him with the mass brough t him a cu p of thick and steaming chocolate,  
which he dra nk without p ausing to breathe. Then  he wiped his li ps with a handkerchief that he drew 
from his slee ve, extended  his arms, and closed his eyes. Thereu pon Father Nicanor rose six inches 
above the level of the ground. It was  a convincin g measure. He went am ong the hou ses for several 
days repea ting the demon stration of levitation by means of ch ocolate while the a colyte collected so  
much money in a bag th at in less tha n a month h e began the construction  of the church. No on e 
doubted the divine origin of the demo nstration ex cept José Arcadio Buendía, who without changing 
expression watched the troop of people who gather ed arou nd the ches tnut tree one morning to 
witness the revelation once more. He merely st retched on  his stool a little and shrugged his 
shoulders when Father Nicanor beg an to rise up fr om the ground along wi th the chair he was  sittin g 
on. 
“Hoc est simplicissimus ,” José Arcadio Bu endía said. “ Homo iste statum quartum materiae i nvenit.” 
Father Nica nor raised his hands and the four legs of the chai r all landed on the ground at the 
same time. “ Nego,” he said. “ Factum hoc existentiam Dei probat sine dubio .” 
Thus it was discovered that José Arcadio Buend ía’s devilish jargon was Latin. Father Nicanor  
took advantage of the circumstance of his being the only person who had been able to communicate 
with him to try to inject the faith into his twisted mind. Every afternoon he would sit by the 
chestnut tree preaching in Latin, but José Arcadi o Buendía insisted on rejecting rhetorical tricks and 
the transmutation of chocolate, and he demand ed the daguerreotype of God as the only proof. 
Father Nica nor then bro ught him medals and pictur es and even a reproduction of the Veronica, but 
José Arcadi o Buendía rejected them as artistic objects without any sci entific basis. He was so  
stubborn that Father Nicanor gave up his attempts  at evangelization and continued visiting him out 
of humanitarian feelings. But then it was José Ar cadio Buendía who took the lead and  tried to break  
down the priest’s faith with rationalist tricks. On  a certain occa sion when Father Nicano r brought a 
checker set to the chestn ut tree and invited him to  a game, José Arcadio Buendía would not accept, 
because according to him he could never understand the sense of a contest in which the two  
 46GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
adversaries have agreed upon the rules. Father Nicanor, who had never seen checkers played that 
way, could n ot play it again. Ever  more startled at J osé Arcadio Bue ndía’s lucidity, he ask ed him how 
it was possible that th ey had him tied to a tree. 
“Hoc est simplicissimus ,” he replied. “Because I’m Crazy.” 
From then on, concerned about his own faith, t he priest did not come back to visit him and  
dedicated hi mself to hurrying along t he building of  the church. Rebeca fel t her hopes being reborn. 
Her future was predicated  on the com pletion of th e work, for one Sunday when Father Nicanor was  
lunching at the house and the whol e family sitting at th e table spok e of the solemnity a nd splendor 
that religious ceremonies would acquire when the ch urch was built, Amaranta said: “The luckiest 
one will be Rebeca.” And since Rebeca did not unde rstand what she meant, she explained it to her  
with an inno cent smile: 
“You’re goin g to be the one who will inaugurate the church with your wedding.” 
Rebeca tried  to forestall any commen ts. The wa y the construction was going the church would 
not be built before another ten years. Father Nica nor did not agree: the growing generosity of the 
faithful permitted him to make mor e optimistic calculations. To the mute Indignation  of Rebeca, 
who could not finish her lunch, Úrsula celebrated  Amaranta’s idea and con tributed a co nsiderable 
sum for the work to move faster. Father Nicanor felt that with another contribution like that the 
church woul d be ready within three years. From  then on Rebeca did not say ano ther word to  
Amaranta, convinced tha t her initiative had not th e innocence that she attempted to give it. “That 
was th e leas t serious thin g I could ha ve done,” Amaranta ans wered her d uring the violent argumen t 
they had that night. “In that way I won’t have to kill you fo r three years.” Rebeca accepted the 
challenge. 
When Pietro Crespi found out about the new postponement, he went through a crisis of 
disappointment, but Rebeca gave him a final proof of her loyalty. “We’ll elope whenever you say,”  
she told him. Pietro Crespi, however, was not a ma n of adventure. He lacked the impulsive character  
of his fiancée and he considered respect for on e’s given word as a wealth that sh ould not be 
squandered. Then Rebeca turned to more audaci ous methods. A mysterious wind blew out the 
lamps in the parlor and Úrsula surprised the lovers kissing in t he dark. Pietro Crespi ga ve her some 
confused explanations about the poor quality of modern  pitch lamps and he even helped her install a 
more secure system of illumination for the room. But the fuel failed again or the wicks became 
clogged and Úrsula found Rebeca sitting on her fiancé’s lap. This time she would accept no  
explanation. She turned the responsibility of the bakery over to the Indian woman and sat in a 
rocking chair to watch over the young people during the visits, ready to win out over maneuvers that 
had already been old wh en she was a  girl. “Poor Ma ma,” Rebeca would sa y with mock  indignation, 
seeing Úrsula yawn during the boredom of the visits . “When she dies she’ll go off to her reward in 
that rocking chair.” After three mon ths of supervi sed love, fatigued by the slow progress of the 
construction,  which he went to inspect every day, Pi etro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the 
money he needed to finish the church. Amaranta di d not grow impatient. As  she conversed with her  
girl friends every afternoon when they came to em broider on the porch, s he tried to think of new 
subterfuges. A mistake in calculation spoiled the one she con sidered the most effecti ve: removing 
the mothball s that Rebeca had put in her wedding  dress before she put it away in the bedroom 
dresser. She did it when two months were left for the completi on of the ch urch. But Rebeca was so  
impatient wi th the approach of the wedding that she wanted to get the dress ready earlier than 
Amaranta  had foreseen. When she o pened the dr esser and un folded first the papers  and then  the 
protective cl oth, she found the fabric of the dress and the stitches of the veil and even the crown of  
orange blossoms perforated by moths. Although she was sure that she had put a handful of 
mothballs in  the wrappin gs, the disaster seemed  so natural th at she did  not dare bla me Amaran ta. 
There was less than a mo nth until the wedding, but Amparo M oscote prom ised to sew a  new dress 
 47GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
within a week. Amaranta felt faint that rainy noontime when Amparo came to the house wrapped in 
the froth of needlework for Rebeca to have the fi nal fitting of the dress. She lost her voice and a  
thread of cold sweat ran down the pa th of her spin e. For long months she had trembled with fright 
waiting for that hour, be cause if she had not been able to conceive the ultimate obsta cle to Rebeca’s 
wedding, she was sure th at at the last moment, wh en all the resources of her imagination had failed, 
she would have the courage to poison her. That afternoon, while Rebeca was suffocating with heat 
inside the armor of thread that Ampa ro Moscote was putting about her body with thousands of pins 
and infinite patience, Amaranta m ade several mistakes  in her crocheting and pricked her finger wit h 
the needle, b ut she decided with frightful coldness that the date would be the last Friday before the 
wedding and the meth od would be a d ose of laudanum in her coffee. 
A greater obstacle, as  impassable as it wa s unforeseen, obliged a new and indefinite 
postponement. One week before the date set for the wedding, little Remedi os woke up i n the middle 
of the night soaked in a hot broth which had ex ploded in her insides with a kind of tearing belch, 
and she died three days  later, poisoned by her own blood, with a pair of twins crossed in her 
stomach. Amarante suffered a crisis of conscience. She had begged God with such fervor for 
something fearful to happen so that she would not have to poison Rebeca that she felt guilty of 
Remedios’ death. That was not the obstacle th at she had begged for so much. Remedios had 
brought a breath of m erriment to th e house. She h ad settl ed do wn with her husband in a  room near  
the worksho p, which she decorated with the dolls  and toys of her recent childhood, and her merry  
vitality overflowed th e four walls of th e bedroom and went like a whirlwind of good health along the 
porch with the begonias: She would start singin g at da wn. S he was the only person  who dared  
intervene in the argumen ts between  Rebeca  and Am aranta.  She plunged i nto the fatiguing chore o f 
taking care of José Arca dio Buendía. She would bring him his food, she would help him with his  
daily necessities, wash him with soap and a scrubb ing brush, ke ep his hair and beard free of lice and  
nits, keep the palm shelter in good condition an d reinforce it with waterproof canvas in stormy 
weather. In her last months she had succeed ed in communicating with him in phrases of 
rudimentary Latin. When the son of Aureliano and Pilar Ternera was born an d brought to  the house 
and baptized in an intimate cerem ony with th e name Aur eliano José, Remedios decided that he 
would be considered their oldest child. Her maternal instinct surprised Úrsula. Aureliano, for his 
part, found in her the jus tification that he needed  to live. He worked all day in his workshop and 
Remedios would bring him a cup of black coffee in the middle of the morning. They would both  
visit the Moscotes every night. Aureliano would pl ay endless games of dominoes with his father-in-
law while Remedios chatted with her sisters or ta lked to her mother abou t more important things. 
The link with the Bu endías consolidated Don Apolinar Moscote’s authority in th e town. On  
frequent trips to th e cap ital of the p rovince he  succeeded  in getting the government to build a  
school so that Arcadio, who had inherited the ed ucational enthusiasm of his grandfather, could take 
charge of it. Through persuasion he managed to g et the majority of houses painted blue in time for 
the date of n ational indep endence. At the urging of Father Nica nor, he arranged for the transfer of 
Catarino’s store to a ba ck street an d he closed down several scandalous establishments tha t 
prospered in the cen ter of town. Once he returned with six policemen arm ed with rifles to whom he 
entrusted th e maintenan ce of order, and no on e remembered the original agreement not to  have  
armed men in the town. Aureliano enjoyed his father-i n-law’s efficiency. “You’re going to get as fat 
as he is,” his friends would say to him.  But his sedentary life, which accentuated his cheekbones and  
concentra ted the sparkle of his eyes , did not in crease his weight or alter the parsimony of his  
character, bu t, on the co ntrary, it hardened on his lips the straight line of solitary meditation and  
implacable d ecision. So deep was  the affection tha t he and  his wife had su cceeded  in a rousing in 
both their families that when Remedi os announced th at she was going to h ave a child. even Rebeca 
and Amaran ta decl ared a  truce in ord er to knit items in blue wool if it was to be a boy and in pink  
 48GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
wool in case it was  a girl. She was  the last pers on Arcadio tho ught about a  few years la ter when  he 
faced the firing squad. 
Úrsula ordered a mourning period of closed door s and windows, with no one entering or leaving 
except on  matters of u tmost n ecessity. She pr ohibi ted any talking aloud for a year and she pu t 
Remedios’ d aguerreotype in the place where her body  had been laid out, wi th a black ribbon around  
it and an oil lamp that was always kept lighted. Future genera tions, who n ever let th e lamp go out, 
would be puzzled at that girl in a ple ated skirt,  white boots, and with an organdy band around her  
head, and th ey were nev er able to  connect h er with  the sta ndard image of a great-grandmother.  
Amaranta  took charge of Aureliano J osé. She ad opted him as a son who  would share her solitude 
and relieve her from the involutary laudanum th at her mad beseeching had thrown into Remedios’  
coffee. Pietro Crespi would tiptoe in at dusk, with a black ribbon on his hat, and he would pay a 
silent visit to  Rebeca, wh o seemed  to be bleeding to death insid e the black d ress with sleeves down  
to her wrists. Just the idea of thinking abou t a new date for the wedding would have been so 
irreverent that the engagement turned into an eternal relationship, a fatigued love that no o ne 
worried about again, as if the lovers, who in other  days had sa botaged the l amps in order to kiss, had  
been abandoned to the free will of de ath. Having lost her bearings, completely demoralized, Rebeca 
began eating earth again. 
Suddenly—when the mourning had gone on so l ong that the needlepoint sessions began again—
someone pu shed open the street do or at two in the afternoo n in the mortal silence of the heat an d 
the braces in the foundation shook with such for ce that Amaranta and her friends sewing on the 
porch, Rebeca sucking her finger in her bedroom, Úrsula in the kitchen, Aureliano in the workshop,  
and even José Arcadio  Buendía under the solitary chestn ut tree had  the impression that a n 
earthquake was breaking up the house. A huge ma n had arrived. His square shoulders barely fitted 
through the doorways. He was wearing a medal of Our Lady of Help around his bison neck, his  
arms and chest were co mpletely cov ered with crypti c tatto oing, and on his right wrist was the tight 
copper bracelet of the niños-en-c ruz amulet. His skin was tanned by the salt of the open air, his hair 
was short an d straight like the mane  of a mule, his jaws were of ir on, and he wore a sad smile. He 
had a belt on that was twice as thick as the cinch of a horse, boots with leggings and spurs and iron 
on the heels, and his presence gave the quaking im pression of a seismic t remor. He w ent through 
the parlor an d the living room, carrying some half-w orn saddlebags in his hand, and he appeared like  
a thundercla p on the porch with the begonias wher e Amaranta and her friends were paralyzed, their  
needles in th e air. “Hello,” he said to them in a tired voice, threw the sa ddlebags on a wo rktable, and 
went by on his way to th e back of the house. “Hello ,” he said to the startled Rebecca, who saw hi m 
pass by the door of her bedroom. “Hello,” he sa id to Aureliano, who was at his silversmith’s bench 
with all five senses alert. He did not linger with anyone. He went directly to  the kitchen and there h e 
stopped for the first time at the end of a trip that had begun of the other side of the world. “Hello,” 
he said. Úrsula stood for a fraction of a second with her mouth open, looked into his e yes, gave a 
cry, and flung her arms around his neck, shouting and weeping with joy. It was José Arcadio. He wa s 
returning as poor as when he had left, to such an extreme that Úrsula had to give him two pesos  to 
pay for the rental of his horse. He spoke a Spanish that was  larded with sailor slang. They asked  
where he ha d been and h e answered: “Out there.” He hung his hammock i n the room they assigned 
him and slept for three days. When he woke up, af ter eating sixteen raw eggs, he went directly to  
Catarino’s store, where his monumental size prov oked a panic of curiosity among the women. He 
called for m usic and cane liquor fo r everyone, to be  put on his bill. He would Indian-wrestle with 
five men at the same time. “It can’t be done,” they said, convinced that th ey would not be able to  
move his arm. “He has niños-e n-cruz.” Catarino, who did not believe in  magical tricks of strength, bet 
him twelve p esos that he could not move the coun ter. José Arcadio pulle d it out of its pl ace, lifted it 
over his head, and put it in the street. It took elev en men to put it back. In the heat of the party h e 
 49GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
exhibited his unusual ma sculinity on the bar, compl etely covered with tattoos of word s in several 
languages intertwined in blue and red. To the wo men who were besieging him and cov eting him he 
put the question as to who would pay the most. The one who had the most money o ffered him 
twenty pesos. Then he proposed raffling himself off among them at ten pesos a chance. It was a  
fantastic price becaus e the most so ught-after woman earned eight pesos a night, but they all  
accepted. Th ey wrote th eir names on fourteen pieces of pap er which they put into a  hat and  each  
woman took  one out. Wh en there wer e only two pi eces left to d raw, it was es tablished to whom they 
belonged. 
“Five pesos more from each one,” José Arcadi o proposed, “and I’ll share myself with both. 
He made his living that way. He had  been around the world sixty-five times, enlisted in a crew of  
sailors without a coun try. The wom en who went to  bed with him that night in Catarino’s store 
brought him naked into the dance sal on so that peopl e could see that ther e was not a s quare inch of 
his body that was not tattooed, front and back, and  from his neck to his toes. He did not succeed i n 
becoming incorporated into the family. He slept a ll day and spent the night in the red-light district,  
making bets on his strength. On th e rare occa sions when Úrsula got him to  sit down a t the table, h e 
gave signs of radiant good humor, especially when he told ab out his adventures in remote coun tries. 
He had been  shipwrecked and spent two weeks a drift in the Sea of Japan, feeding on the body of a  
comrade wh o had succu mbed to  sunstroke and whose extrem ely salty flesh as it cooked in the sun  
had a sweet and granular taste. Under a bright noo nday sun in the Gulf of Bengal his ship had killed 
a sea dragon, in the stomach of which they foun d the helmet, the buckles, and the weapons of a 
Crusader. In the Caribbean he had seen the ghost of  the pirate ship of Victor Hugues, with its sails 
torn by the winds of death, the masts chewed by  sea worms, and still looking for the course to 
Guadeloupe.  Úrsula would weep at th e table as if she were read ing the letters that had never arrived 
and in which José Arca dio told abo ut his deeds an d misadventures. “And there was s o much of a  
home here for you, my son,” sh e would sob, “and so mu ch food thr own to the hogs!” But 
underneath i t an she coul d not con ceive that the b oy the gypsies took away was th e sam e lout wh o 
would eat half a suckling pig for lunch and whose fl atulence withered the flowers. Something similar 
took place with the rest of the family. Amaranta could not conceal the repugnance th at she felt at 
the table because of his bestial belchi ng. Arcadio,  who never knew the secret of their relationship, 
scarcely ans wered the q uestions tha t he asked wi th the ob vious idea of gaining his affection.  
Aureliano tried to relive the times wh en they slept in the sa me room, tried to revive the complicity 
of childhood, but José Arcadio had forgotten about it, because life at sea had saturated h is memory 
with too ma ny things to remember. Only Rebeca  succumbed to the first impact. The day tha t she 
saw him pass by her bedroom she thought that Pi etro Crespi was a sugary dandy next to tha t 
protomale whose volcanic breathing could be hear d all over the house. She tried to get near hi m 
under any pr etext. On a certain occas ion José Arca dio looked at her body with shameless atten tion 
and said to  her “You’re a woman,  little sister.” Re beca lost control of herself. She went ba ck to  
eating earth and the whitewash on th e walls with the avidity o f previous days, and she sucked her 
finger with so much anxiety tha t she developed a callus on her thumb. She vomited up a  green liquid 
with dead leeches in it. S he spent nig hts awake sh aking with fever, fightin g against delirium, waiting  
until the house shook with the return of José Arcadio at dawn. One afternoon, when everyone was  
having a sies ta, she could  no longer r esist and we nt to his bedroom. She found him in his shorts, 
lying in the hammock that he had hung from the beams with a ship’s hawser. She was so impressed 
by his enormous motley nakedness  that she felt an  impulse to retreat. “Excuse me,” she said, “I 
didn’t know you were here.” But she lowered her voice so as not to wake a nyone up. “Come here,” 
he said. Rebeca obeyed. She stopped  beside the hammo ck in an icy sweat, feeling knots forming in 
her intestines, while José Arcadio stro ked her ankl es wi th the tips of his finger s, then her calves, then  
her thighs, murmuring: “Oh, little sister, little sister.” She had to make a supernatural effort not to 
 50GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
die when a s tartlingly regulated cyclo nic power lifted her up by the waist a nd despoiled her of her  
intimacy with three clas hes of its claws and qua rtered her like a little bird. She managed to than k 
God for having been born before she lost herself in the incon ceivable plea sure of that unbearable 
pain, splashing in the steaming marsh of the hamm ock which absorbed the explosion of blood like a 
blotter. 
Three days later they wer e married during the five -o’clock mass. José Arcadio had gone t o Pietro 
Crespi’s store the day before. He found him giving  a zither lesson and did not draw him aside to 
speak to him . “I’m going to marry R ebeca,” he tol d him. Pietro Crespi turned pale, gave the zith er to 
one of his pupils, and dismissed the cl ass. When th ey were alone in the roo m that was crowded with  
musical instruments and mechan ical toys, Pietro Crespi said: 
“She’s your sister.” 
“I don’t care,” José Arcadio replied. 
Pietro Crespi mopped his brow with the hand kerchi ef that was s oaked in lavender. 
“It’s against nature,” he explained, “and besides, it’s against the law.” 
José Arcadio  grew impatient, not so much at th e argument as over Pietro Crespi’s paleness. 
“Fuck nature two  times over,” he said. “And I’ve  come to tel l you not to  bother goin g to ask 
Rebeca an ything.” 
But his brutal deportment broke down when he sa w Pietro Crespi’s eyes grow moist. 
“Now,” he said to him in a different  tone, “if you really like the family, there’s Amaranta for  
you.” 
Father Nicanor revealed in his Sunday sermon th at José Arcadio and Rebeca were not brother  
and sister. Úrsula never forgave what she considered  an incon ceivable lack of respect an d when the y 
came ba ck from church she forbade the newlywed s to set foot in the house again. For her it was as 
if they were dead. So they rented a ho use across fr om the cemetery and es tablished them selves there 
with no other furniture but José Arcadio’s hammoc k. On thei r wedding night a scorpion that had  
got into her slipper bit Rebeca on the foot. Her tongue went to sleep, but that did not stop them  
from spending a scandal ous honeymoon. The nei ghbors were startled by the cries that woke up the 
whole district as many as eight ti mes i n a single ni ght and three times  during siesta, an d they praye d 
that such wil d passion would not disturb the peace of the dead. 
Aureliano was the o nly one who was concerned a bout them.  He bought them some furniture and 
gave them s ome money until José Ar cadio recovere d his sense of reality and began to work the no-
man’s-land that bordered the courtyard of th e house. Amaranta, on the other hand, never did 
overcome h er rancor against Rebeca , even though  life offere d her a satisfaction of which she had  
not dreamed : at the initiative of Úrsula, who did not know how to repair t he shame, Pietro Crespi 
continued having lunch at the house on Tuesdays , rising above his defea t with a  seren e dignity. H e 
still wore the black ribbon on his hat as a sign of  respect f or the family, and he took pleasure in 
showing his affection for Úrsula by bringing her ex otic gifts: Portuguese sardines, Turkish rose 
marmalade, and on one occasion a l ovely Manila sh awl. Ama ranta looked after him with a loving 
diligence. She anticipated his wants,  pulled out the th reads on the cuffs of his shirt, and embroidered 
a dozen handkerchiefs with his initials for his bi rthday. On Tu esdays, after lunch, while she would 
embroider on the porch, he would  keep her happy  comp any. For Pietro Crespi, that woman who m 
he always ha d considered and treated as a child was a revelation. Although her tempera ment lacked  
grace, she had a rare sensibility for appreciating the things of the world and had a secret tenderness . 
One Tuesday, when no one doubted that sooner or later  it had to happen, Pietr o Crespi asked her to 
marry him. She did not stop her work. She waited for the hot blush to leave her ears and gave her 
voice a seren e stress of maturity. 
“Of course, Crespi,” she said. “But when we know each oth er better. It’s n ever good to  be has ty 
in things.” 
 51GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Úrsula was confused. In spite of the esteem sh e had for Pietro Crespi, she could not tell whether  
his decision was good or bad from the moral point of view after hi s prolonged and famou s 
engagement to Rebeca. But she finally accepted it as an unqualified fact because no one shared her  
doubts. Aureliano, who was the man o f the house, c onfused her further with his enigmatic and final 
opinion: 
“These are not times to g o around thinking about weddings.” 
That opinion, which Úr sula understood only some  mon ths later, was  the only sincere one that 
Aureliano could express at that moment, not only wi th respect to marriage, but to anything that was  
not war. He himself, facing a firing squad, woul d not understand too well  the concatenation of the 
series of subtle but irrevocable accidents that brou ght him to t hat point. The death of Remedios had  
not produced the despai r that he had feared. It was,  rather, a dull feeling of rage that grades ally 
dissolved in  a solitary and passive frustration simila r to the one he had felt during the time he was  
resigned to living without a woman. He plunged into  his work again, but he kept up the custom of  
playing dominoes with his father-in-law. In a house bound up in mourning, the nightly 
conversation s consolidated the friendship between  the two men . “Get married again. Aurelito,” his 
father-in-law would tell him. “I have six daughter s for you to choose from.” On one occasion on the 
eve of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote retur ned from one of his freque nt trips worried about 
the political situation in the country. The Liberals were deter mined to go to war. Since Aureliano a t 
that time had very confused notions about th e difference between Conservatives and Liberals, his 
father-in-law  gave him some schemati c lessons. Th e Liberals, he said, were Freemasons, bad people,  
wanting to hang priests, to institute civil marriage and divorce, to recognize the rights of illegitimate  
children as equal to those of legitimate ones, and to cut the country up into a federal system tha t 
would take power away from the supreme authorit y. The Conservatives, on the other hand, who had 
received thei r power directly from God, proposed the establishment of p ublic order and family 
morality. Th ey were th e defenders of the faith  of Chr ist, of the principle o f authority, a nd were n ot 
prepared to permit the country to be broken down into autonomou s entities. B ecause of hi s 
humanitarian  feelings Aureliano sympa thized with the Liberal attitude with r espect to the rights of 
natural children, but in a ny case, h e could not understand h ow people a rrived at the extreme of 
waging war over things that could no t be touched  with the ha nd. It seemed an exaggeration to him 
that for the elections hi s father-in-law had th em send six soldiers armed with rifles under th e 
command of  a sergeant to a town with no political passions. They not only arrived, but  they went 
from house to house confiscating hunting weapons , machetes , and even kitchen knives before they 
distributed among males over twenty-one the bl ue ballots with the nam es of the C onservative 
candidates a nd the red ballots with the names of the Liberal candidates. On the eve of the election s 
Don Apolinar Moscote himself read a decree that pr ohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages and the 
gathering together of m ore than three people w ho were no t of the sam e family. The elections to ok 
place with out incident. At eight o’clock on Sunday morning a wooden ball ot box was  set up in the 
square, which was watched over by the six soldiers. The voting was absolutely free, as Aureliano 
himself was able to a ttest since he sp ent almost th e entire da y with his fath er-in-law seeing that no 
one voted more than once. At four in the after noon a roll of drums in the square announced the 
closing of the polls and Don Apolinar Moscote se aled th e ballot box with a label crossed by hi s 
signature. That night, whil e he pla yed d ominoes wi th Aureliano, he ordered th e sergeant to break th e 
seal in order to count the votes. There were almost as  many red ballots as blue, but the sergeant left 
only ten  red ones and  made up the dif ference with  blue ones. T hen they seal ed the box a gain with a  
new label  and the first th ing on the f ollowing day it was  taken  to th e capital of the pro vince. “The 
Liberals will go to war,” Aurelia no said. Don Apolinar concentrated  on his domino pieces. “If you’re  
saying that because of the switch in ballots, they won’t,” he said. “We left a few red ones in so there 
won’t be any complaints.” Aureliano understood the disadvantages of being in the opposition. “If I 
 52GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
were a Liberal,” he said, “I’d go to war because o f those ballots.” His father-in-law looked at him 
over his glasses. 
“Come now, Aurelito,” he said, “if you were a Libe ral, even though you’re my son-in-law, you 
wouldn’t have seen th e switching of the ballots.” 
What really caused indignation in th e town was. n ot the results of the elections but the fact tha t 
the soldiers had not retu rned the weapons. A grou p of women spoke wi th Aureliano so that he 
could obtain  the return of their kitchen knives from his father-in-law. Don Apoli nar Moscote 
explained to him, in stric test c onfidence, that the s oldiers had ta ken the weapons off as proof that 
the Liberals were prepari ng for war. The cynicis m of  the remark alarmed him. He said nothing, but 
on a certain night when Gerineldo Márquez and Ma gnífico V isbal were speaking with some other 
friends about the incident of the knives, they as ked him if he was a Liberal or a Conservative.  
Aureliano did not hesitate. 
“If I have to be something I’ll be a Liberal,” he said, “because  the Conservatives are tricky.” 
On the following day, at the urging of his friends,  he wen t to see Dr. Alirio  Noguera to be trea ted 
for a supposed pain in his liver. He did not even  understand the meaning of the subterfuge. Dr. 
Alirio Nogu era had arrived in Macondo a few years before wit h a medicine chest of tasteless pills 
and a medical motto tha t convinced no one: One nail draw s another. In rea lity he was a charlatan . 
Behind his innocent façade of a doctor without pr estige there was hidden a terrorist who with his  
short legged boots covered the scars that five years in  the stocks had left on his legs. Ta ken prisoner 
during the first federalist adventure, he managed to  escape to Curaçao disguised in the garment he 
detested mo st in this world: a cassock. At the en d of a prolonged exile, stirred up by the excitin g 
news that exi les from all over the Caribbean brou ght to Curaçao,  he set out in a smuggler’s schooner 
and appeared in Riohacha with the bottles of pills that were nothing but refined sugar a nd a diploma 
from the University of Leipzig that he had forg ed himself. He wept with disappointment. The fed-
eralist fervor, which the exiles had pictured as a p owder keg about to expl ode, had dissolved into a  
vague electoral illusion. E mbittered by failure, yearning for a sa fe place where he could a wait old age,  
the false homeopath too k refuge in Macondo. In the narrow bottle-crowd ed room that he rented o n 
one side of  the square, he lived sever al years off the hopelessl y ill who, after having tried everything,  
consoled themselves with sugar pills. His instincts of an agitator remained dormant as long as Don 
Apolinar Moscote was a figurehead. He passed the time remembering and fighting against asthma.  
The  approach of the elections was th e thread that  led him once more to the skein of subversion. He 
made con tact with the yo ung peopl e in the town, who lacked politic al knowledge, and he embarked  
on a steal thy campaign of instigation. The numer ous red ballots that app eared is the box and that  
were attributed by Don Apolinar Moscote to the cu riosity that came from youth were part of his 
plan: he made his disciples vote in order to s how them th at elections were a farce. “The only 
effective thing,” he would say, “is violence.” Th e majority of Aureliano’s friends were enthusiastic 
over the idea of liquidating the Conservative esta blishment, but no one had dared include him in the 
plans, not o nly because of his ties with the ma gistrate, but because of  his solitary and elusive 
character. It was known, furthermore, that he had  voted blue at his father-in-law’s direction. So it 
was a simple matter of ch ance tha t he revealed his po litical sentiments, and it was purely a matter of 
curiosity, a caprice, that brought him to visit the doctor for the treatment of a pain th at he did not  
have. In the den that smelled of camphorated cobwebs he found himself facing a kind of dusty 
iguana whose lungs whistled when h e breathed. Before asking him any questions the doctor too k 
him to the window and examined the inside of his lower eyelid. “It’s not there,” Aureliano said, 
following what they told him. He pushed the tip s of his fingers into his liver and added: “Here’s 
where I have the pain that won’t let me sleep.” Then Dr. Noguera closed the win dow with th e 
pretext that there was to o much sun, and explained to  him in simple terms that it was  a patriotic 
duty to assassinate Conservatives. Fo r several days Aureliano carried a small bottle of pills in his  
 53GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
shirt pocket. He would take it out ev ery two hour s, put three pills in the palm of his hand, and pop  
them into hi s mouth for them to be s lowly di ssolved on his tongue. Don Apolinar Moscote made 
fun of his fa ith in homeopathy, but those who were  in on the plot recognized another one of their  
people in him. Almost all of the sons of the fo unders were implicated, although none of them knew 
concretely what action th ey were pl otting. Nevertheless, the d ay the do ctor revealed the secret to  
Aureliano, the latter elicited the whol e plan of th e conspiracy.  Although h e was convinced at tha t 
time of the u rgency of liquidating  the Conservative regime, the plot  horrified him. Dr. Noguera had  
a mystique of personal assassination. His system was reduced  to coordina ting a series of individua l 
actions which in one ma ster stroke covering the whole natio n would liquidate the fun ctionaries of 
the regime along with t heir respective families, especially the children, in order to exterminate 
Conservatism at its roots. Don Apol inar Moscote, his wife, and his six daughters, needless to say,  
were on the l ist. 
“You’re no Liberal or anything else,” Aureliano to ld him witho ut getting excited. “You’re nothing 
but a butcher.” 
“In that case,” the docto r replied with equal calm , “give me back the bo ttle. You don’t need i t 
any more.” 
Only six months later  did Aureliano learn that th e doctor had  given up on him as a man of a ction 
because he was a sentim ental person with no future, with a passive character, and a definite solitary 
vocation. They tried to keep him surrounded, fearin g that he would betray the conspiracy. Aureliano 
calmed them  down: he would not sa y a word, but on th e nigh t they went to murder the Moscote 
family they would find him guarding the door. He showed such a convinci ng decision that the plan 
was postpon ed for an in definite date.  It was  during  those days  that Úrsula asked his opinion about 
the marriage between Pietro Crespi and Amaran ta, an d he answered that these were not times to be 
thinking about such a thi ng. For a week he had  been  carrying an old-fashioned pistol under his shirt.  
He kept his eyes on his friends. In the afternoon he would go have coffee with José Arcadio and  
Rebeca, who  had begun to put their  house in o rder, and from seven o’ clock on he would play 
dominoes wi th his father-in-law. At lunchtime he wa s chatting with Arcadio , who was alr eady a huge 
adolescent, and he found him more a nd more exci ted over the imminence of war. In sc hool, where 
Arcadio had pupils older than himself mixed in wi th children who were barely beginning to talk, the 
Liberal fever had caught on. There was talk of shoot ing Father Nicanor, of turning the church into a 
school, of instituting free love. Aureliano tried to calm down his drive. He recommended discretion 
and prudence to him. Deaf to his calm reasoning, to  his sense of reality, Arcadio reproached him in 
public for his weakness  of character. Aureliano waited.  Finally, in the beginning of December,  
Úrsula burst into the wor kshop all upset. 
“War’s broken out!” 
War, in fact, had broken out three mo nths before . Martial law was in effect in the whole country. 
The only on e who knew it immediately was Don  Apo linar Moscote, but he did not g ive the news  
even to his wife while the army  platoon that was to occupy the town by surprise was on its way.  
They entered noiselessly before dawn, with two pieces  of light artillery drawn by mules, and they set 
up their headquarters in the school. A 6 P.M. curfew was esta blished. A more drastic search than the 
previous one was undertaken, house by house, and this time they even took farm implements. They 
dragged out Dr. Noguera , tied him to a tree in th e square, and shot him without any due process of 
law. Father Nicanor tried to impress the military authorities with the mir acle of levitation and had 
his head split open by the butt of a sol dier’s rifle. The Liberal ex altation had been extingu ished into a  
silent terror. Aureliano, pale, mysteri ous, contin ued playing dominoes with his father-in-law. He 
understood that in spite of his present title of civil and military leader of  the town, Don Apolinar 
Moscote wa s once more a figurehead. The decisions were made by the a rmy captain,  who each  
morning collected an extraordinary levy for the defe nse of public order. Four soldiers under hi s 
 54GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
command sn atched a wo man who had been bitten by a mad dog from her family and killed her with  
their rifle butts. One Sunday, two  weeks after the occup ation, Aureliano entered  Gerineldo 
Márquez’s house and with his usual terseness asked for a mug of coffee without sugar. When the 
two of them  were alone in the kitchen, Aureliano ga ve his voice an au thority that had never been 
heard before. “Get th e boys ready,” he said. “W e’re going to war.” Ger ineldo Márquez did no t 
believe him. 
“With what weapons?” he asked. 
“With theirs,” Aureliano replied. 
Tuesday a t midnight in a mad  operation, twenty-one men  under the age o f thirty com manded b y 
Aureliano B uendía, arm ed with tabl e knives an d sharpened  tools, took  the garrison by surprise, 
seized the weapons, and in the courtyard executed the captain and the four soldiers wh o had killed 
the woman. 
That same night, while the sound of the firing  squad could be heard, Arcadio was named civil  
and military leader of th e town. The married reb els barely had time to take leave of t heir wives, 
whom they left to their our devices. They left at dawn, cheered by the people who had been  
liberated from the terror, to join the forces of  the revolutionary general Victorio M edina, who , 
according to  the lates t reports, was o n his wa y to Manaure. Before leaving, Aureliano br ought Don 
Apolinar Moscote out o f a closet. “Rest easy, fa ther-in-law,” he told him. “The new government 
guarantees on its word of honor your personal saf ety and that of your family.” D on Apolinar  
Moscote ha d trouble identifying that conspirato r in high boots and wi th a rifle slung over his 
shoulder with the person  he had played dominoes with until nine in the evening. 
“This is madness, Aurelito,” he exclaimed.

Chapter 6 
COLONE L AURELIA NO BUENDÍA organized thirty-two armed uprising s and he lost them all. He had  
seventeen m ale children by seventeen  different women and they were exterminated o ne after the 
other on a single night before the oldest one had reached the age of thirty- five. He survived fourteen  
attemp ts on his life, se venty-three ambushes, and a firing squad. He lived through a dose of 
strychnine in his coffee that was eno ugh to kill a horse. He refused the Order of Merit, which the 
President of the R epublic awarded h im. He rose to be Com mander in C hief of the r evolutionary 
forces, with jurisdiction and comman d from one bor der to th e other, and  the man  most feared by 
the government, but he never let himself be photog raphed. He declined the lifetime pension offere d 
him after the war and  until old a ge he mad e his living from the little gold fishes that he 
manufactured in his workshop in Macondo. Although he always fought at the head  of his men, the 
only wound that h e received was the one h e gave himself after signing the Treaty of Neerlandia,  
which put a n end to alm ost twenty years of civil war.  He shot himself in the chest with a pistol and  
the bullet ca me out through his back without dam aging any vit al organ. The  only thing le ft of all that 
was a street that bore his  name in Ma condo. And yet,  as he d eclared a few years before he died of 
old age, he had not expected an y of that on the da wn he left with his twenty-one men to join the 
forces of General Victorio Medina. 
“We leave Macondo in yo ur care.” was all that h e said to Arcadio before leav ing. “We leave it to  
you in good shape, try to have it in better shape wh en we return. ” 
Arcadio gave a very personal interpretation to th e instructions. He invented a uniform with the 
braid and epaulets of a m arshal, inspired by the prints in one of Melquíades’ books, and around his 
waist he buckled the saber with gold tassels that ha d belonged to the executed captain. He set up th e 
two artillery pieces at the entrance to town, put uniforms on his form er pupils, w ho had been 
amused by his fiery proclamations, and let them wand er through the streets  armed in order to give 
outsiders an impression of invulnerability. It wa s a double-edged deception, for the government did 
not dare a ttack the place for ten mon ths, but when it did it unleashed such a large force against it 
that resistan ce was  liquidated in a h alf hour. From  the first day of his rule Arcadio  revealed his  
predilection for decrees. He would read as man y as four a day in order to decree an d institute 
everything that came into his head. He imposed obligatory military service for men over eighteen, 
declared to be public property any a nimals walkin g the streets after six in the evening , and mad e 
men who were overage wear red armbands. He seque stered  Father Nicanor in the parish house 
under pain of execution and prohibited him from sayi ng mass or rin ging the bells unless  it was for a 
Liberal victory. In order that no one would doubt th e severity of his aims, he ordered a firing squad  
organized in the square and had it s hoot at a s carecrow. At first no one t ook him ser iously. They 
were, after all, schoolchildren playing at being gr own-ups. But one night, when Arcadio went into 
Catarino’s store, the tru mpeter in th e group greeted  him with a fanfare that made th e customers  
laugh and Ar cadio had hi m shot for di srespect for the authorities. People wh o protested  were put on 
bread and water with their ankles in a set of st ocks that he had set up in a school room. “You 
murderer!” Úrsula would shout at him every tim e she learned of some n ew arbitrary act. “When  
Aureliano finds out he’s going to shoot  you and I’ll be the first one to be glad.” But it w as of no use. 
Arcadio con tinued tightening the tourniquet with unnecessary rigor until he becam e the cruelest 
ruler that Macondo had ever known. “Now let th em suffer the difference,” Don Apolinar Moscote 
said on one occasion. “This is the Liberal paradise .” Arcadio found out about it. At the head of a  
patrol he assaulted th e house, destro yed th e furnit ure, flogged  the daughters, and dragged out Don 
Apolinar Moscote. When  Úrsula burst into the courtya rd of headquarters, after having gone through 
 56GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
the to wn sh outing sham e and brand ishing with rage a pitch -covered wh ip, Arcadio himself was  
preparing to give the squad the command to fire. 
“I dare you to, bastard!” Úrsula shouted. 
Before Arca dio had tim e to read sh e let go with the first b low of the l ash. “I dare you to,  
murderer!” s he shouted. “And kill me  too, son of an  evil mother. That way I won’t have the eyes to  
weep for the shame of having raised a monster.” Whipping him without mercy, she chased him to  
the back of the courtyar d, where Arcadio curled up like a snail in its shell. Don Apolinar Moscote 
was unconscious, tied to the post wh ere previously they had ha d the scarecrow that h ad been cut to  
pieces b y shots fired in fun. The boys  in the squad  scattered, fearful that Úrsula would g o after th em 
too. But she did not even look at them. She left Arcadio with  his uniform torn, roaring with pain  
and rage, and she untied Don Ap olinar Moscote and to ok him home. Before leaving the 
headquarters  she released  the prisoners from the stocks. 
From that ti me on she was the one who ruled i n the to wn. She reestabli shed Sunday masses, 
suspended the use of red armbands,  and abrogated the harebrained decrees. But in spite of her  
strength, she still wept over her unfo rtunate fate. She felt so m uch alone that she sought the useless 
company of her husband, who had b een forgotten under the ch estnut tree. “Look what we’ve com e 
to,” she would tell him as the June rains threatened to knock the shelter do wn. “Look at the emp ty 
house, our children scattered all over the world, and the two of us alone again, the same as in the 
beginning.” José Arcadio Buendía, su nk in an aby ss of unawar eness, was deaf to her lamentations. 
At the beginning of his madness he would announ ce his daily needs with urgent Latin phrases. In 
fleeting clear spells of lucidity, when Amaranta  would bring him his meals  he would tell her what 
bothered hi m most and would accept her sucking glasses and mustard pl asters in a do cile way. But a t 
the tim e when Úrsula went to lam ent by his side h e had lost all conta ct with  reality. She would bath e 
him bit by bit as he sat on his stool while she ga ve him news of the family. “Aureliano went to war 
more than four months ago and we haven’t heard anything abo ut him,” she would say, scrubbing his 
back with a soaped brush. “José Arcadio came b ack a big man, taller than you, and all covered with  
needle-work, but he only brought sha me to our ho use.” She thought she noticed, however, that her  
husband wo uld grow sad with th e bad news. Th en she d ecided to lie to him. ‘Rou won’t believ e 
what I’m going to tell yo u,” she said as she threw ashes over his excrement in order to pick it up  
with the sho vel. “God willed that José Arcadio and  Rebeca sho uld get married, and now they’re very 
happy.” She got to be so sincere in the decep tion that she en ded up by consoling herself with her  
own lies. “Arcadio is a serious man now,” she sai d, “and very brave, and a fine-looking young man 
with his uniform and saber.” It was like speaking  to a dead  man, for José Arcadio B uendía wa s 
already beyo nd the reach  of any worry. But she insi sted. He seemed so pea ceful, so indifferent to  
everything that she d ecided to releas e him. He di d not even move from his stool. He stayed there, 
exposed to the sun and the rain, as if the thongs were unnecessary, for a dominion superior to any 
visible bond kept him tied to the trunk of the ches tnut tree. T oward August, when winter began to 
last forever, Úrsula was finally able to give him a piece of news that sounded like the truth . 
“Would you believe it that good luck is still pou ring down on u s?” she told him. “Amaranta and 
the pianola I talian are going to get ma rried.” 
Amaranta  and Pietro Crespi had, in fact, deepen ed their friendship, protected  by Úrsula, who thi s 
time did not think it nec essary to watch over th e visits. It wa s a twilight engagement.  The Italian 
would arrive at dusk, with  a gardenia i n his button hole, and he would trans late Petrarch’ s sonnets for 
Amaranta. T hey would si t on th e porch, suffocated by th e orega no and th e roses, he read ing and she 
sewing lace cuffs, ind ifferent to the shocks and bad news of the war, until the mosquitoes made 
them take refuge in the parlor. Amaranta’s sens ibility, her discreet but en veloping tenderness had  
been wearin g an invisible web about her fiancé, whic h he had to push aside materially with his pale 
and ringless fingers in order to leave the house a t eight o’clock. They had put together  a delightful 
 57GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
album with the postcards that Pi etro Crespi received from Italy. They were pictures o f lovers in 
lonely parks, with vignettes of he arts pierced with arrows and gold en ribbons held by doves. “I’ve 
been to  this park in Florence,” Pietro Crespi woul d say, going through the cards. “A person can put  
out his hand and the bir ds will come to feed.” So metimes, over a watercolor of Venice, nostalgia  
would trans form the s mell of mud an d putrefying sh ellfish of the canals in to the warm  aroma o f 
flowers. Amaranta woul d sigh, laugh, and drea m of a second homeland of handsome men and 
beautiful women who spoke a childlike language with  ancient cities of whose past grandeur only the 
cats among the rubble r emained. Af ter crossing the ocean  in search  of it, after having confused 
passion with the vehement stroking of Rebeca , Pietro Crespi had found love. Happiness was  
accompani ed by pros perity. His warehouse at that time occupied almost a whole block and it was a 
hothouse of fantasy, with reprodu ctions of the bel l tower of Florence tha t told time with a concert 
of carillons, and music boxes from Sorrento and comp acts from China that sang five-note melodies 
when they were opened, and all the musical instruments imaginable and all the mechan ical toys that 
could be conceived. Bruno Crespi, his younger brot her, was i n charge of the store b ecause Pietro  
Crespi barely had enough time to take care of the music school. Thanks to him the Street of the 
Turks, with  its dazzling display of knickknacks,  became a m elodic oasis where one could forget 
Arcadio’s arbitrary acts a nd the dista nt nightmar e of the war. When Úrsula ordered the revival of 
Sunday mass , Pietro Crespi donated a German harmonium to the church,  organized a children’s 
chorus, and prepared a Gregorian re pertory that added a note of sple ndor to Father Ni canor’s quiet 
rite. No one doubted th at he would make Amara nta a fortunate mate. Not pushing their feelings, 
letting thems elves be borne along by the natural fl ow of their hearth they reached a point where a ll 
that was left to do was s et a wedding date. Th ey did not enco unter any o bstacles. Úrsula accused  
herself inwardly of having twisted Rebecca’s desti ny with repeated postpo nements and  she was not 
about to  add more rem orse. The rigor of the mo urning for Remedios had been  relegated to  the 
background by the mortifications of the war, Aureliano’s absence, Arca dio’s brutality, and the 
expulsion of José Arcadio and Rebeca. With th e imminence of the weddi ng, Pietro Crespi had 
hinted that Aureliano José, in whom he had stir red up a love that was almost filial, would be 
considered their oldest child. Everything made Amaranta  think that she was headin g toward a  
smooth hap piness. But unlike Rebeca, she did not reveal the slightest anxiety. With the s ame 
patience with which she dyed  tablecloths, sewed  lace masterpieces, and  embroidered needlepoint  
peacocks, sh e waited for Pietro Crespi to be unable  to bear the urges of his heart and more. Her day 
came with the ill-fated October rains. Pietro Crespi took the sewing basket from her lap and he told 
her, “We’ll get married next month.” Amaranta d id not tremble at the contact with his  icy hands. 
She withdrew hers like a timid little a nimal and went back to h er work. 
“Don’t be simple, Crespi.” She smiled. “I wouldn’t marry you even if I were dead.” 
Pietro Crespi lost control of himself. He wept shamelessly, almost brea king his fingers with 
desperation, but he could  not break her down. “Don’t waste your time,” was all that Amaranta said . 
“If you really love me so much, don’t set foot in this house again.” Úrsula thought she would go 
mad with shame. Pietro Crespi exhausted all manner of pleas. He went thr ough incredible extremes  
of humiliation. He wept one whole afternoon in Úrsul a’s lap and she would have sold her soul in 
order to co mfort him. On rainy nights he could be  seen pro wling about the house wi th an umbrel la, 
waiting for a  light in Amaranta’s be droom. He was  never better dresse d than  at th at time.  His august 
head of a tor mented emp eror had acq uired a stran ge air of gra ndeur. He begged Amaranta’s friends, 
the ones wh o sewed with her on the porch, to try to persuade her. He neglected his business. He 
would spend the day in the rear of the store writing wild notes, which he would send to Amaranta  
with flower petals and  dried butterflies, and wh ich she would  return uno pened. He would shut 
himself up for hours on end to play the zither. O ne night he sang. Macondo woke up in a kind of 
angelic stup or that was caused by a zither tha t deserved more than this wo rld and a voice that led 
 58GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
one to believe that no other person on earth could feel such l ove. Pietro Crespi then saw the lights  
go on in every window i n town  except tha t of Am aranta. On  November second, All S ouls’ Day, hi s 
brother opened the stor e and found all the lamp s lighted, all the music b oxes opened , and all the 
docks striking an interminable hour, and in the mids t of that mad concert he found Pietro Crespi at 
the desk in the rear with his wrists cut by a ra zor and his hands thrust into a basin of benzoin. 
Úrsula decreed that the wake would  be in he r house. Father Nicanor was against a religious 
ceremony and burial in c onsecrated g round. Úrsula st ood up to him. “In a way that neither you nor  
I can understand, that m an was a sai nt,” she said. “So I am going to bury him, against your wishes, 
beside Melq uíades’ grave.” She did it with the support of the whole town and wi th a magnificent 
funeral. Amaranta did no t leave h er bedroom. From her bed s he heard Úrsula’s weepi ng, the steps  
and whispers of the multitude that inv aded the house, the wailing of the mourners, and then a deep 
silence that smelled of trampled flo wers. For a long time she kept on smelling Pietro Crespi’s 
lavender breath at dusk, but she had the strength not to succumb to delirium . Úrsula  abandoned her. 
She did not even raise her eyes to pi ty her on th e afternoon when Amaranta went in to the kitchen  
and put her hand into th e coals of th e stove until it hurt her so much that s he felt no m ore pain but 
instead smell ed the pes tilence of her own singed flesh. It was a stupid cu re for her remorse. For 
several days she went ab out the hous e with her h and in a pot of egg whites, and when the burns 
healed it app eared as if the whites ha d also sc arred over the sores on her heart. The o nly externa l 
trace that th e tragedy left was the bandage of blac k gauze that she put on her burned hand and that 
she wore until her death. 
Arcadio gave a rare display of generosity by decr eeing official m ourning for Pietro Crespi. Úrsula 
interpreted i t as the retu rn of the s trayed la mb. But she was  mistaken. S he had  lost Arcadio, not 
when he had put on his military uniform, but fro m the beginning. She thought she had raised him as 
a son, as she had raised Rebeca, with  no privilege s or discrimination. Nevertheless, Arcadio was a 
solitary and frightened child during the insomnia  plague, in the midst of Úrsula’s utilitarian fervor, 
during the delirium of José Arcadio  Buendía, the hermetism  of Aureliano, and the mortal rivalry 
between Am aranta and R ebeca. Aureli ano had tau ght him to read and write, thinking about other 
things, as he would have done with  a stranger. He gave him his clothi ng so that Visita ción could take 
it in when it was ready to be thrown a way. Arcadi o suffered from shoes tha t were too lar ge, from his 
patched pan ts, from his female butto cks. He neve r succeeded i n communicating with anyone better 
than he did with Visita ción and Ca taure in their language. Melquíades was  the only on e who really 
was concern ed with him as he made him listen to his incomprehensible tex ts and gave him lessons 
in the art of daguerreotype. No one imagined how  much he wept in secr et and the d esperation with  
which he tried to revive Melquíades with the useless study of  his papers. The school, where th ey 
paid atten tion to him and respected him, and then power, with his endless decrees and  his glorious  
uniform, freed him from the weight of an old bitterness. O ne night in Catarino’s store someon e 
dared tell hi m, “you don’t deserve the last name you carry.” Contrary to wh at everyone expected, 
Arcadio did not have hi m shot. 
“To my great honor,” he said, “I am not a Buendía. ” 
Those who knew the secret of his parentage tho ught that th e answer meant that he too was  
aware of it, but he had really never been. Pilar Te rnera, his m other, who had made his blood boil in 
the darkroom, was as m uch an irresistible obsession for him as she had been first for José Arcadio  
and then for Aureliano. In spite of her having lost  her charms and the splendor of he r laugh, he  
sought her out and found her by the trail of her sm ell of smoke. A short time before the war, one 
noon when she was later than usual in coming for her younger son at school, Arcadio was waiting  
for her in th e room wher e he was  accustomed to take  his siesta  and where h e later  set up  the stocks.  
While the ch ild played in the courtyar d, he waited in his hammock, trembling with anxiety, knowing 
that Pillar Ternera would have to pass through there. She arrived. Arcadio grabbed her by the wrist 
 59GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
and tried to pull her into the hammo ck. “I can’t, I can’t,” Pilar Ternera said in horror. “You can’t 
imagine how much I  wou ld like to m ake you h appy, but as Go d is my witn ess I ca n’t.” Arcadio took  
her by the waist with  his tremendous  hereditary s trength and he felt the world disappear with th e 
contact of her skin. “D on’t play the saint,” he sa id. “After all, everybody knows that you’re a  
whore.” Pilar overcame th e disgust that  her miserable fate inspired in her. 
“The children will find o ut,” she murmured. “It will be better if you leave the bar off the door  
tonight.” 
Arcadio waited for her that night tr embling with fever in his hammock . He waited  without 
sleeping, listening to the aroused crickets in the endless hours of early morning and the implacabl e 
telling of tim e by the curl ews, more and more convinced that he had been d eceived. Suddenly, when 
anxiety had broken down into rage, the door op ened. A few months later, facing the firing squad , 
Arcadio wo uld relive the wandering  steps in th e classroom,  the stu mbling against benches, and  
finally the bulk of a body in the shadows of the r oom and the breathing of air that was pumped by a  
heart tha t was not his. He stretch ed out his han d and found another ha nd with two  rings on the 
same finger about to go astray in th e darkness. He  felt the structure of th e veins, the pulse of its  
misfortune, and felt the damp palm with a lifeline cut off at the base of the thumb by the claws of  
death. Then he realized that this  was not the wom an he was wa iting for, because she did not smell of 
smoke but of flower lotion, and she had inflated, b lind breasts with nipples like. a man’s, a sex as 
stony and  round as a  nut, and th e chaotic tender ness of excited inexperience. She was  a virgin and 
she had th e unlikely name of Santa S ofía de la Piedad . Pilar Ternera had paid her fifty pesos, half of 
her life savings, to do wh at she was  doing. Arcadio,  had seen her many ti mes working in her parents’ 
small food store but he had never taken a good look at her because she had  that rare virtue of never 
existing completely excep t at the opp ortune mom ent. But from that day o n he huddled like a cat in 
the warmth of her armpit She would go to the school at siesta time with the consent of her parents, 
to whom Pilar Ternera hid paid the other half of her savings. Later on, when the government troops  
dislodged them from the place where they had m ade love, they did it among the cans of lard and 
sacks of cor n in the back of the stor e. About the time that Arcadio was named civil and militar y 
leader they h ad a daughter. 
The only relatives who knew about it were José Arcadio a nd Rebeca, with whom  Arcadio 
maintained close relations at that time,  based not so much on kinship as on complicity. José Arcadio 
had put his neck into th e marital yo ke. Rebeca’s  firm character, the vora city of her stomach, her  
tenacious am bition ab sorbed the trem endous ener gy of her hu sband, who ha d been  changed from a  
lazy, wom an-chasing man into an en ormous work an imal. They kept a clean and neat house. Rebeca 
would open it wide at d awn and th e wind from the graveyard would come in through the windows  
and go out through the doors to the yard and lea ve the whi tewashed walls and furniture tanned  by 
the saltpeter of the dead. Her hunger for earth, the cloc-cloc of her parents’ bones, the impatience of 
her blood as it faced Pietr o Crespi’s passivity were r elegated to  the attic of h er memory. All day long  
she would embroider beside the window, withdrawn from the uneasines s of the war, until the 
ceramic pots  would begin to vibrate in the cupboar d and she would get up to warm the meal, much 
before the appearance, first, of the m angy hounds,  and then of the colossus in leggings and spurs 
with a double-barreled shotgun, who sometimes carried a deer on his shoulder and almost always a  
string of rabbits or wild ducks. One afternoon, at  the beginning of his rule, Arcadio paid them a 
surprise visit. They had not seen him since they h ad left the house, but he seemed so friendly and  
familiar that they invited him to share the stew. 
Only when they were h aving coffee did Arcadi o reveal the motive behind his visit: he had  
received a complaint against José Arcadio. It was said that he had begun by plowing his own yard  
and had gone straight ahead into nei ghboring lands,  knocking down fences and buildings with his 
oxen until he took forcible possession of the best plots of land around. On the peasants whom he 
 60GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
had not des poiled becau se he was not interested  in their lands, he levied a contributi on which he 
collected  every Saturday with his hun ting dogs and his double-barreled shotgun. He di d not d eny it.  
He based his right on  the fact that the usurped lan ds had been distributed by José Arcadio Buendía 
at the time o f the founding, and he thought it possi ble to prove that his father had been crazy ever  
since that ti me, for he had disposed of a patrimony that r eally belonged to the family. It was an  
unnecessary allegation, because Arcadio had not come to do justice. He simply offered to set up a 
registry offic e so that José Arcadio could legaliz e his title to the usurped land, under the condition  
that he delegate to the local government the right to collect the contr ibutions. They made an  
agreement. Years later, when Colo nel Aureliano Buendía exa mined the titles to proper ty, he found 
registered in his brother’s name all of the land  between the hill where his yard was on up to the 
horizon, including the cemetery, and  discovered that  during the eleven m onths of his rule, Arcadio 
had collected not only the money of the contributi ons, but had also collected fees from people for 
the right to bury their dea d in José Arcadio’s land. 
It took Úrsula several months to find out what  was already public knowledge because people hid 
it from her so as not to increase her suffering . At first she suspected it.  “Arcadio is building a 
house,” she confided with feigned pride to her h usband as she tried to put a spoonful of calabash 
syrup into his mouth. Nevertheless, she involuntarily sighed  and said, “I do n’t know why, but all this  
has a b ad smell to me.” Later on, when she foun d out that Arcadio had  not only built a house bu t 
had ordered some Viennese furniture , she confirme d her suspicion that he was using public funds.  
“You’re the shame of our family name,” she shouted at him o ne Sunday after mass wh en she saw 
him in his new house playing cards with his officers.  Arcadio paid no atten tion to her. Only then di d 
Úrsula know  that he had a six-month-old daughter an d that Santa Sofía de la Piedad, with whom h e 
was living outside of m arriage, was pregnant a gain. She decided to  write to  Colon el Aureliano  
Buendía, wh erever he wa s, to bring him up to d ate on th e situ ation. But th e fast-moving events of 
those days not only prevented her  plans from  being carried out, they made her regret having 
conceived th em. The war, which until then had been only a word to designate a vague and remote 
circumstance, became a concrete an d dramatic real ity. Around the end of February an o ld woma n 
with an ashen look arrive d in Macondo riding a donkey loaded down with  brooms. She seemed s o 
inoffensive that the sentr ies let her pass without any questions as another vendor, one of the many 
who often arrived from the towns in the swamp. She went directly to the b arracks. Arcadio received 
her in the place where th e classroom used to be and which at that time ha d been transformed into a  
kind of rearguard encampment, with roiled hammo cks hanging on hooks and mats pil ed up in the 
corners, and rifles and ca rbines and even huntin g shotguns sca ttered on  the floor. The old woman  
stiffened into a military salute before identifying herself: 
“I am Colonel Gregorio Stevenson.” 
He brought bad news. T he last cen ters of Liberal resistance, according to what he s aid, were 
being wiped out. Colonel Aureliano Buendía, whom he had l eft fighting in retreat nea r Riohacha,  
had given him a messag e for Arcadio. He should surrender the town without resista nce on the 
condition th at the lives and property of Liberals would be respected. Arca dio examined that strange 
messenger who could have been a fugiti ve grandmother with a look of pity. 
“You have brought something in writing, naturally,” he said. 
“Naturally,” the emissary answered, “I have brough t nothing of the sort. It’s easy to understand  
that under th e present cir cumstances a  person can’t carry anythi ng that woul d compromise him.” 
As he was speaking he reached into his bodice and took out a small gold fish. “I think that this 
will be sufficient,” he said. Arcadi o could see that indeed  it was one of the li ttle fishes made by 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía. But anyone could have bough t it before the war or stolen it, and it had 
no merit as a safe-conduct pass. The messenger even went to the extreme of violating a military 
secret so tha t they would  believe his identity. He  revealed that he was on a mission to Curaçao,  
 61GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
where he hoped to recruit exiles from all ove r the Caribbean and acquire arms and supplies  
sufficient to attempt a l anding at th e end of th e year. With faith in that plan, Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía was not in favor of any useless sacrifices at that tim e. But Arcadio  was inflexible. He had  
the prisoner put into the stocks until he could pro ve his identity and he res olved to defend the to wn 
to the death.  
He did not have long to  wait. Th e news of th e Liberal defeat was more and more concrete.  
Toward the end of March, before a dawn of pr emature rain, the tens e calm of the previous weeks  
was abruptly broken by t he desperate sounds of a cornet and a cannon shot that knocked down the 
steeple of th e church. Actually, Arcad io’s decision to resist was madness. He had  only fifty poorly 
armed men with a ration of twenty ca rtridges apiece.  But amo ng them, his former pupils, excited by 
the high-sounding proclamations, the determinati on re igned to sacrifice their skins for a lost cause. 
In the midst of the tramping of boots, contradi ctory commands, cannon s hots that made the earth 
tremble, wild shooting, and the senseless sound of cornets, the supposed Colonel Stevenson 
managed to speak to Arcadio. “Don’t let me underg o the indignity of dying in the stocks in these 
women’s clo thes,” he sai d to him. “If I have to  die, let m e die fighting.” He succeed ed in convincing 
him. Arcadio ordered them to give him a weapon  and twenty cartridges, and he left him with five 
men to defend headquarters while he went off with his staff to head up the resistance. He did not  
get to the r oad to the s wamp. The barricades had been bro ken and the defenders were openly 
fighting in the streets, first until they used up  their ration of rifle bullets, then with  pistols against 
rifles, and finally hand to hand. With the immi nence of defeat, some wo men went in to the street 
armed with s ticks and kitchen knives. In that confusion Arcadio found Amaranta, who was looking 
for him like a mad woman, in her ni ghtgown and with  two old pistols that had belonged to José 
Arcadio Buendía. He gave his rifle to an officer who had been disarmed  in the fight and escaped 
with Amara nta through a nearby street to take her home. Úrsula was, in the doorway waiting,  
indifferent t o the cannon shots that had opened up a hole in the front of the house next door. The 
rain was letting up, but the streets were as slippe ry and as smooth as melted soap, and one had to  
guess distances in the dar kness. Arcadio left Amar anta with Úr sula and m ade an attemp t to face two 
soldiers who had opened  up with heavy firing from  the corner. The old pistols that ha d been kep t 
for many years in the bu reau did not work. Protecti ng Arcadi o with her b ody, Úrsula tried to drag  
him toward the house. 
“Come along in the name of God,” she shouted at him. “There’s been enough madness!” 
The soldiers aimed at them. 
“Let go of that man, ma’am,” one of them shouted , “or we won’t be responsible!” 
Arcadio pus hed Úrsula toward the house and  surrendered. A short time later  the shooting 
stopped and the bells began to toll. The resistance had been wi ped out in less than half an hour. Not  
a single one of Arcadio’s men had survived the attack, but before dying they had killed three 
hundred soldiers. The la st stronghold was the barra cks. Before being attacked, the supposed Colonel  
Gregorio Stevenson had freed the prisoners and orde red his men to go out and fight in the street.  
The extraordinary mobility and accu rate aim with which he placed his twenty cartri dges gave the 
impression that the barracks was well-defended, and the attackers blew it to pieces with cannon fire. 
The captain who directed the opera tion was startled to find the rubbl e deserted and a  single dead 
man in his undershorts with an empty rifle still clu tched in an arm that ha d been blown completely 
off. He had a woman’s f ull head of hair held at th e neck with a comb and on his neck a chain with a  
small gold fish. When he turned him over with the tip of his boot and put the light on his face, the 
captain was perplexed. “Jesus Christ,” he  exclaimed. Other officers came ov er. 
“Look where this fellow turned up,” the captain s aid. “It’s Gregorio Stevenson.” 
At da wn, after a summar y court m artial, Arcadio wa s shot again st the wall of  the cemeter y. In the 
last two hou rs of his life  he did not manage to understand why the fear that had tormented h im 
 62GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
since childhood had disappeared. Impassive. withou t even worrying about making a show of his 
recent bravery, he listened to th e interminable ch arges of the a ccusation. H e thought ab out Úrsula,  
who at th at hour must have been un der the ches tnut tree havi ng coffee with José Arca dio Buendía. 
He thought about his eight-month-old daugh ter, who still ha d no name, and about the child who 
was going to be born in August. He thought about Santa Sofía de la Piedad, whom he had left the 
night before salting down a deer for next day’s lunch, and he missed her hair pouring over her 
shoulders and her eyelas hes, which l ooked as if they were ar tificial. He thought about his peop le 
without sentimentality, with a strict dosing of his accounts with life, beginning to understand how 
much he rea lly loved the people he h ated most. T he president of the court-martial began his final 
speech when  Arcadio  realized th at two  hours had p assed. “Even  if the proven charges di d not h ave 
merit enoug h,” the president was saying, “the ir responsible and criminal boldness with which the 
accused drove his subo rdinates on to a useless death would be enough to deserve capital  
punishment.” In the shattered school house where for the first time he had  felt the secur ity of power,  
a few feet from the roo m where he had come to  know the u ncertainty of love, Arcadi o found the 
formality of death ridiculous. Death really did no t matter to  him but life did, and therefore the 
sensation he felt when they gave their decision was not a feeling of fear but  of nostalgia. He did not 
speak until they asked hi m for his last request. 
“Tell my wife,” he answered in a well-modulated vo ice, “to give the girl the name of Úrsula.” He 
paused and s aid it again: “Úrsula, like her grandmother.  And tell her also that if the child that is to b e 
born is a boy, they should name him J osé Arcadio,  not for his uncle, but for his grandfather.” 
Before they took him to the executio n wall Father  Nicanor tried to attend him. “I have nothing  
to repent,” Arcadio said, and he put  himself und er the orders of the squa d after drin king a cup o f 
black coffee. The leader of the squad, a specialist in summary executions, had a name that had much 
more about it than ch ance: Ca ptain Roque Carnicero, which me ant bu tcher. On the way to  the 
cemetery, under the persistent drizzle,  Arcadio sa w that a radiant Wednes day was brea king out on 
the horizon. His nostalgia disappeared  with th e mist and left an  immense cu riosity in its place. Only 
when they ordered him to put his back to the wall  did Arcadio see Rebeca, with wet hair  and a pink  
flowered dress, opening wide the do or. He made an  effort to get her to recognize him. And Rebeca  
did take a casual look toward the wal l and was para lyzed with stupor, barely able to react and wave 
good-bye to Arcadio. Arcadio answered her the same  way. At that instant the smoking mouths of 
the rifles were aimed a t him and l etter by letter h e heard the en cyclic als th at Melquíades had chanted 
and he heard  the lost steps of Santa Sofía de la Pi edad, a virgin, in the classroom, and in his nose he 
felt the same icy hardness that had drawn his attention in the nostrils of the corpse of Remedios.  
“Oh, God damn it!” he managed to think. “I forgot to say th at if it was a girl they should name her 
Remedi os.” Then, all accumulated in the rip of a cl aw, he felt a gain all the terror that ha d tormented  
him in his life. The captai n gave the o rder to fire . Arcadio barely had time to put out his chest and  
raise his head, not understanding where the hot liq uid that burned his thighs was pouring from. 
“Bastards!” he shouted. “Long live the Liberal Party!”

Chapter 7 
THE WAR was over in May. Two weeks before the government made the official announcement in a 
high-sounding proclamation, which promised merc iless punishment for those who had started the 
rebellion, Colonel Aureliano Buendía fell prisoner just as he wa s about to reach the western frontier  
disguised as an Indian witch doctor. Of the twen ty-one men who had followed him to war, fourteen 
fell in combat, six were wounded, an d only one a ccompanied him at the moment of final defeat: 
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. The news of his capt ure was announced in Macondo with a special 
proclamation. “He’s alive,” Úrsula t old her husban d. “Let’s pray to God  for his enemies to show 
him clemen cy.” After thr ee days  of weeping, on e after noon as she was s tirring some sweet milk 
candy in the kitchen she heard her son’s voice clea rly in her ear. “It was Aureliano, “ she shouted , 
running toward the chestnut tree to tell her husban d the news. “I don’t know how the miracle took  
place, but he’s alive and we’re going to see him very soon.” She took it for granted. She had the 
floors of the house scrubbed and changed the posit ion of the furniture. One week later a rumor  
from somewhere that was not supported by any pr oclamation gave dramatic confirmation to th e 
prediction. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been condemned to death and the sentence would be  
carried out in Macondo as a lesson to the popul ation. On Monday, at ten-thirty in the morning, 
Amaranta was dressing Aureliano José when she he ard the sound of a distant troop and the blast of 
a cornet one second before Úrsula burst into the r oom with the shout: “They’re bringing him now!” 
The troop struggled to subdue the overflowing c rowd with their rifle butts. Úrsula and Amaranta 
ran to th e corner, pushing their way through, and then they saw him. He looked like a beggar. His  
clothing was torn, his hair and beard were tangle d, and he was barefoot. He was walk ing without 
feeling the burning dust, his hands tied behind hi s back with  a rope th at a mounted  officer had  
attach ed to the head of his horse. Along with him,  also ragged and defeated, they were bringing 
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. They wer e not sad. They seem ed m ore disturbed by the cro wd that was 
shouting all kinds of insults at the troops. 
“My son!” Úrsula shouted in the midst of the up roar, and she slapped the soldier who tried to  
hold her back. The officer’s horse reared. Then  Colonel Aureliano Buendía stopped, tremulous, 
avoided the arms of his mother, and fixed a stern look on her eyes. 
“Go home, Mama,” he said. “Get permission from the author ities to come see me in jai l.” 
He looked at Amaranta, who stood  indecisively two steps  behind Úrsula, and he smil ed as h e 
asked her, “What happened to your hand?” Amaranta  raised the hand with the black bandage. “A  
burn,” she said, and took Úrsula away so that the horses would not run her down. The troop took  
off. A special guard surrounded the pr isoners and took them to the jail at a tr ot. 
At dusk Úrsula visited C olonel Aureliano Buendía in  jail. She had tried to get permission through 
Don Apolinar Moscote, but he had l ost all autho rity in the face of the mil itary omnipo tence. Father  
Nicanor was in bed with hepatic fever. The pare nts of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who had not 
been condemned to dea th, had tried to see him and were driven off with rifle butts. Facing th e 
impossibility of finding anyone to intervene, conv inced that h er son would be shot at da wn, Úrsula 
wrapped up the things she wanted to  bring him and went to th e jail alone. 
“I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendía,” she announced. 
The sentries blocked her way. “I’m going in in any case,” Úrsula warned them. “So if you have 
orders to shoot, start right in.” She pushed one of them aside and went into the former classroom , 
where a group of half-d ressed soldiers were oiling their weapons. An officer in a field uniform, 
ruddy-faced, with very thi ck glasses and ceremonio us manners, signaled to the sen tries to withdraw. 
“I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendía,” Úrsula repeated. 
 64GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“You must mean,” the o fficer corrected with a friendly smile, “that you are the moth er of Mister  
Aureliano B uendía.” Úrsula recognized in his affected  way of speaking th e languid ca dence of th e 
stuck-up people from the highlands. 
“As you say, mister ,” she a ccepted, “just as long as I can see him. ” 
There were superior orders that prohibited visits  to prisoners condemned to death, but the 
officer assumed the responsibility of letting her ha ve a fifteen- minute stay. Úrsula showed him what 
she had in the bundle: a change of clean clothi ng, the short boots that her son had worn at his 
wedding, and the sweet milk candy that she had kept for him since the day she had sensed his 
return. She found Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the room that was used as a cell, lying on a cot with 
his arms spread out beca use his armpits were paved with sores. They had allowed him to shave. The 
thick mustache with twisted ends accentuated the sharp angles of his cheekbones. He looked paler 
to Úrsula than when h e had left, a little taller, and more solitary than ever. He knew all about the 
details of the house: Pietro Crespi’s suicide, Arcadi o’s arbitrary acts and execution. the d auntlessnes s 
of José Arca dio Buendía underneath the chestnu t tree. He knew that Amar anta had con secrated h er 
virginal widowhood to th e rearing of Aureliano José  and that the latter was  beginning t o show signs 
of quite good judgment and that he had learned to re ad and write at the sam e time he h ad learned to  
speak. From the moment In which she entered the r oom Úrsula felt inhibited by the maturity of her 
son, by his aura of command, by the g low of author ity that radi ated from his skin. She was surprised 
that he was s o well-informed. “You knew all along that I was a wizard,” he joked. And he added in a 
serious tone, “This morning, when they brought me  here, I had the impression that I had alread y 
been through all that before.” In fact, while th e crowd was roaring alongside him, he had been 
concentra ting his thoughts, startled at how the to wn had aged . The leaves  of the almon d trees were 
broken. The houses, painted blue, then  painted red, had ended u p with an ind efinable coloration. 
“What did you expect?” Úrsula sighed. “Time passes.” 
“That’s how it goes,” Aureliano admitted, “but not so much.” 
In that wa y the long-awaited visit,  for wh ich both had  prepared que stions and had even 
anticipated answers, was once more the usual ev eryday conver sation. When the guard announced 
the end of the visit, Aureliano took out a roll of  sweaty pap ers from under the cot. They were his 
poetry, the p oems inspired by Remedi os, which he had taken with him wh en he left, and those he 
had written later on during chance pauses in the war. “Promise me that no one will re ad them,” he 
said. “Light the oven with them this very night. ” Úrsula prom ised and stood up to kiss him good-
bye. 
“I brought you a revolver,” she murmured. 
Colonel Aur eliano Buend ía saw that the sentry could not see. “It won’t do  me any good ,” he said 
in a low voice, “but give i t to me in ca se they search you on  the way out.” Ú rsula took th e revolver 
out of her bodice and pu t it under th e mattress of  the cot. “And don’t say good-bye,” he concluded  
with emphati c calmness. “Don’t beg or bow down to anyone. Pretend tha t they shot me a  long time 
ago.” Úrsula bit her lip so as not to cry. 
“Put some hot stones on those sores,” she said. 
She turned halfway around and left the room. Colonel Aureliano Buendía remained standing, 
thoughtful, until the do or closed. T hen he lay d own again with his arms open. Since the beginning 
of adolescence, when he had begun to be aware of  his premonitions, he thought that death would be 
announced with a d efinite, unequivocal, irrevoca ble signal, but there were only a few hours lef t 
before he would die and the signal had not come. On a certain occasion a v ery beautiful woman had  
come into hi s camp in Tu curinca and asked the se ntries’ permission to see him. They let her through 
because they were aware of the fanaticism of mother s, who sent their daughters to the bedrooms of 
the most fa mous warriors, according to wh at they  said, to improve the br eed. That night Colonel  
Aureliano Buendía was finishing the poem about the man who  is lost in the rain when the girl came 
 65GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
into his room. He turned his back to her to put the sheet of paper into the locked drawer where h e 
kept his poetry. And then he sensed it.  He grasped the pistol in the drawer without turning his head. 
“Please don’t shoot,” he said. 
When he tur ned around holding his Pistol, the gi rl had lowered hers and did not know what to 
do. In that way he had avoided four out of eleven traps. On  the other h and, someon e who wa s 
never caught entered the revolutionary headquarter s one night in Manaure and stabbed  to death his 
close friend Colonel Magnífico Visbal, to whom he had given his cot so that  he could s weat out a  
fever. A few yards away,  sleeping in a hammock in  the same room. he wa s not aware of anything. 
His efforts to systematize his premonitions were useless. The y would come suddenly in a wave o f 
supernatural lucidity, like an absolute a nd momenta neous conviction, but they could not be grasped.  
On occasion  they were s o natural tha t he identifi ed them as  premonitions only after th ey had b een 
fulfilled. Fre quently they were nothing but ordinary  bits of superstition. But when they condemn ed 
him to death and asked him to state his last wish, he did not have the least difficulty in identifying 
the premonition that inspired his answer. 
“I ask that th e senten ce be carried out in Macondo,” he said. 
The president of the court-martial was annoyed. “Don’t be clever, Buendía,”  he told him. 
“That’s just a trick to gain more time. ” 
“If you don’t  fulfill it, that will be your worry.”  the colonel said, “but that’s my last wish.” 
Since then the premonitions had abandoned him. Th e day wh en Úrsula visited him in jail, after a 
great deal of  thinking he came to th e conclusi on that perhaps death would  not be announced that 
time because it did not depend on chance but on the will of his executioners. He spent the night  
awake, torm ented by th e pain of his sores. A li ttle before d awn he hear d steps in the hallway. 
“They’re coming,” he said to himself, and for no reason he thought of José Arcadio Buendía, who at 
that mo ment was thinkin g about him  under the d reary dawn of the ches tnut tree. He did not feel  
fear or nostalgia, but an intestinal rage at the idea  that this artificial death would not let him see th e 
end of so ma ny things tha t he had  left unfinished. The door op ened and a s entry ca me in with a  mug  
of coffee. On the following day at the same hour  he would still be doing wh at he was then, raging 
with the pai n in his armpits, and the same thing happened. O n Thursday he shared the sweet milk  
candy with the guards and put on his clean clothes , which were tight for him, and the p atent lea ther 
boots. By Friday they had still not shot him. 
Actually, they did not d are carry out the sentence. The rebelliousness of the town made the 
military men think that the execution of Colonel Aureliano Buendía might have serious political 
consequences not only in Macondo but throughout the area  of the swamp, so they consulted th e 
authorities i n the capital  of the province. On  Saturd ay night, while they were waiting f or an answer 
Captain Roque Carnicero went with some other o fficers to Catarino’s place. Only o ne woman,  
practically th reatened, dar ed take him  to her room.  “They don’t want to go to bed with a man they 
know is going to die,” s he confessed to him. “No one knows how it will come, but everybody is 
going around saying that the officer who shoots Colonel Aureliano Buendía and all the soldiers in 
the squad, one by one, will be murd ered, with no escape, sooner or later, even if they hide at the 
ends of the earth.” Captain Roque Carnicero mentioned it to  the other officers and they told their  
superiors. On Sunday, although no one had revealed it openly, although no action on the part of the 
military had disturbed the tense calm of those da ys, the whole town knew  that the officers were 
ready to us e any manner of pretext to avoid res ponsibility for the execution. The official orde r 
arrived in th e Monday m ail: the execu tion was  to be carried ou t within twenty-four hours. That night 
the officers put seven slips of paper into a cap, and Captain R oque Carnicero’s unpeaceful fate was 
foreseen by his name on the prize slip. “Bad luck doesn’t have any chinks in it,” he said with deep 
bitterness. “I was born a  son of a bitch  and I’m going to die a s on of a bitch .” At five in the morning 
 66GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
he chose the squad by lot, formed it in the courtyard, and woke up the condemned man with a  
premonitory phrase. 
“Let’s go, Buendía,” he told him. “Our time has co me.” 
“So that’s what it was,” the colonel replied. “I was dreaming that my sores h ad burst.” 
Rebeca Buendía got up at three in the morning when she lea rned that Au reliano would be shot. 
She stayed  in the bedroo m in the dar k, watching the cem etery wall through the half-opened windo w 
as the bed on which she sat shook with José Arca dio’s snoring. She had wa ited all week with the  
same hidden  persistence with which during different times she had wa ited f or Pietro Crespi’s letters.  
“They won’t shoot him here,” José Arcadio, told he r. “They’ll shoot him at midnight in the barracks  
so that no one will know who made up the squad,  and they’ll bury him right there.” Rebeca kept on 
waiting. “They’re stupid enough to s hoot him he re,” she said. She was so certain that she had  
foreseen the way she wo uld open th e door to  wave good-bye. “They won’ t bring him through the 
streets,” José Arca dio in sisted, with six scared so ldiers and knowing that the peo ple are ready for  
anything.” In different to her husband’s logic, Rebeca stayed by the window.  
“You’ll see that they’re just stupid eno ugh,” she said. 
On Tuesday,  at five-in the. morning, José Arcadio had drunk his coffee and let the d ogs out 
when Reb eca closed the window and held onto th e head of the bed so as not to fall d own. “There, 
they’re bringing him,” she sighed. “He’s so hand some.” José Arcadio looked out the window and 
saw him. tremulous in the light of dawn. He alrea dy had his b ack to th e wall and his hands were o n 
his hips because the burning knots in his armpits would not let him lower them. “A person fucks 
himself up so much,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía said . “Fucks himself up  so much just so that six  
weak fairies can kill him  and he can’t do anything about it.” He  repeated it with so much rage that it 
almost seem ed to be fervor, and Captain Roque Carnicero was touched, because he tho ught he was  
praying. When the squad took aim, the rage had m aterialized into a viscous and bitter substance tha t 
put his tongue to sleep and made hi m close his e yes. Then th e aluminum glow of dawn disappeared  
and he saw himself again in short pants, wearing a tie around his neck, and he saw his fat her leading 
him into the tent on a splendid afternoon, and he sa w the ice. When he heard the shou t he thought 
that it was  the final co mmand to  the squad. H e opened  his eyes  with  a shudder o f curiosity, 
expecting to meet the incandescent trajectory of the bullets, but he only saw Captain Roqu e 
Carnicero with his arms in the air an d José Arca dio crossing the street with his fearsome shotgun 
ready to go off. 
“Don’t shoot,” the captai n said to José Arca dio. “You were sent by Divine Providence.” 
Another war  began right  there. Captain Roque Carnicero and his six men left with Colonel 
Aureliano B uendía to  free the revolutionary genera l Victorio Medina, who had been condemned to 
death in  Riohacha. They thought they could save time  by crossing the moun tains along the trail th at 
José Arcadi o Buendía h ad followed to found Macondo, but before a week was  out they wer e 
convinced th at it was an i mpossible u ndertaking. So  they had  to follow the dangerous route over the 
outcroppings; with no other muni tions but what the firing squad had. They would camp near  the 
towns and o ne of them, with a small gold fish in hi s hand, would go in disguise in broa d daylight to 
contact the dormant Liberals, who would go ou t hunting on the following morning and never 
return. When they saw R iohacha from a ridge in th e mountai ns, General Victorio Medina had bee n 
shot. Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s men proclai med him ch ief of the revolutionary forces of the 
Caribbean coast with the rank of ge neral. He assumed the position but refused the promotion and  
took the stand that he would never accept it as l ong as the Cons ervative regime was in power. At the 
end of three months they had succeed ed in arming  more than a thousand men, but they were wiped  
out. The survivors reached the easter n frontier. The next thing that was heard of them was that they  
had landed on Cabo de la Vela, coming from the sm aller islands of the Antilles, and a message from 
the government was sen t all over by telegraph and included in jubilant proclamations thro ughout the 
 67GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
country ann ouncing the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. But two days later a multiple telegram 
which almos t overtook the previous one announced another uprising on t he southern plains. That 
was how the legend of the ubiquitous Colonel Aureliano Buendía, began. Simultaneous and 
contradictory information declared him victorious in  Villanueva. defeated in Guacamayal, devoured 
by Motilón Indians, dead in a village in the swam p, and up in arms again in Urumita. The Liberal 
leaders, who  at th at m oment were negotiating fo r participati on in the congress, branded him in 
adventurer who did not represent the party. The n ational government placed him in the category o f 
a bandit and put a price o f five thousand pesos on his head. After sixteen defeats, Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía left Guajira with two thous and well-arme d Indians and the garrison, which was taken by 
surprise as it  slept, abandoned Riohacha. He esta blished his headquarters there and proclaimed total  
war against the regime. The first message he recei ved from the government was a threat to sho ot 
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez within f orty-eight hours if  he did not withdr aw with his forces to the 
eastern frontier. Colonel Roque Carnicero, who was his chief of staff then, gave him the telegra m 
with a look of consternati on, but he read it with un foreseen joy. 
“How wonderful!” he exclaimed. “We ha ve a tel egraph office in Macondo now.” 
His reply wa s definitive. In three mo nths he ex pected to es tablish his head quarters in Macondo. 
If he did not find Colonel Gerineldo Márquez alive at  that time he would s hoot out of hand all of  
the officers he held prisoner at that moment starti ng with the generals, and he would give orders to 
his subordinates to do the same for the rest of the war. Three months  later, when he entered 
Macondo in triumph, the first embrace he receive d on the swamp road was that of Colonel Geri-
neldo Márquez. 
The house was full of children. Úrsula had taken in Santa Sofía de la Piedad with her older  
daughter and  a pair of twi ns, who had been born fi ve months af ter Arcadio had been shot. Contrar y 
to the victim ’s last wishes, she baptized the girl with the nam e of Remedios. I’m sure that was wh at 
Arcadio mea nt,” she alleged. “We won ’t call her Úrsula, because a person suffers too much with tha t 
name.” The twins were n amed José Arcadio Segund o and Aureliano Segundo. Amaranta took care 
of them all. She put sma ll wooden chairs in the l iving room and establish ed a nursery with oth er 
children fro m neighboring families. When Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned in the midst of 
exploding ro ckets and ringing bells, a children’s chorus welcom ed him to th e house. Aureliano José,  
tall like his grandfather, dressed as a revo lutionary officer, gave him military honors. 
Not all the news was go od. A year a fter the flig ht of Colonel Aureliano B uendía, José Arcadio 
and Rebeca went to live in the house Arcadio had built. No one knew about his intervention to halt 
the execution. In the new house, located on the best corner of the square, in the shade of an almond 
tree that was  honored by three nests of redbreasts, with a large door for visitors and four windows  
for light, they set up a hospitable home. Rebeca’ s old friends, among them four of the Moscote 
sisters who were still single, once more took up  the sessions of em broidery that had been 
interrupted years before on the porch  with the b egonias. José Arcadio con tinued to pro fit from the 
usurped lands, the title to which was recognized  by the Conservative government. Every afternoon 
he could be s een returning on horseback, with his hunting dogs and his dou ble-barreled shotgun and  
a string of ra bbits hanging from his saddle. One Se ptember afternoon, with the threat of a storm, he 
returned home earlier than usual. He greeted Rebeca in the dining room, t ied the dogs up in the 
courtyard, h ung the rabb its up in the kitchen to b e salted l ater, and went to  the b edroom to ch ange 
his clothes. Rebeca la ter declared tha t when he r husband went into the b edroom she wa s locked in 
the bathroom and did not hear anything. It was a difficult version to believe, but there was no other 
more plausible, and no one could thi nk of any moti ve for Rebeca to murder the man who had ma de 
her happy. That was  perhaps the only mystery that  was never cleared u p in Macond o. As soon as  
José Arcadio  closed the bedroom door the soun d of a pistol shot echoed through the house. A 
trickle of blood came o ut under the door, crossed the living room, went out into  the street,  
 68GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
continued o n in a straigh t line across the uneven  terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs,  
passed along the Street o f the Turks, turned a cor ner to the ri ght and another to the left, made a  
right angle at the Buendía house, went in under the closed door, crossed through the parlor, hugging 
the walls so as not to s tain the rugs, went on  to the other  living room, ma de a wide cu rve to avoid 
the dining-room table, went along the porch with the begonias, and passed without being seen under 
Amaranta’s chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson  to Aureliano José , and went through the pantry 
and came ou t in the kitch en, where Úrsula was getti ng ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread. 
“Holy Mother of God!” Úrsula shouted. 
She followed the thread  of blood back along its course, and in search of its origin she went 
through the pantry, along the begonia porch where Aureliano José was chan ting that three plus three 
is six and six plus three is nine, and she crossed the dining room and the li ving rooms and followed  
straight down the s treet, and she turned first to th e right and then to  the left to the Street of th e 
Turks, forgetting that she was still w earing her b aking apron  and her house slippers, a nd she came 
out onto the square and went into the door of a house where she had never been, and she pushed  
open the bedroom door and was almost suffoc ated by the smell of burned gunpowder, and she 
found José Arcadio lying face down on the ground on top of the leggings he had just taken off, and 
she saw the starting point of the thread of blood that had alread y stopped flowing out of his right 
ear. They found no wound on his body nor could they loca te the weapon . Nor was it possible to  
remove the smell of powder from the corpse. First they was hed him three times with soap and a  
scrubbing brush, and they rubbed him with salt and vinegar, then with ashes and lemon, and finally  
they put him  in a barrel of lye and let him stay fo r six hours. They scrubb ed him so m uch that the 
arabesques of his tattooing began to fade. When th ey thought of the desperate measure of seasoning 
him with pepper, cumin seeds, and laurel leaves a nd boiling him for a  whole day over a slow fire, he 
had already begun to decompose and they had to bury him hastily. They sealed him hermetically in a  
special coffin seven and  a half feet l ong and four feet wide, reinforced inside with iron plates an d 
fastened tog ether with steel bolts, an d even then the smell co uld be perceived on the streets through 
which the funeral procession passed. Father Nicanor , with his liver enlarged and tight as a drum,  
gave him his blessing from bed. Although in th e months that followed they reinforced the grave 
with walls ab out it, between which they threw com pressed ash, sawdust, and  quicklime, the cemeter y 
still smelled of powder for many years after, until the engineers from the banana company covered 
the grave over with a shell of concrete. As soon as  they took the body out,  Rebeca clos ed the doors 
of her house and buried herself alive, covered with  a thick crust of disdain that no earthl y temp tation  
was ever abl e to break. S he went out into the st reet on one o ccasion, when  she was ver y old, with 
shoes the col or of old silver and a hat made of tiny  flowers, during the time that th e Wan dering Jew 
passed through town and brought on a heat wave that was so intense that birds broke through 
window screens to com e to die in the bedrooms. Th e last time anyone sa w her alive was  when with  
one shot she killed a thief who was trying to force the door of her house. Except for Argénida, her 
servant and confidante, no one ever  had any mo re contact with her after that. At one time it was 
discovered that she was writing letter s to th e Bish op, whom s he claimed  as a first cous in. but it was 
never said whether she received any reply. The town forgot about her. 
In spite of his triumphal return, Colonel Aureliano  Buendía was not enthu siastic over the looks  
of things. The government troops abandoned their positions without resistance and that aroused an 
illusion of victory among the Liberal population th at it was not right to destr oy, but the 
revolutionaries knew the truth, Colonel Aureliano Buendía better than any of them. Although at tha t 
moment he had more than five thousand men  under his co mmand and  held two  coastal states, h e 
had the feeling of being hemmed in against the s ea and caught in a situa tion that was  so confused  
that when  he ordered th e restoration o f the chur ch steeple, which had b een k nocked down by army 
cannon fire, Father Nicanor commented from his sickbed:  “This is silly; the defenders of the faith of 
 69GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Christ destroy the church and th e Masons order it rebuilt.” Looking for a loophole thr ough which 
he could es cape, he sp ent hours on end in the tel egraph office conferring with the co mmanders o f 
other towns,  and every time he would emerge with the firmest impression that the war was at a  
stalemate. When news  of fresh liberal victories was received it was celebrated with jubilant 
proclamatio ns, but he would measure the real ex tent of them  on the map  and could see tha t his 
forces were penetrating into the jungle, defend ing themsel ves against malaria and mosquitoes, 
advancing in the opposite direction f rom reality. “W e’re wasti ng time,” he would complain to his  
officers. “We’re wasting time while th e bastards in  the party are begging for seats in congress.” Lying 
awake a t night, stretch ed out on his back in a hammock in the same room where he had awaited  
death, he would evoke the image of  lawyers dressed in black leaving th e presidential palace in the icy 
cold of early morning with their coa t collars turned up about their ears, rubbing their hands, whis-
pering, taking refuge in dreary early-morning ca fés to specula te over what th e president had mean t 
when he sai d yes, or wh at he ha d meant when h e said no, an d even  to im agine what the president 
was thinking when he said something quite differe nt, as he chased away mosquitoes at a temperatur e 
of ninety-five degrees, feeling the approach of the fearsome dawn when he would have to give his 
men the com mand to jum p into the sea. 
One night of uncertainty, when Pilar Ternera was singing in the courtyard  with the soldiers, he 
asked her to read the future in her cards. “Watch  out for your mouth,” wa s all that Pilar Ternera  
brought out after spreading and picking up the ca rds three tim es. “I don’t know what it means, bu t 
the sign is very clear. Watch out for your mouth. ” Two days later someone gave an orderly a mug of 
black coffee and the orderly passed it on to someo ne else and that one to s omeone else until, hand 
to hand, it reached Colonel Aureliano Buendía office.  He had not asked for any coffee, but since it 
was there the colonel drank it. It had a dose of nu x vomica strong enough to kill a horse. When they  
took him ho me he was s tiff and arched and his tongue was s ticking out b etween his teeth. Úrsula  
fought against death over him. Af ter cleaning out his stomach with emetics, she wrapped him in hot 
blankets an d fed him egg whites for two days  until his harrowed b ody recover ed its norm al 
temperature.  On the fourth day he was out of dang er. Against his will, pres sured by Úrs ula and his 
officers, he stayed in  bed for another week. Onl y then did h e learn th at his verses had not b een 
burned. “I didn’t want to  be hasty,” Úrsula explai ned to him. “That night when I went to light the 
oven I said to myself th at it would b e better to  wait until th ey brought the body.” In  the haze of 
convalescence, surrounded by Remedi os’ dusty do lls, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, brought back the 
decisive periods of his existence by reading his poetry. He s tarted writing again. For many hours,  
balancing on the edge of  the surprises of a war wi th no  future, in rhymed verse he resolved his  
experience o n the shores of death. Then his thoughts became so clear that he was abl e to examine 
them forward and backward. One night he asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez: 
“Tell me something, old friend: why are you fighting?” 
“What other reason could there be?” Colonel Gerine ldo Márquez answered. “For the great liberal 
party.” 
“You’re lucky because you know wh y,” he answer ed. “As fa r as I’m con cerned, I’ve come to  
realize only j ust now that I’m fighting because of p ride.” 
“That’s bad,” Colonel G erineldo Márquez said . Colonel Aureliano Buendía was amused at his 
alarm. “Naturally,” he said. “But in any case, it’s  better than n ot knowing why you’re fighting.” He 
looked him in the eyes an d added with  a smile: 
“Or fighting, like you, for something that doesn’t h ave any mea ning for anyone.” 
His pride had prevented him from making contact with the ar med groups in the interior of the 
country until the leaders of the party publicly recti fied their declaration th at he was a bandit. He 
knew, however, that as s oon as he put those scru ples aside he would break the vicious circle of the 
war. Convalescence gave him time to reflect. Then he succeeded in getting Úrsula to give him the 
 70GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
rest of her buried inheritance and her substanti al savings. He named Colonel Gerineldo Márquez 
civil and military leader o f Macondo and he went o ff to make contact with  the rebel groups in the 
interior. 
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was  not only the ma n closest to Colonel Au reliano Buendía, but 
Úrsula received him as a member of the family. Frag ile, timid, with natural good manners, he was, 
however, better suited for war than for government. His political advisers easily entan gled him in 
theoretical l abyrinths, But he succeeded in givi ng Macondo the atmosphere of rural peace tha t 
Colonel Aur eliano, Buendía dreamed  of so that he could die of old age making little gold fishes. 
Although he lived in his parents’ hou se he woul d have lunch at Úrsula’s two or three times a week. 
He initiated Aureliano José in the use of firearms, gave him ear ly military instruction, and for several 
months took him to live in the barracks, with Úr sula’s consent, so that he could become a man. 
Many years before, when he was still almost a ch ild, Gerineldo Márquez had declared his love for 
Amaranta. At that time s he was so illusioned with her lonely passion for Pietro Crespi that she 
laughed at him. Gerineldo Márquez waited. On a cer tain occasion he sent Amaranta a note from jail  
asking her to embroider a dozen batis te handkerchi efs with his father’s initials on them. He sent her 
the money. A week later  Amaranta, brought the doze n hand kerchiefs to him in jail along with the 
money and they spent s everal hours talking about th e past. “ When I get out of here I’m going to  
marry you,” Gerineldo Márquez told her when she left. Amaranta laughed but she kept on thinking 
about him  while she ta ught the chi ldren to rea d and she tr ied to revive her juvenile passion for 
Pietro Crespi. On Saturday, visiting days for the prisoners, she would stop by the house of  
Gerineldo Márquez’s parents and acco mpany them  to the jail. On one of t hose Saturda ys Úrsula wa s 
surprised to see her in  the kitchen, wa iting for the bi scuits to come out of th e oven so  that she coul d 
pick the best ones and ca p them in a napkin that s he had embr oidered for the occasion.  
“Marry him,” she told her. “You’ll ha ve a hard time finding another man like him.” 
Amaranta fei gned a reacti on of displeasure. 
“I don’t ha ve to go around hunting for men,” she answered. “I’m taking these biscuits to 
Gerineldo because I’m sorry that sooner or later they’re going to shoot him.” 
She said it without thinki ng, but that was the ti me that the government had  announced  its threat 
to shoot Colonel Gerineldo Márquez if the rebel forces did not surrender Riohacha. The visits 
stopped. Amaranta shut h erself up to weep, overwhelme d by a feeling of guilt similar to the one that 
had tormented her when  Remedios d ied, as if on ce more her  careless words had been responsible  
for a death. Her mother consoled her. She in ured her that Colonel Aureliano Buendía would do 
something to  prevent th e execution an d promised that  she would take ch arge of attracting  Gerineldo  
Márquez herself when the war was o ver. She fulfilled her promise before the imagined time. When  
Gerineldo Márquez returned to the house, invested wi th his new dignity of civil and military leader, 
she received him as a son, thought of delightful bits of flattery to hold him there, and prayed with all  
her soul that he would remember his plan to marry  Amaranta. Her pleas seemed to b e answered. On 
the days tha t he would have lunch at the ho use, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez would linger on the 
begonia porch playing Chinese check ers with Amar anta. Úrsula would bring them coffee and milk  
and biscuits and would take over the children so  that they wo uld not both er them. Am aranta was  
really making an effort to kindle in her heart th e forgotten ashes of her youthful passion. With an 
anxiety that came to be intolerable, she waited for the lunch days, the afternoons of Chinese 
checkers, and time flew by in the company of th e warrior with a nostalgic name who se fingers 
trembled imperceptibly a s he moved the pieces. But the day on which Colonel Gerineldo Márquez 
repeated his wish to marry her, she rejected him. 
“I’m not going to marry anyone,” she told hi m, “much less you. You love Aureliano so much 
that you wan t to marry m e because yo u can’t marry him.” 
 71GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was  a patient man. “I’ ll keep on ins isting,” he said. “Sooner or later  
I’ll convince  you.” He kept on visiting the house. Shut up in her bedroom biting back her secret 
tears, Amara nta put her fingers in her ears so as not  to bear the voice of the suitor as he gave Úrsula 
the latest wa r news, and in spite of the fact that sh e was dying to see him she had the strength not to  
go out and meet him. 
At that time Colonel Aureliano Buendía took the time to sen d a detailed account to Macondo 
every two weeks. But only once, almost eight months  after he had left, did he write to Úrsula. A  
special messenger brought a sealed envelope to th e house with a sheet of paper inside bearing th e 
colonel’s delicate hand: Take good care of Papa because he is going to die . Úrsula becam e alarmed. “If 
Aureliano says so it’s be cause Aureliano knows,” sh e said. A nd she had them help her take Jos é 
Arcadio Buendía to his bedroom. Not only was he as  heavy as ever, but during his prolonged stay 
under the chestnut tree he had developed the faculty of being able to increase his weight at will, to 
such a degree that s even men were u nable to lift him and they had to dra g him to the bed. A smel l 
of tender mushrooms, of wood-flow er fungus, of  old and concentrated outdoors impregnated the 
air of the b edroom as it was brea thed by the colossal old ma n wea ther-beaten  by the sun and  the 
rain. The next morning he was  not in his bed. I n spite of his undiminished strength, José Arcadi o 
Buendía was in no condition to resist. It was all the same to him. If he went back to the chestnut 
tree it was n ot because h e wanted to but because of a habit of his body. Úrsula took care of him, fed 
him, brought him news of Aurelia no. But actually, the onl y person wi th whom he was  able to hav e 
contact for a long time was Prudencio Aguilar. Almost  pulverized at th at time by the d ecrepitude of 
death, Prudencio Aguilar would com e twice a d ay to chat wi th him. They talked abo ut fighting 
cocks. They promised each other to set up a breed ing farm for magnifice nt birds, not  so much to 
enjoy their victories, which they wou ld not need then, as to have somethi ng to do on the tedious 
Sundays of death. It was Prudencio Aguilar wh o cleaned him fed him a nd brought him splendid 
news of an unknown person calle d Aureliano who was a col onel in the war. When he was  alone, 
José Arcadio  Buendía co nsoled himself with the dr eam of th e infinite rooms. He dreamed th at he 
was getting out of bed, o pening the d oor and going into an id entical room with th e sam e bed with  a 
wrought-iron head, the same wicker chair, and the same small picture of t he Virgin of Help on the 
back wall. From that room he would go into another that was just the same, the do or of which 
would open i nto another that was just the same, th e door of which would open into another one just 
the same, an d then into another exactly alike, and so on to infinity. He liked to go from room to 
room. As in a gallery of paralle l mirrors, until Prudencio Agu ilar would to uch him on  the shoulder.  
Then he would go back from room to room, wal king in reverse, going back over his trail, and he 
would find Prudencio Aguilar in the room of rea lity. But one night, two weeks after th ey took him  
to his bed, Prudencio Aguilar touched his shoulder  in an intermediate ro om and he stayed th ere 
forever, thinking that it was the real room. On the following morning Úrsula was bringing him  his 
breakfast when she saw a  man comin g along the hall.  He was short and stocky, with a black suit on 
and a ha t that was  also black, enormous, pulled down to  his taciturn eyes. “Good Lord,” Úrsula  
thought, “I could have s worn it was Melquíades.” It  was Cataure, Visitación’s brother, who had l eft 
the house fleeing from the insomnia p lague and of  whom th ere had never been any news.  Visitació n 
asked him why he had co me back, an d he an swered her in their solemn language: 
“I have come for the exequies of the king.” 
Then they went into José Arcadio Bu endía’s room , shook him as hard as they could, shouted in 
his ear, put a mirror in front of his nostrils, but th ey could not a waken him. A short tim e later, when  
the carpenter was taking measuremen ts for the co ffin, through the window they saw a l ight rain of  
tiny yellow flowers fallin g. They fell on the town a ll through the night in a silent storm, and they 
covered the roofs and blocked the d oors and smot hered the animals who  dept outdo ors. So many 
 72GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets were carpeted with a compact cushion an d 
they had to clear them away with shov els and rakes so that th e funeral procession could pass by.

SITT NG IN T HE WIC KER RO CKING  chair with her interrupted work in her lap, Amara nta watched 
Aureliano, José , his chi n covered with foam, stro pping his razor to give himself his first shave. Hi s 
blackheads bled and he cut his upper lip as he tr ied to shape a mustache of blond fuzz and when it 
was all over he looked the same as before, but th e laborious process gave Amaranta the feeling that 
she had begun to grow old at that moment. 
“You look just like Aureliano when he was your age,” she said. “You’re a man now.” 
He had been for a lon g time, ever since that distant day when Amaranta thought he was still a  
child and co ntinued getti ng undressed in front of him in the bathroom as  she had always done, as  
she had been used to doing ever since Pilar Tern era had turned him over to her to finish his  
upbringing. The first time that he saw her th e only thing that drew hi s attention was the deep  
depression between her breasts. He was so innocent that he asked her what had hap pened to her  
and Amaran ta pretended  to dig into her breasts wi th the tips  of her fingers and answered: “They 
gave me some terrible cuts.” Some time later, wh en she had recovered from Pietro Crespi’s suicide 
and would bathe with Au reliano José again, he no l onger paid attention to the depression but felt a  
strange trembling at the sight of the splendid breasts with their brown nipples. He kept on 
examining her, discovering the miracle of her intimacy inch  by inch, and h e felt his skin tingle as h e 
contempla ted the wa y her skin tingled when it tou ched the water. Ever since he was a s mall child he 
had the custom of leaving his hammock and waking up in Amaranta’s bed, because con tact with her 
was a way of  overcoming his fear of the dark. But since that da y when he b ecame a ware of his own 
nakedness, it was not fear  of the dark that drov e him to crawl i n under her mosquito netting but an 
urge to feel Amaranta’s  warm breathing at da wn. Early one morning during the time when sh e 
refused Colonel Gerinel do Márquez, Aureliano José  awoke with the feeling that he could not 
breathe. He felt Amara nta’s fingers searchin g across his stomach like warm and anxious littl e 
caterpillars. Pre tending to sleep, he changed his positi on to make it easier, and then he felt the hand  
without the black banda ge diving like a blind shellf ish into the algae of his anxiety. Although they 
seemed to ignore what b oth of them  knew and what ea ch one knew th at the other knew, from that  
night on they were yoked togeth er in an inviolable  complicity.  Aureliano J osé could no t get to  sleep  
until he heard the twelve-o’clock waltz on the parlor dock, and the mature maiden who se skin was 
beginning to grow sad did not have a moments’ rest until she felt s lip in under her mosquito netting  
that sleepwalker whom she had raised, not thinking that he would be a palliative for h er solitude. 
Later they n ot only slep t together, nak ed, exchangi ng exhausting caresses, b ut they woul d also chase 
each o ther in to the corner s of the hous e and shut themselves up in the b edrooms at any h our of the 
day in a  permanent s tate of unrelieved excitem ent. They were almost di scovered by Úrsula one  
afternoon when she went into the granary as they wer e starti ng to kiss. “Do you love your aunt a 
lot?” she asked Aureliano  José in an i nnocent way. He answered that h e did. “That’s good of you,” 
Úrsula concluded and finished measu ring the flour for the bread and retur ned to the ki tchen. Tha t 
episode drew Amaran ta out of her delirium. She rea lized tha t she had gon e too far, tha t she was  no 
longer playing kissing games with a child, but wa s floundering about in an autumnal  passion, one  
that was d angerous and had no future, and she cut it off with one stroke. Aureliano José, who was 
then finishing his military training, fin ally woke up  to reality and went to sl eep in the barracks. On  
Saturdays he would go with the sol diers to Cata rino’s store. He was seeking consolation for his 
abrupt solitude, for his premature ad olescence wi th women who smelled of dead flowers, whom he 
idealized in the darkness  and changed into Am aranta by means of the anxious effo rts of his 
imagination. 
 74GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
A short time later contra dictory news  of the war began to come in. While the government itself  
admitted the progress of the rebellion, the officer s in Macondo had confidential reports of the  
imminence o f a negotiated peace. Toward the first of April a special emissary  identified himself to 
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. He confirmed the fact to  him th at the lead ers of the party had indeed  
established contact with  the rebel  leaders in th e interior and were on  the verge of arranging an 
armistice in exchange fo r three cabi net posts  for the Libera ls, a minority representa tion in th e 
congress, and a general amnesty for r ebels who lai d down th eir arms. The emissary brought a highly 
confidential order from Colonel Aureliano Buend ía, who was not in agreement with  the terms of th e 
armistice. Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was to choose five of his best men an d prepare to leave th e 
country with  them. The order would be carried ou t with the strictest secrecy. One week before the 
agreement was announced, and in the midst of a storm of contradictory rumors, Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía and ten trusted  officers, among them Colonel Roque Carnicero, stealthily arrived in 
Macondo after midnight, dismissed the garrison, bu ried their weapons, and destroyed their records. 
By dawn they had left to wn, along with Colonel G erineldo Márquez and his five officers. It was such 
a quick and secret operation that Ú rsula did not find out about it until the last moment, when  
someone tapped on her bedroom window and whispe red, “If you want to see Colon el Aureliano  
Buendía, co me to  the do or right now.” Úrsula Jumped  out of bed and went to the door i n her night-
gown and she was just ab le to see the horsemen who were leaving town gallop off in a mute cloud 
of dust. Only on the following day did she discover that Aurel iano José had gone with his father. 
Ten days after a joint communiqué by the gove rnment and  the opposition announced  the end of 
the war, there was news of the first armed up rising of Colonel Aureliano Buendía on the western 
border. His small and p oorly armed  force was s cattered in less than a week. But during that year, 
while Liberals and Conservatives tried to make th e country believe in reco nciliation, he attempted  
seven other revolts. One night he bombarded Riohacha from a schooner and the garrison dragged  
out of bed  and shot the fourteen bes t-known Liberals  in the town as  a rep risal. For more than  two 
weeks he hel d a customs  post on  the border and from there s ent th e nation a call to g eneral war.  
Another of his expecta tions was lost for three mo nths in th e jungle in a m ad attempt to cross more 
than a thousand miles of virgin te rritory in order to proclaim war on the outskirts of the capital. On  
one occasion he was lea  than fifteen  miles away  from Macondo and was obliged by governmen t 
patrols to hide in the mo untains, very close to the enchanted region where his father had found the 
fossil of a Spanish galleon many years before. 
Visitación died around that time. She had the pleasure of dy ing a natural death after having  
renounced a throne out of fear of insomnia, and he r last wish was that th ey should dig up the wages  
she had saved for more than twenty years unde r her bed and s end the money to Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía so that he could go on wi th the war. But Úrsula did not bothe r to dig it up because i t was 
rumored in those days that Colonel Aureliano Bue ndía had been killed in a landin g near the 
provincial capital. The official announcement— the fourth in less than two years—was considered 
true for alm ost six months because nothing furt her was heard of him. Suddenly, when Úrsula and 
Amaranta ha d added new mourning to the past pe riod, unexpected news ar rived. Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía was  alive, but apparently he had stopped  harassing the government of his country and had  
joined with the victorious federalism of other repu blics of the Caribbean. He would show up under  
different names farther and farther away from his own country. Later it would be learned that th e 
idea that wa s working on him at the time was the unification of the federalist forms of Central  
America in  order to wip e out conser vative regimes from Alas ka to Patago nia. The first direct n ews 
that Úrsula r eceived from  him, several years after h is departure, was a wrinkled and faded  letter that 
had arrived, passing through vari ous hands, from Santiago, Cuba. 
“We’ve lost him forever, ” Úrsula exc laimed on read ing it. “If he follows this path he’ll spend 
Christmas at the ends of the earth.” 
 75GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
The person to whom she said it, who was the first to whom she showed the letter, was th e 
Conservative general José Raquel Moncada, mayor of Macondo since the end of the war. “This 
Aureliano,” General Moncada commented, “what a pity that he’s not a Conservative.” He reall y 
admired him. Like many Conservative civilians, José Raquel Moncada had waged war in defense of 
his party and had earned the title of general on the field o f battle, even though he was n ot a military 
man by profession. On the contrar y, like so ma ny of his fellow party members,  he was an 
antimilitarist. He considered military men unprincipl ed loafers, ambitious plotters, experts in facing 
down civilians in order to prosper during times of  disorder. Intelligent, pleasant, ruddy-faced, a man 
who liked to  eat and watch cockfights, he h ad been  at one time the mos t feared adversary of Colonel  
Aureliano Buendía. He succeeded in imposing his author ity over the career  officers in a wide sector  
along the coast. One time when he was forced by  strategic circumstances to abandon a stronghold 
to the forces of Colonel Aureliano B uendía, he left two letters  for him. In one of them  quite long, he 
invited him to join in a  campaign to m ake war more human e. The other  letter was for hi s wife, wh o 
lived in Liberal territory, and he left i t with a  plea to see that it reached i ts destination. From then on, 
even in the bloodiest periods of the war, the two command ers would arrange truces to exchange 
prisoners. They were p auses with a  certain fest ive atmosphere, which General Moncada took 
advantage of to teach Colonel Aureliano Buendía how to play chess. They becam e great friends. 
They even came to think about the possibility of c oordinating the popular elements of both parties,  
doing away with the influence of the military me n and professional politicians, and setting up a 
humanitarian  regime that would take the best from each doctrine. When the war was over, while 
Colonel Aur eliano, Buendía was sneaking about through the narrow tr ails of permanent sub. 
version, General Moncada was name d magistrate of Macondo. He wore  civilian clothes, replaced the 
soldiers with unarmed policemen, enforced the amnesty laws,  and helped a few familie s of Liberals  
who had been killed in  the war. He succeeded  in having Macondo raised to the status of a 
municipality and he was therefore its first mayor, and he created an atmosp here of confidence that 
made people think of the war as an absurd nightmare of the past. Father Nicanor, consumed by 
hepatic fever , was replaced by Father Coronel, whom  they call ed “The Pup,” a veteran  of the first 
federalist war. Bruno Crespi, who was married to Amparo Mos. cote, and whose shop of toys and 
musical instruments conti nued to prosper, built a theater which  Spanish co mpanies incl uded in th eir 
Itineraries. It  was a vast open-air hall with wooden  benches, a velvet curtain with Greek masks, and 
three box of fices in the s hape of lion s’ heads, thr ough whose mouths th e tickets were s old. It was 
also about that time that the s chool was rebuilt . It was put under the charge of Don Melchor  
Escalona, an  old teach er brought from the swam p, who made his lazy stu dents walk o n their knees  
in the lime-coated courtyard and made the students who talked in class  eat hot chili with the 
approval of their parents. Aureliano Segundo and  José Arcadio Segundo, t he willful twins of Santa 
Sofía de la Piedad, were the first to  sit in the cl assroom, with their slates, their chal k, and thei r 
aluminum jugs with their names on them. Remedios , who inherited her mother’s pure beauty, began 
to be known as Remedios the Beauty.  In spite of  time, of the superimposed Periods of mourning, 
and her accu mulated afflictions, Úrsula resisted grow ing old. Aided by Santa Sofía de la Piedad, she  
gave a new drive to her pastry business and in a few years not only recovered the fortune that her 
son had spent in the war, but she once more stuffed with pure gold the gourds buried in the 
bedroom. “As long as God gives me life,” sh e woul d say, “there will always be money in this 
madhouse.” That was how things were when Au reliano José deserted the feder al troops in 
Nicaragua, signed on as a crewman on a Germa n ship, and appeared in the kitch en of the house, 
sturdy as a horse, as dark and long-haired as an  Indian, and with a secr et determina tion to marry 
Amaranta. 
When Amar anta, saw hi m come in, even though he said nothing she knew immediately why h e 
had come ba ck. At the ta ble they did not dare look each other  in the face. But two  weeks after his  
 76GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
return, in th e presence o f Úrsula, he set his eyes on hers and  said to her, “I always thought a lot  
about you.” Amaranta av oided him. She guarded ag ainst chance meetings. She tried not to become 
separated from Remedios  the Beauty. She was asha med of the b lush that cov ered her cheeks on the 
day her nephew asked her how long she intended wearing the black bandage on her hand, for she 
interpreted it as an allusion to her virginity. Whe n he arrived, she barred the door of her bedroom, 
but she heard his peacef ul snoring in the next room  for so many nights that she forgot about the  
precaution. Early one morning, al most two  months after his return , she h eard him co me into the 
bedroom. Then, instead of fleeing, instead of shouti ng as she had thought she would, she let herself 
be saturated with a soft feeling of  relaxation. She felt him slip i n under the mosquito  netting as he 
had done when he was a child, as he had always  done, and she could not repress her col d sweat and  
the ch attering of her teeth wh en she realized  that h e was  completely naked. “G o awa y,” she 
whispered, suffocating with curiosity. “Go away or  I’ll scream.” But Aureliano José kne w then what 
he had to  do, because h e was no lo nger a child but a barracks animal. Starting with that night the  
dull, inconsequential battles began again and woul d go on unt il dawn. “I’m your aunt,” Amaranta 
murmured, spent. “It’s almost as if I were your mother, not just b ecause of my age but because th e 
only thing I didn’t do for you was nur se you.” Aureliano would escape at da wn and com e back ear ly 
in the morni ng on the n ext day, each time more excited b y the proof tha t she had  not barred th e 
door. He had nit stopped desiring her for a single instant. He found her in the dark bedrooms of  
captured to wns, especial ly in the mo st abject one s, and he wo uld make her materialize in the smell  
of dry blood on the band ages of the wounded, in th e instan taneous terror o f the danger of death, at 
all times and  in all places. He had fled from he r in an attempt to wipe out her memory, not only 
through distance but by means of a muddled fury that  his companions at arms took to be boldness, 
but the more her image wallowed in the dunghill of  the war, the more the war resembled Amaranta.  
That was how he suffered in exile, lo oking fo r a way of killin g her with, his own death, until he 
heard some old man tell the tale of the man who ha d married his aunt, who was also his cousin, and 
whose son ended up being his own grandfather. 
“Can a person marry his own aunt?” he asked, startled. 
“He not only can do tha t, a soldier answered him. “but we’re fighting this war against the priests 
so that a per son can marry his own mother.” 
Two weeks later he des erted. He found Amaran ta more withered than i n his memory, more 
melancholy a nd shy, and now really tu rning the last corner of maturity, but more feverish than ev er 
in the darkness of her bedroom and more challe nging than ever in the aggressiveness of her 
resistance. “You’re a brute,” Amaranta would tell hi m as she was harried by his hounds. “You can’ t 
do that to a poor aunt unless you have a speci al dispensati on from the Pope.” Aureliano, José 
promised to go to Rome, he promised to go across Europe on his knees t o kiss the sa ndals of the  
Pontiff just so that she would lower her drawbridge. 
“It’s not just that,” Amaranta retorted. “Any  children will be born with the tail of a pig.” 
Aureliano José was deaf to all arguments. 
“I don’t care if they’re born as armadillos,” he begged. 
Early one morning, vanquished by the unbearable pa in of repressed virility, he went to Catarino’s. 
He found a woman with  flaccid breasts, affectionate and chea p, who calmed his stomach for some 
time. He tried to apply the treatm ent of disdai n to Amaranta. He would see her on the porch 
working at the sewing machine, which she had lear ned to operate with adm irable skill, and he would 
not even sp eak to her. Amaranta felt freed of a reef, and she herself did not understand why she  
started thinking again at that time ab out Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, why she remembered with  
such nostalgia the afternoons of Chine se checkers, an d why she even desired him as the man in he r 
bedroom. Aureliano, José did not realize how mu ch ground he had lost on, the night he could no 
 77GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
longer bear the farce of indifference and went ba ck to Am aranta’s room. She rejected him with a n 
inflexible and unmistakable determin ation, and she barred the door of her bedroom forever. 
A few months after th e return of Au reliano José an exuberant woman  perfumed with jasmine 
appeared at the house with a boy of five. She stated that h e was the son of Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía and that she had  brought him to Úrsula to be baptized. No one doubted the origins of that 
nameless chi ld: he looked exactly lik e the colonel at  the time he was  taken to see ice for the first 
time. The woman said that he had  been born wi th his eyes open, looking at people with the  
judgment of an adult, and that she was frightened by his way of staring at things without blinking. 
“He’s identical,” Úrsula said. “The only thing mi ssing is for him to m ake chairs rock by simpl y 
looking at them.” They christened him Aureliano and with his mother’s last name, since the law did  
not permit a person to bear his father’s name until he had rec ognized him. General Moncada was  
the godfather. Although Amaranta  insisted that he be  left so that she could take over his upbringing,  
his mother was against it. Úrsula at  that time did not know about the custom of sending virgins to 
the bedroom s of soldiers in the same way that hens are turned loose with  fine roosters, but in th e 
course of that year she found out: nine more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía were brought to 
the house to be baptized. The oldest, a strange da rk boy with green eyes, who was not at all like his  
father’s family, was over  ten years old. They broug ht children o f all ages, all colors, but al l males and  
all with a look of solitude that left no doubt as to the relationship. Only two stood out in the group. 
One, large for his age, made smithereens out of the flowerpots and china b ecause his ha nds seemed  
to have the property of breaking everything they to uched. The other was a blond boy with the same 
light eyes as his mother, whose hair had been left to grow long and curly like that of a woman. He 
entered the house with a great deal of familiarity, as  if he had been raised there, and he went directly 
to a chest in Úrsula’s bedroom and demanded, “I  want the mechanica l ballerina.” Úrsula was  
startled. She opened th e chest, sear ched among th e ancient an d dusty articl es left from the days of  
Melquíades, and wrapped  in a pair of stockings she found the m echanical bal lerina that Pietro Crespi 
had brought to the house once and th at everyone h ad forgotten about. In less than twelve years the y 
baptized with the name Aureliano and the last name of the mother all the sons that the colonel had 
implanted u p and down his theater of war: seven teen. At first Úrsula would fill their pockets with  
money and Amaranta tri ed to have them stay. B ut they finally limited themselves to giving them 
presents and serving as godmothers. “We’ve done our duty by baptizing them,” Úrsula would say,  
jotting down in a ledger the name and  address of the mother a nd the place and date of birth of th e 
child. “Aureliano needs well-kept accounts so that  he can  decide thing s when h e comes back.”  
During lunc h, commenting with G eneral Moncada about that disconcerting proliferation, she 
expressed the desire for Colonel Aureliano Buend ía to come b ack someday and gather a ll of his sons 
together in the house. 
“Don’t worry, dear friend,” General Moncada sa id enigmatically. “He’ll come sooner than you  
suspect.” 
What Gener al Moncada knew and what he did not wish to reveal at lunch was that Colonel 
Aureliano Buendía was already on h is way to h ead up the most prolonged, radical, and bloody  
rebellion of all those he had started up till then. 
The situatio n again beca me as tens e as it had been  during the months that preceded th e first war. 
The cockfights, instituted by the mayor himsel f, were suspended. Captain Aquiles Ricardo, the 
commander of the garrison, took over the exerci se of municipal power. The Liberals looked upon 
him as a provocateur. “Something terrible is go ing to happen,” Úrsula would say to Aureliano José. 
“Don’t go out into th e street after six  o’clock.” Th e entreaties  were usel ess. Aureliano José, just lik e 
Arcadio in other times, had ceased to belong to her.  It was as if his return  home, the possibility of 
existing without concerning himsel f with everyda y neces sities, had a wakened in him th e lewd an d 
lazy leanings of his uncle José Arcadio. His pa ssion for Amaranta had been extinguished without 
 78GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
leaving any scars. He would drift around, playing pool, easing his solitude with occasi onal women,  
sacking the hiding places where Úrsula had forgott en her money. He ended up coming home only to 
change his clothes. “They’re all alike,” Úrsula la mented. “At first they b ehave very well, they’r e 
obedient and  prompt and they don’t seem capabl e of k illing a fly, but as soon as their beards appear  
they go to r uin.” Unlike Arcadio, wh o had never k nown his real origins, he found out that he was 
the son of Pilar Ternera, who had hu ng up a hammock so that he could tak e his siesta i n her house.  
More than mother and son, they were accomplices in  solitude. Pilar Ternera had lost the trail of all 
hope. Her laugh had taken on the tones of an organ, her breasts had succu mbed to the tedium of  
endless caressing, her stomach and her thighs had been the victims of her irrevocable fate as a 
shared wom an, but h er heart grew ol d without bitterness.  Fat, talkative, with the airs of a matron  in 
disgrace, she renounced the sterile illusions of he r cards and found peace and consolati on in other 
people’s loves. In the house where Aureliano José took his siesta, the girls from the nei ghborhood 
would receive their casu al lovers. “Lend me your  room, Pilar,” they woul d simply say when th ey 
were already inside. “Of course,” Pilar would answer. And if anyone was pres ent she woul d explain: 
“I’m happy knowing that people are happy in bed. ” 
She never charged for the service. She never ref used the favor, just as she never refused the 
countless men who sough t her out, even in the twilig ht of her m aturity, without givin g her money or 
love and only occasionally pleasure. Her five daugh ters, who inherited a b urning seed, had been los t 
on the bywa ys of life since adolescen ce. Of the two sons she managed to raise, one died fighting in  
the forces of Colonel A ureliano Buendía and the other was wounded an d captured at the age of 
fourteen wh en he tried to steal a crate of chick ens in a to wn in the s wamp. In a  certain wa y, 
Aureliano José was  the tall, dark man who had  been promised her for half a century by the king of  
hearts, and  like all men sent by the car ds he reache d her heart when h e was already stam ped with  the 
mark of death. She saw it in the cards. 
“Don’t go out tonight,” she told him . “Stay and sleep here because Carmelita Montiel is getting 
tired of asking me to put her in your room.” 
Aureliano José did not ca tch the d eep fee ling of be gging that was in the offer. 
“Tell her to wait for me at midnight” he said. He went to the theater, wher e a Spanish compan y 
was putting on The Dagger of the Fox , which was really Zorzilla’s play with the title changed by order  
of Captain Aquiles Ricardo, because the Liberals  called the Conservatives Goths. Only when he 
handed in hi s ticket at th e door did Aureliano Jo sé realize th at Cap tain Aquiles Ricardo and two 
soldiers armed with rifles were search ing the audience. 
“Be careful, captain,” Au reliano José warned hi m. “The man hasn’t been born yet wh o can lay 
hands on me.” The captain tried to search him forcibly and Aureliano José, who was unarmed, 
began to run. The soldiers disobeyed the order to  shoot. “He’s a Buendía,” one of them explained. 
Blind with rage, the cap tain then snatched awa y the rifle, stepped into the center of th e street, an d 
took aim.” 
“Cowards!” he shouted. “I only wish  it was Colonel Aureliano Buendía.” 
Carmelita M ontiel, a twenty-year-old virgin , had just bathed  in orange-blossom water and was 
strewing ros emary leaves on Pilar Te rnera’s bed wh en the shot rang out. Aureliano José had been 
destined to  find with her the happin ess that Amara nta had  deni ed him, to have seven children, and  
to die in h er arms of old age, but th e bullet tha t entered his b ack and sha ttered his ch est had been  
directed by a wrong interpretation of the cards. Captain Aqu iles Ricardo, who was really the one 
destined to die that night, did indeed die, four hours before Aureliano José. As won as the shot wa s 
heard he was brought down by two s imultaneous bu llets whos e origin was never establi shed and a  
shout of many voices shook the night. 
“Long live the Liberal party! Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendía!” 
 79GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
At twelve o’ clock, when Aureliano, José had bled to death an d Carmelita Montiel found that the 
cards showing her future were blank , more than four hundre d men had f iled past the theater and  
discharged their revolvers into the abandoned bo dy of Captain Aquiles Ricardo. A patrol had to use 
a wheelbarrow to carry th e body, which was heavy with lead an d fell apart like a water-soaked loaf of 
bread. 
Annoyed b y the outrages of the regular army, General José Raquel Moncada used hi s political  
influence, put on his uniform again, a nd assumed th e civil and  military leadership of Ma condo. He 
did not expect, however, that his conciliatory attitu de would be able to prevent the inevitable. The 
news in September was contradictory. While the government announced that it was maintaining 
control thro ughout the country, the Liberals wer e receiving s ecret n ews o f armed uprisings in the 
interior. The regime wou ld not admit a state of wa r until it was proclai med in a d ecree tha t had 
followed a court-martial which had condemned Col onel Aureliano Buendía to death in absentia. The 
first unit that captured hi m was order ed to carry the senten ce out. “This means he’s come back,”  
Úrsula said joyfully to General Moncada. But he himself knew nothing about it. 
Actually, Col onel Aureliano Buendía had been in the country for more than a month.  He was  
preceded by conflicting rumors, sup posed to be in the most distant places at the sa me time, an d 
even General Moncada d id not believ e in his retu rn until it was officially announced that he had  
seized two s tates on the coast. “Congratulations, dear friend,” he told Úrsula, sho wing her th e 
telegram. “You’ll soon have him here.” Úrsula was wo rried then for the first time. “And what will  
you do?” she asked. General Moncada had aske d himself that same question many times. 
“The same as he, my friend,” he answered. “I’ll do  my duty.” 
At dawn on the first of October Col onel Aurelia no Buendía attacked  Macondo with a thousand 
well-armed men and th e garrison received orders to  resist to the end. At noon, while General  
Moncada was lunching with Úrsula, a  rebel canno n shot that echoed in th e whole town blew th e 
front of the municipal treasury to dust. “They’re as well armed as we are,” General Moncada sighed , 
“but besides that they’re fighting  because they want to.” At two o’clock in the afternoon, while the 
earth trembled with the artillery fi re from both sides, he took leave of Úrsula with the certainty that 
he was fighting a losing battle. 
“I pray to God that you won’t have Aureliano in the house tonight,” he said. “If it does happen 
that wa y, give him an em brace for me, because I d on’t expect ever to see him again.” 
That night he was captur ed when he tried to escap e from Macondo, after writing a long letter to  
Colonel Aureliano Buendía in which he reminded him of their common aim to huma nize the war 
and he wished him a final victory over the corrupt ion of the militarists and the ambitions of the 
politicians in both parties . On the following day Colonel Aureliano Buendía had lunch with him in 
Úrsula’s house, where he was being held until a rev olutionary court-martial decided his f ate. It was a  
friendly gath ering. But w hile the adversaries forgo t the war to remember th ings of the past, Úrsula 
had the gloo my feeling that her son was an intru der. She had  felt it ever s ince she sa w him come i n 
protected  by a noisy military reti nue, which tu rned the bedrooms inside out u ntil they were  
convinced th ere was no danger. Colonel Aureliano Buend ía not only accepted it but he gave strict 
orders that no one shou ld come clos er than  ten feet, not even Úrsula, wh ile the members of his  
escort finished placing guards about the house. He was wearin g an ordinary denim uniform with no  
insignia of any kind and high boots with spurs that were cak ed with mud  and dried bl ood. On his 
waist he wor e a holster with the flap o pen and  his hand, which was always on the butt of the pistol,  
revealed the same wa tchful and resolute tension a s his look. His head, with deep recessions in the 
hairline now, seemed to  have been baked in a sl ow oven. His face, tanned by the salt of the 
Caribbean, had acquired a metallic hardness. He w as preserved against imminent  old age by a vitality 
that h ad som ething to do with the cold ness of his in sides. He was taller th an when h e had left, paler  
and bonier, and he showed the first symptoms of resistance to nostalgia. “Good Lord,” Úrsula sai d 
 80GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
to herself. “Now he look s like a man  capable of anything.” He was. The Aztec sha wl that he brough t 
Amaranta, the remembr ances he spo ke of at lunch,  the funny stories her told were sim ple leftovers 
from his humor of a different time. As soon as the order to bury the dead in a common grave was 
carried out, he assigned Colonel Roque Carnicero the minion of setting up courts-martial and he 
went ahead with the exh austing task of imposing ra dical reforms which would not leave a stone of  
the reestabli shed Conservative regim e in place. “W e have to get ahead of the politicians in the 
party,” he said to his aides. “When they open thei r eyes to real ity they’ll find accomplis hed facts.” It 
was then  that he d ecided to review the titles  to land that went ba ck a hundred years and he 
discovered the legalized outrages of his brother, José Arcadio . He annulled the registrations with a  
stroke of the pen. As a la st gesture of courtesy, he  left his affairs for an ho ur and visited Rebeca to 
bring her up to date on what he was d etermined to do. 
In the shado ws of her ho use, the solitary widow w ho at on e time had b een the co nfidante of his  
repressed loves and whose persistence had saved hi s life was a specter out of the past. Encased in 
black down to her knuckles, with her heart turned to ash, she scarcely knew anything about the war.  
Colonel Aur eliano Buend ía had the impression that the phosphorescence of her bones  was showing 
through her skin and that she moved in an atmosphe re of Saint Elmo’s fire, in a stagnant air where 
one could still note a hidden smell of gunpowder. He be gan by advising her to moderate the rigor o f 
her mourning, to ventilate the house, to forgive the world for t he death of José Arcadio. But Rebeca 
was already beyond an y vanity. After  searching for it  uselessly in the taste o f earth, in, th e perfumed 
letters from Pietro Crespi, in the tem pestuous bed of her husband, she had found peace in tha t 
house where memories materialized through the stre ngth of implacable evocation and  walked like 
human bein gs through the cloistered  rooms, Leanin g back in her wicker rocking chair, looking at  
Colonel Aureliano Buendía as if he were the one w ho looked like a ghost out of the past, Rebeca 
was not even upset b y the news  that the lands  usurped by Jos é Arcadio would be retu rned to th eir 
rightful own ers. 
“Whatever you decide will be done, Aureliano,” sh e sighed. “I always thought and now I have the 
proof that you’re a renegade.” 
The revision of the deed s took place at the same time as th e summary courts-martial presided 
over by Col onel Gerinel do Márquez, which end ed with th e execution of all officers of the regular 
army who had been taken prisoner by the revolutiona ries. The last court-martial was that of Jos é 
Raquel Moncada. Úrsula intervened. ‘”His govern ment was th e best we’ve ever had in  Macon do,” 
she told Colonel Aureliano Buendía. “I don’t have to  tell you anything about his good heart, abou t 
his affection for us, because you kno w better th an anyone.” Colonel Aureliano Buen día gave her a 
disapproving look. 
“I can’t take over the job of admi nistering justice,” he replied. “If you have something to say, tell  
it to the cour t-martial.” 
Úrsula not only did that she also brought all of  the mothers of the revolutionary officers who 
lived in Macondo to testi fy. One by o ne the old women who h ad been foun ders of the town, several 
of whom had taken part in the daring crossing of the mountains, praised the virtues of General  
Moncada. Úrsula was th e last in  line. Her gloomy dignity, the weight of her name, th e convincing  
vehemence of her declar ation mad e the scale of j ustice hesitate for a moment. “You have taken this  
horrible game very seriously and you have done well because you are doing your duty,” she told the 
members of the court. “But don’t forget that as long as God gives us life we will still be mothers and 
no matter h ow revolutionary you may be, we have the right to pull down your pants and give you a 
whipping at the first sign of disrespect.” The cour t retired to d eliberate as  those words sti ll echoed i n 
the school that had been turned into a barracks.  At midnight General José Raquel Moncada was 
sentenced to death. Colonel Aureliano Buendía, in sp ite of the violent recrimination s of Úrsula, 
 81GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
refused to commute the sentence. A short while befo re dawn  he visited th e condemn ed man in th e 
room used as a cell. 
“Remember, old friend,” he told him. “I’m not shooting you. It’s the revolution that’s shooting 
you.” 
General Moncada did no t even get up  from the cot when he s aw him come in. 
“Go to hell, friend,” he a nswered. 
Until that m oment, ever since his return. Col onel Aureliano B uendía had not given himself the 
opportunity to see him with his hear t. He was startled to see how much he had aged, how his hands  
shook, and the rather punctilious conformity with whic h he awaited death, and then he felt a great 
disgust with himself, which he mi ngled with the beginnings of pity. 
“You know better than I, ” he said, “that all courts-m artial are farces and  that you’re reall y paying  
for the crim es of other p eople, because this tim e we’re going to win th e war at an y price. Wouldn’t 
you have do ne the sam e in my place?”  
General Moncada, got up to clean his thick hor n-rimmed glasses on his shirttail. “Probably,” he 
said. “But what worries me is not your shooting me, because after all, for people like u s it’s a natural  
death.” He laid his glasses on the bed  and took off his watch  and chain. “W hat worries me,” he wen t 
on, “is that out of so much hatred for the military,  out of fighting them so  much and thinking about 
them so  much, you’ve ended up as bad as they are. And no ideal in li fe is worth that much  
baseness.” He took off his wedding ring and the medal of  the Virgin of Help and put them 
alongside his glasses and watch. 
“At this rate,” he concluded, “you’ll not only be the most despotic and bloody dictator in our 
history, but you’ll shoot my dear friend Úrsul a in an attempt to pacify your conscience. ” 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía stood there impassively. General Moncada then gave him the glasses, 
medal, watch, and ring an d he changed his tone. 
“But I didn’t send for you to scold yo u,” he said. “I wanted to ask you the f avor of sending these 
things to my wife.” 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía put them i n his pockets . 
“Is she still in Manaure?” 
“She’s still in Manaure,” General M oncada confir med, “in the same house  behind the church 
where you sent the letter.” 
“I’ll be glad to, José Raquel, ” Colonel Aureliano Buendía said. 
When he went out into the blue air of the mist his face grew damp as on some other dawn in the 
past and onl y then  did he realize th at -he had order ed the s entence to  be carried out in th e courtyar d 
and not at the cemetery wall. The firing squad, drawn up opposite the door, paid him the honors of  
a head of state. 
“They can bring him out now,” he ordered.

Chapter 9 
COLONE L GERINELDO MÁRQUE Z was the first to perceive th e emptiness of the war. In his position  
as civil and military leader of Macondo he would have telegra phic conversations twi ce a week with 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía. At first those excha nges would determine th e course of a flesh-and-
blood war, the perfectly defined outlines of which told them at any momen t the exact s pot -where it 
was and the prediction of its future  direction. Alth ough he nev er let himsel f be pulled into the area  
of confidences, not even by his closest friends, Colonel Aureliano Buendía still had at that time th e 
familiar tone that made it possible to identify him at the other end of the wi re. Many times he would 
prolong the talk beyond the expected  limit and let them drift i nto comm ents of a domestic nature.  
Little by little, however, and as the war became m ore intense a nd widespread, his image was fading 
away into a universe of unreality. The characteri stics of his speech were m ore and more uncertain,  
and they ca m together and combined to form word s that were gradually losing all meaning. Colone l 
Gerineldo Márquez limited himself then to just liste ning, burdened by the impression that he was i n 
telegraphic contact with a  stranger from another world. 
“I understand, Aureliano,” he would conclude on the key. “Long live the Liberal party!” 
He finally lost all contact with the wa r. What in ot her times ha d been a real  activity, an i rresistible 
passion of his youth, became a remote point of refe rence for him: an emptiness. His only refuge was 
Amaranta’s s ewing room. He would visit her ever y afternoon. He liked to watch her hands as she 
curled frothy petticoa t cloth in the ma chine that was kept in motion by Remedios the Beauty. They 
spent man y hours without speaking, content with  their recipro cal compa ny, but while Amaranta was  
inwardly pleased in keep ing the fire of his devoti on alive, he was unaware of the secret designs of 
that indecipherable heart. When th e news of his return reach ed her, Amaranta had been smothered  
by anxiety. But when she saw him enter the house in the middle of Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s 
noisy escort and she saw how he had  been mistreated  by the r igors of exile, made old by age an d 
oblivion, dirty with sweat and dust, smelling like a he rd, ugly, with his left arm in a sling, she felt 
faint with disillusionment. “My God,” she thought. “This wasn’t the person I was waiting for.” On 
the following day, however, he came back to the house shaved and clean, with his mustache 
perfumed wi th lavender water an d without the bl oody sling. He br ought her a prayer book bound in 
mother-of-pearl. 
“How strange men are,” she said, because she could not think of anything else to say. “They 
spend their lives fighting against priest s and then give prayerbooks as gifts.” 
From that time on, even during the most critical  days of the war, he visited her every afternoon. 
Many times,  when Rem edios the Bea uty was no t present, it was he who turned the wheel on the 
sewing machine. Amara nta felt upset by the p erseverance, the loyalty,  the submis siveness of tha t 
man who was invested with so much authority an d who nevertheless took off his sidearm in the 
living room so that he could go into the sewing  room without weapons, But for four years he kept 
repeating his love and sh e would always find a way to reject him without hurting him, for even  
though she had not succeeded in  loving him she could no l onger live without him. Remedios th e 
Beauty, who seemed indifferent to everything and w ho was tho ught to be mentally retard ed, was not 
insensitive to so much devotion and she inter vened in Colonel Gerineldo Márquez’s favor. 
Amaranta  suddenly disco vered that th e girl she had raised, wh o was just entering adolescence, was 
already the most beautiful creature that had even  been seen in Macondo. She felt reborn in her heart 
the rancor that she had felt in other days for Rebeca, and beg ging God not to impel her into the 
extreme sta te of wishing her dead, sh e banished h er from the sewing room. It was arou nd that time 
that Colonel  Gerineldo Márquez began to feel the boredom of the war. He summoned  his reserves 
 83GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
of persuasion, his broad and repressed tenderness , ready to give up for Amaranta a gl ory that had  
cost him the sacrifice of his best years. But he could not succeed in conv incing her. One Au gust 
afternoon, overcome by the unbearabl e weight of he r own obs tinacy, Amaranta locked  herself in her 
bedroom to weep over h er solitude unto death after giving her final answer to her tena cious suitor: 
“Let’s forget about each other forever,” she told hi m. “We’re too old for this sort of thing now.” 
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had a telegraphic call from Colonel Aureliano Buendía that 
afternoon. It was a routine conversation which wa s not going to bring about any break in the 
stagnant war. At the end, Colonel Geri neldo Márquez looked  at the desola te streets, th e crystal wa ter 
on the almo nd trees, and  he found himself lost in solitude. 
“Aureliano,” he said sadly on the key, “it’s raining in Macondo.” 
There was a long silence on the line. Suddenly the apparatus jumped with the pitiless letters from 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía. 
“Don’t be a jackass, Gerineldo,” the signals said. “It’s natural for it to be raining in Augu st.” 
They had  not seen  each other for such  a long tim e that Colonel Gerineld o Márquez was upset by 
the aggressiveness of the reaction. Two months  later, however, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía 
returned to Macondo, his upset was changed to stupefaction.  Even Úrsula was surprised at how 
much he had changed. He came with no noise, no escort, wrapped in a cloak in spite of the heat, 
and with three mistresses , whom he installed in the same hou se, where he spent most of his time 
lying in a hammock. He scarcely read  the telegraphic dispatches that repo rted routine operations. 
On one occasion Colonel Gerineldo Márquez as ked him for instructions for the eva cuation of a  
spot on the border where there was a danger that the conflict would become an intern ational affair. 
“Don’t bother me with tr ifles,” he ordered him. “Consult Divine Providence.” 
It was perhaps the most critical moment of th e war. The Liberal landowner s, who had s upported  
the revolution in the begi nning, had made secret allia nces with the Conser vative landowners in order 
to stop the revision of property titles. The politicia ns who supplied funds for the war from exile had 
Publicly repudiated the drastic aims of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, but even that withdrawal of 
authorization did not seem to bother him. He h ad not returned to reading his poetry, which fille d 
more than fi ve volumes and lay forgotten at th e bottom of hi s trunk. At night or at si esta tim e he 
would call one of his women to his hammock and  obtain a rudimentary satisfaction from her, and 
then he woul d sleep like a stone tha t was not concerned by the s lightest indication of worry. Only he 
knew at th at time tha t his confused heart was cond emned to un certainty for ever. At first, intoxicated  
by the glory of his return, by his remar kable victori es, he had peeped into th e abyss of greatness. H e 
took pleasure in keeping by his right hand the Du ke of Marlborough, his great teach er in the art of  
war, whose attire of skins and tiger claws aroused  the resp ect of adults an d the awe of children. It 
was then that he decided that no hu man being, not even Úrsula, could com e closer to hi m than ten  
feet. In the center of the chalk circle that his aides would draw wherever he stopped, and  which onl y 
he could enter, he would decide with brief orders that had no appeal the fa te of the wor ld. The first 
time that he was in Manaure after the shooting  of General  Moncada, he hastened to fulfill his 
victim’s last wish and the widow took the glasses,  the medal, the watch, an d the ring, but she would 
not let him i n the door. 
“You can’t come in, colonel,” she told him. “You  may be in command of your war, but I’m in 
command of  my house.” 
Colonel Aureliano Buend ía did not show any sign of anger, but his spirit only calmed  down when  
his bodyguard had sacked the widow’s house and  reduced it to ashes. “Watch out for  your heart,  
Aureliano,” Colonel Ger ineldo Márquez would  say to him th en. “You’re rotting alive.” About that 
time he called together a  second  assembly of the principal rebe l comma nders. He found all typ es: 
idealists, ambitious people, adventurers, those wi th social resentments, even common criminals. 
There was even a former Conservative functionary w ho had  taken refuge in th e revolt to escape a 
 84GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
judgment for misappropriation of funds. Many of them did n ot even kno w why they were fighting 
in the mids t of that motley crowd, whose differen ces of val ues were on  the verge o f causing an  
internal explosion, one gloomy authority stood  out: General Te6filo Vargas. He was a full-blooded  
Indian, untamed, illiterate, and endowed with qui et wiles and a messianic vocation that aroused a 
demented fa naticism in his men. Colonel Aureliano Buendía called the m eeting with the aim o f 
unifying the rebel comma nd against the maneuvers  of the politicians. Gener al Teófilo Vargas came 
forward with his intentions: in a few hours he sha ttered the coal ition of better-qualified commanders  
and took ch arge of the main comm and. “He’s a wild beast worth watching,” Colone l Aureliano 
Buendía told his officers. “That man is more dang erous to us than the Mi nister of War.” Then a 
very young captain who h ad always been outstandin g for his timidity raised a cautious in dex finger. 
“It’s quite simple, colonel,” he propos ed. “He has to be killed.” 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not alarmed by the coldness of the proposition but by the way in 
which, by a fraction of a second, it had  anticipated his own thou ghts. 
“Don’t expect me to give an order like that,” he sai d. 
He did not give it, as a m atter of fact. But two  weeks later Gen eral Teófilo Vargas was  cut to  bits 
by mach etes in an a mbush and Colo nel Aurelian o Buendía as sumed the main comm and. The sam e 
night that his authority was recognized by all the rebel commands, he woke up in a frigh t, calling fo r 
a blanket. An inner coldness which s hattered his bone s and to rtured him even in the heat of the sun  
would not let him sleep f or several months, until i t became a habit. The intoxication of power began 
to break apart under wav es of discomfort. Searching for a cure against the chill, he had the young  
officer who had proposed the murder of General Te ófilo Vargas shot. His orders were being carried 
out even  before they were given, even before he thought of them, an d they alwa ys went much 
beyond wh at he would h ave dared h ave them  do. Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he 
began to lose direction. He wa s bothered by the people who cheered  him in neighboring villa ges, 
and he ima gined that they were th e same cheers they gave the enemy. Everywhere he met 
adolescents who looked at him with his own e yes, who spoke to him with his own voice, who 
greeted him with the sa me mistrust wi th which he greeted them, and who said they were his sons. 
He felt scattered about, multiplied, and more so litary than ever. He was convinced that his own 
officers were lying to him. He fought with the Du ke of Ma rlborough. “The best friend a person 
has,” he would say at that time, “is one who has j ust died.” He was weary of  the uncertainty, of the 
vicious circle of that eter nal war tha t always found  him in the s ame place, b ut always  older, wearier, 
even more i n the posi tion of not kno wing why, o r how, or ev en when. Th ere was alwa ys someon e 
outside of the chalk circl e. Someone who need ed money, someone who had a son wi th whooping 
cough, or someone who wanted to go  off and sleep forever because he cou ld not stand the shit taste 
of the war in his mouth and who, nevertheless, stood at attention to inform him: “Everything 
normal, colonel.” And normality was precisely the most fearful part of that infinite war: nothing ever 
happened. Alone, abandoned by his premonitions, fleeing the c hill that was to accompany him until 
death, he sought a last re fuge in Macondo in th e warmth of his oldest memories. His indolence wa s 
so serious that when they announced the arrival of a commission from his party that was  authorized  
to discuss th e stalemate o f the war, he rolled ov er in his hammo ck without completely waking up. 
“Take them to the whores,” he said. 
They were six lawyers in frock coats a nd top hats  who endured the violent November sun with 
stiff stoicism. Úrsula put them up in her house. They spent the greater part of the day closeted in the 
bedroom in hermetic co nferences an d at dusk they asked for an escort an d some acco rdion players 
and took over Catarino’s store. “Leave them alone ,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía ordered. “After all, 
I know wha t they wan t.” At th e beginning of Dece mber the lon g-awaited interview, which many had 
foreseen as a n interminab le argument, was resolved in less than an hour. 
 85GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
In the hot p arlor, beside the specter o f the pia nola shrouded in a white sheet, Colonel Aureliano  
Buendía did not sit down  that time in side the ch alk circle that his aides had  drawn. He s at in a chai r 
between his political advisers and, wrapped in his woolen blanket, he listened in silence to the brief 
proposals of the emissaries. They asked first that he  renounce the revision of property titles in order  
to get back the support of the Liberal landowners. They asked, secondly, that he renounce the fight 
against clerical influence in order to obtain the support of the Catholic masses. They as ked, finally, 
that he renounce the aim of equal rights for natura l and illegitimate children in order to preserve the 
integrity of the home. 
“That means,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía said, sm iling wh en the reading was over, “that all 
we’re fightin g for is powe r.” 
“They’re tactical changes, ” one of the delegates re plied. “Right now the mai n thing is to broaden 
the popular base of the war. Then we’ll have another look.” 
One of Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s political advisers hastened to intervene. 
“It’s a contradiction” he said. “If these changes are good, it m eans that the Conservative regime 
is good. If we succeed in broadening the popular ba se of the war with them, as you people say, it 
means that the regime his a broad popular base. It means, in short, that for almost twenty years 
we’ve been fighting against the sen timents of the na tion.” 
He was going to go on, but Colonel Aureliano Bue ndía stopped him with a signal. “D on’t was te 
your time, doctor.” he said. “The important thin g is that from now on we’ll be fighting only for 
power.” Still smiling, he took the documents the de legates gave him and made ready to sign them. 
“Since that’s the way i t is,” he concluded, “we have no objectio n to acceptin g.” 
His men looked at one another in consterna tion. “Excuse me, colonel,” Colonel Gerineldo 
Márquez said softly, “but this is a betrayal.” 
Colonel Aur eliano Buendía held the inked pen in th e air and  discharged the whole weight of his 
authority on him. 
“Surrender y our weapons ,” he ordered. 
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez stood up and put his sidearms on the table. 
“Report to the barracks,” Colone l Aureliano Buendía ordered him. “Put yourself at the 
disposition of the revolutionary court.” 
Then he signed the declaration and ga ve the shee ts of paper to the emissaries , saying to them: 
“Here an yo ur papers, gentlemen. I h ope you can get some adv antage out of  them.” 
Two days later, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, accu sed of high treason, was  condemned  to death. 
Lying in his hammock, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was insensible to the pleas for clemency. On the 
eve of the execution, disobeying the order not to  bother him, Úrsula visited him in his bedroom. 
Encased in black, invested with a rare solemnity, she stood during the three minutes of the 
interview. “I know that you’re going to shoot Ge rineldo,” she said calmly, “and that I can’t do 
anything to stop it. But I give you one warning: as soon as I see his bod y I swear to you by the 
bones of my father and mother, by the memory of José Arcadio Buendía, I swear to you before God  
that I will drag you out from wherever you’re hi ding and kill y ou with my own two hands.” Before  
leaving the room, without waiting for any reply, she concluded:  
“It’s the same as if you’d been born wi th the tail of a pig.” 
During that interminable night while Colonel Gerineldo Márquez thought about his dead 
afternoons in Amaranta’ s sewing room, Colonel Aureliano Buendía scratched for many hours trying 
to break the hard shell of his solitude. His onl y happy moments, since that remote afternoon when 
his father had taken him to see ice, had taken plac e in his silve r workshop where he pas sed the time 
putting little gold fishes together . He had had to s tart thirty-two wa rs and had had to v iolate all of  
his pacts with dea th an d wallow lik e a hog in the dungheap of glory in order to discover the  
privileges of simplicity almost forty years late. 
 86GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
At dawn, wo rn out by the tormented vigil, he a ppeared in the cell an hour before the execution. 
“The farce is over, old friend,” he said to Colone l Gerineldo Márquez. “Let’s get out of here before 
the mosquitoes in here execute you.”  Colonel Gerine ldo Márquez could not repress the disdain that 
was inspired in him by th at attitud e. 
“No, Aureliano,” he replied. “I’d rather be dead tha n see you ch anged into a bloody tyran t.” 
“You won’t see me,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía said . “Put o n your shoes and help me get this 
shitty war ov er with.” 
When he said it he did not know that it was easi er to start a war than to end one. It took him  
almost a yea r of fierce and bloody ef fort to force the government to propose conditi ons of peace  
favorable to the rebels and another  year to convince his own partisans of the convenience of 
accepting them. He went to inconceivable extremes of cruelty t o put down the rebellion of his own 
officers, who resisted an d called for victory, and he finally relied on enem y forces to make the m 
submit. 
He was n ever a greater s oldier than a t that time. The certain ty that he wa s finally fighting for his 
own liberati on and not for abstract ideals, for slog ans that politicians could twist left and right 
according to the circumstances, filled him with an  ardent enthusiasm. Colonel Gerineldo Márquez,  
who fought for defeat with as much conviction an d loyalty as he had previously fought for victory,  
reproached him for h is useless temerity. “Don’t wo rry,” he would say, smilin g. “Dying is  much more 
difficult than one imagines.” In his case it was tr ue. The certainty that his da y was assign ed gave him 
a mysterious immunity, an immortality or a fixed peri od that made him invulnerable to the risks of  
war and in  the end perm itted him  to win a defeat that was mu ch more difficult, much more bloody  
and costly th an victory. 
In almost twenty years of war, Colonel Aureliano Bue ndía had  been at his house many times, but 
the sta te of  urgency wi th which h e always arri ved, the mil itary retinue that acco mpanied him 
everywhere, the aura of legend that glowed abou t his presence and of whic h even Úrsula was aware,  
changed him  into a  stran ger in the en d. The last time tha t he was in Maco ndo and too k a house fo r 
his three con cubines, he was seen in his own hou se only on two or three o ccasions when he had th e 
time to accept an invitation to dine. Remedios the Beauty and  the twins, born during the middle of  
the war, scarcely knew hi m. Amaranta  could not r econcile her image of the brother who had spent 
his adolescence making l ittle gold fi shes with that of the m ythical warrior who had placed a distance 
of ten feet between himself and the rest of huma nity. But when th e approach of the armisti ce 
became kno wn and  they thought tha t he would r eturn changed back into  a human  being, delivered 
at last for t he hearts of his own pe ople, the fa mily feelings , dormant fo r such a long time, were 
reborn stronger than ever. 
“We’ll finally have a man in the house again,” Úrsula said. 
Amaranta was the first to suspect th at they had  lost him forever. One week before th e armistice,  
when he entered the hou se without a n escort, pre ceded by two barefoot orderlies who deposited on 
the porch  the sad dle from the mule and the trun k of poetry, all that was l eft of his former imperial 
baggage, she saw him pass by the sewing room an d she called to him. Colonel Aurel iano Buendía 
had trouble recognizing her. 
“It’s Amaranta,” she said good-humoredly, happy at his retu rn, and she showed him  the hand  
with the black bandage. “Look.” 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía smiled at her the same way as wh en he had first seen her with the 
bandage on that remote morning when he had co me back to Macondo condemned to death. 
“How awful,” he said, “the way time passes!” 
The regular army had to protect the h ouse. He arrive d amid ins ults, spat up on, accused of having 
accel erated the war in order to sell it for a better pr ice. He was trembling with fever and cold and his  
armpits were studded with sores again. Six mont hs before, when she had heard talk about the 
 87GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
armistice, Úrsula had opened up and swept out th e bridal cha mber and ha d burned myrrh in the 
corners, thinking that he would come back read y to grow old slowly among Remedios’ musty dolls. 
But actu ally, during the la st two  years he had paid his final dues to life, inclu ding growing old. When 
he passed by the silver shop, which Úrsula had pr epared wi th special di ligence, he d id not even 
notice tha t the keys were in the lock. He did not notice the mi nute, tearing destruction that time had  
wreaked on the house and that, after such a prolonged absence, would have looked like a disaster to  
any man wh o had kept h is memories alive. He wa s not pained  by the p eeling of the whitewash o n 
the walls or the dirty, cottony cob webs in the corn ers or the du st on the b egonias or the veins left 
on the beam s by the ter mites or the moss on the hinges  or any of the insidious traps that nostalgi a 
offered him. He sat down on the porch, wrapped in his blanket and with his boots still on, as if only 
waiting for it to clear, and he spent the whole afternoon watching it rain on the begonias. Úrsula 
understood then that they would not have him home for long. “If it’s not the war,” she thought, “it 
can only be death.” It was a supposition that was  so neat, so convincing that she identified it as a 
premonition. 
That night, at dinner, the supposed Aureliano Se gundo broke his bread with his right hand and 
drank his soup with his left. His twin brother, th e supposed José Arcadio Segundo, broke his brea d 
with his left hand and  drank his soup with his  right. So precis e was their c oordination that they did 
not look like two  brother s sitting opp osite ea ch other but like a  trick with  mirrors. The spectacl e that 
the twins had invented when they became aware that they were equal was repeated in honor of the 
new arrival. But Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not not ice it. He seem ed so alien to ev erything that  
he did not even notice R emedios the Beauty as she passed by naked on her way to her  bedroom. 
Úrsula was the only one who dared disturb his, abstraction. 
“If you have to go away again,” she said halfwa y through dinner, “at least try to rem ember how 
we were tonight.” 
Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía realized, witho ut surprise, that Úrsula was the onl y human  
being who had succeeded in penetrating his misery, and for the first time in many year s he looked  
her in the face. Her skin was leathery,  her teeth de cayed, her h air faded and colorless, and her look 
frightened. He compared her with the oldest memory  that he had of her, the afternoon when he had  
the premonition that a pot of boilin g soup was going to fall off the table, and he found her broken 
to pieces. In an instant he discovered the scratches,  the welts, th e sores, the ulcers, and the scan tha t 
had been left on her by more than half a century of daily life, and he saw that those damages did not 
even arouse a feeling of pity in him. Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place 
where his affection had r otted a way and he could not fi nd it. On another occasi on, he felt at least a  
confused sense of sham e when  he found the sm ell of Úrsula  on his own skin, and more than once  
he felt her  thoughts interfering with his. But al l of that had  been  wiped  out by th e war. Even  
Remedios, his wife, at th at momen t was a hazy image of someone who might have been his daugh-
ter. The cou ntless wom en he had  known on the d esert of love and who had  spread his seed all along 
the co ast had left no trace in his feeli ngs. Most of them  had come into  his room in th e dark and h ad 
left before dawn, and on  the following day they were nothing but a tou ch of fatigue in his bodily 
memory. Th e only affection that pr evailed against time and the war was that which  he had felt for 
his brother José Arcadio when they both were ch ildren, a nd it was not based on love but on 
complicity. 
“I’m sorry,” he excused himself from Úrsula’s reques t. “It’s just that the wa r has done a way with  
everything.” 
During the following days he busied himself destro ying all trace of his passage through the world. 
He stripped the silver shop until all that were left  were impersonal objects, he gave his clothes away 
to the orderlies, and he buried his weapons in th e courtyard with the s ame feeling of penance with 
which his father had buried the spear that had kille d Prudencio Aguilar. He kept only one pistol with 
 88GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
one bullet in  it. Úrsula did not intervene. The only time sh e dissuaded him was when he was ab out 
to destroy the daguerreotype of Remedios that wa s kept in the parlor lighted by an eternal lamp.  
“That pictur e stopped  belonging to you a long ti me ago,” she told him. “I t’s a family r elic.” On the 
eve of the ar mistice, when no single object tha t would let him be remembered was left in the house,  
he took the trunk of poetry to  the ba kery when  Santa Sofía d e la Piedad wa s making ready to  light 
the oven. 
“Light it with this,” he told her, handing her the first roll of yellowish papers. “It will, burn better  
because th ey’re very old things.” 
Santa Sofía de la Piedad,  the silen t one, the cond escending o ne, the one who never contradicted  
anyone, not even her own children, had the impression that it was a forbidden act. 
“They’re important papers,” she said. 
“Nothing of the sort,” the colonel said. “They’ re things that a person writes to himself.” 
“In that case,” she said, “you burn them, colonel.” 
He not only did that, but he broke up the trunk wi th a hatchet a nd threw the pieces into the fire. 
Hours before, Pilar Ternera had come to visit hi m. After so many years of  not seeing her, Colonel 
Aureliano Buendía was startled at how old and fa t she had become and how much she had lost of 
the splendor  of her laugh, but he was also startled  at the d epths she had  reached  in her reading of  
the cards. “Watch ou t for your mou th,” she told  him, and h e wondered whether th e other time sh e 
had told him  that during the height of his glory it had not been a surprisingly anticipated vision of  
his fate. A s hort time later, when his personal physi cian finished removing his sores, he asked him, 
without showing any particular interest, where the exact location of his heart was. The doctor 
listened with  his stethos cope and then painted a ci rcle on his cheat wi th a p iece of cotto n dipped in  
iodine. 
The Tuesday of the armistice dawned  warm an d rainy. Colonel Aureliano Buendía appeared in 
the kitchen before five o’clock and had his usual black coffe e without sugar. “You ca me into the 
world on a day like this,” Úrsula told him. “Every body was a mazed a t your open eyes.” He did not 
pay any attention becaus e he was listening to th e forming of the troops, the sound of the comets,  
and the voices of comma nd that were shattering th e dawn. Ev en though after so many years of war 
they should have sounded familiar to him this time  he felt the same weakness in his knees and th e 
same tingling in his  skin that he had felt in his youth in the presence of a naked woman. He thought 
confusedly, finally captive in a trap of nostalgia, that perhaps if he had ma rried her he would have 
been a man without war and withou t glory, a nameless artisan, a happy ani mal. That tar dy shudder 
which had n ot figured in his forethought made his  breakfast bitter. At s even in the mor ning, when  
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez cam e to fetch him, in the comp any of a group of rebel officers, he 
found him more taciturn than ever, more pensiv e and solitary. Úrsula tried to throw a new wrap 
over his sho ulders. “Wh at will the government think,” she t old him. “T hey’ll figu re that you’ve 
surrendered because you didn’t have anything left to buy a cloak with.” But he would not accept it. 
When he was at the door,  he let her put an old felt hat of José Arcadio Buendía’s on his head. 
“Aureliano,” Úrsula said to him then,  “Promise me that if you  find that it’s a bad  hour for you  
there tha t you’ll think of your mother.” 
He gave her  a distant s mile, raising his hand with all his fingers extended , and withou t saying a 
word he left the house an d faced the s houts, insul ts, and blasph emies th at would follow him until he 
left the town . Úrsula put the bar on the door, having decided not to take it down for the rest of her  
life. “We’ll rot in here,” she thought. “We’ll turn to ashes in this house without men, but we won’ t 
give this miserable town the pleasure of seeing us weep.” She spent the wh ole morning looking for a 
memory of her son in the most hidden corners, but she could find none. 
The ceremo ny took place fifteen miles from Macondo in the sh ade of a gigantic ceiba tree around 
which th e town of Neerlandia would be founded later. The d elegates from the governm ent and  the 
 89GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
party and th e com mission of the rebels who were laying down their arms were served by a nois y 
group of novices in white habits who looked like a flock of doves that ha d been frightened b y the 
rain. Colonel Aureliano B uendía arrived on a mudd y mule. He had not shav ed, more tor mented by 
the pain of t he sores than by the grea t failure of  his dreams, for he had reac hed the end of all hope,  
beyond  glory and the nostalgia of glory. In a ccord ance wi th his arrangements there wa s no music,  
no fireworks, no pealing bells, no shouts of victory, or any oth er manifestation that might alter th e 
mournful character of the armistice. An itiner ant photographer who took the only picture of him  
that could ha ve been pres erved was forced to smas h his plates without developing them. 
The ceremo ny lasted on ly the time necessary to  sign the documents. Ar ound the rustic tab le 
placed in th e center of a  patched circus tent wher e the d elegates sat were the last officers who were 
faithful to Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Before ta king the signatures, the personal delegate of the 
president of the republic tried to read the act of surrender aloud, but Colonel Aureliano Buendía was 
against it. “Let’s not waste time on formalities,” he  said and prepared to sign the papers without 
reading them. One of his officers then broke the soporific silenc e of the tent.  
“Colonel,” he said, “please do us the favor of not being the first to sign.” 
Colonel Aureliano Buend ía acced ed. When the do cuments went all around the table, in the mids t 
of a silence that was so pure that one could have  deciphered the signatures from the scratching of 
the pen on the paper, the first line was still blank.  Colonel Aureliano Buendía prepared to fill it. 
“Colonel,” a nother of his officers said, “there’s still time for everything to come out right.” 
Without changing his expression, Colonel Aurelia no Buendía signed the first copy. He had not 
finished signing the last one when  a rebel colonel  appeared in  the doorwa y leading a mule carrying 
two chests. In spite of his entire youth he had a dry look and a patient expression. He was the 
treasurer of the revolution in the Macondo region . He had made a difficult journey of six days, 
pulling along the mule, who was dying of hunger, in or der to arrive at the ar mistice on time. With an 
exasperating parsimony he took down  the ches ts, opened them, and placed o n the table, o ne by on e, 
seventy-two gold bricks, Everyone ha d forgotten abou t the existence of that fortune. In the disorder 
of the past year, when th e central co mmand fell apart and th e revolution degenerated into a blood y 
rivalry of leaders, it was  impossible to determin e any respon sibility. The gold of the revolution, 
melted into  blocks that were th en covered wi th baked clay, was beyond all control. Colonel  
Aureliano Buendía had the seventy- two gold bricks included in the inventory of surrender and 
closed the ceremony without allowing any speeche s. The filthy adolescent stood opposite him,  
looking into his eyes with  his own cal m, syrup-colored eyes. 
“Something else?” Colonel Aureliano Buendía asked him. 
The young colonel tightened his mouth. 
“The receipt,” he said. 
Colonel Aureliano Buend ía wrote it out in his own hand. Then he had a gl ass of lemonade and a 
piece of biscuit that the novices wer e passing arou nd and retired to a field tent which had been  
prepared for him in case he wished to rest. There he took off his shirt, sat on the edge of the cot,  
and at three-fifteen in the afternoon took his pistol and shot himself in the iodine circle that hi s 
personal physician had painted on his chest. At th at moment in Macondo Ú rsula took the cover off 
the pot of milk on the stove, wondering why it wa s taking so long to boil, and fo und it fu ll of 
worms. 
“They’ve killed Aureliano ,” she exclaimed. 
She looked toward the courtyard, obeying a habit of her solitude, and then she saw José Arcadio  
Buendía, soaking wet and sad in the ra in and much  older than when he had  died. “They shot him in  
the back,” Úrsula said more precisely, “and no one wa s charitable enough to close his eyes.” At dusk  
through her tears she sa w the swift and luminous di sks that crossed the sky like an exhalation an d 
she thought that it was a signal of death. She was still under the chestnut  tree,  sobbing at her 
 90GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
husband’s knees, when they brought in Colonel Aureliano Buendía, wrapped in a blanket that was  
stiff with dry blood and with his eyes o pen in rage. 
He was out of danger. The bullet had  followed such a nea t path that th e doctor was able to put a  
cord soaked in iodine in through the chest an d withdraw it from the back. “That was m y 
masterpiece, ” he said with satisfactio n. “It wa s the only p oint where a  bullet could pass through  
without har ming any vital organ.” Colonel Aureliano Buendía saw himself  surrounded by chari table 
novices who  intoned d esperate ps alms for the rep ose of his soul and then he  was sorry that he had  
not shot himself in the roof of the mouth as he had considered  doing if only to mock th e prediction 
of Pilar Tern era. 
“If I still had the authority,” he told the doctor, “I’d have you shot out of hand. Not for having 
saved my life but for having made a fool of me.” 
The failure of his death brought ba ck his lost  prestige in a few hours. The same people wh o 
invented the story th at he had sold the war for a  room with walls made of gold bric ks defined the 
attemp t at suicide as an act of honor and proclaimed him a martyr. Then, when he rejected th e 
Order of Merit awarded  him by the president o f the republic, even his most bitter enemies filed  
through the room asking him to withdraw recognit ion of the armistice and to start a new war. The 
house was filled with gifts meant as amends. Impr essed finally by the massi ve support of his former 
comrades in arms, Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not put aside the possibility of pleasin g them. O n 
the contrary,  at a certain moment he s eemed so en thusiastic with the idea of a new war that Colonel 
Gerineldo Márquez thou ght that he was only wai ting for a pretext to pro claim it. The pretext wa s 
offered, in fa ct, when the president of the republic  refused to award any military pensions to former 
combatan ts, Liberal or Conservative, until each case was examined by a special commission and the 
award approved by the congress. “That’s an  outrage,” thundered Colonel Aureliano Buendía. 
“They’ll die of old age waiting for the mail to come.” For the first time he left the rocker that Úrsula 
had bought for his convalescence, and, walking abou t the b edroom, he dicta ted a strong message to  
the president of the republic. In that telegram wh ich was never  made public, he denounced the first 
violation of the Treaty of Neerlan dia and threatened  to proclaim war to the death if the assignmen t 
of pensions was not resolved within two weeks. His attitude was so just that it allowed him to hop e 
even for the support of former Conservative comb atants. But the only reply from the government 
was the reinforcement of  the military guard that had been placed at the door of his ho use with the 
pretext of pr otecting him,  and th e pro hibition of a ll types of vis its, Similar methods were adopted all 
through the country with  other leader s who bore watching. It was an oper ation that was so timely,  
drastic, and effective tha t two mon ths after the armistice, when Colonel  Aureliano Buendía had 
recovered, his most dedicated conspir ators were d ead or exiled or had been  assimilated forever into 
public administration. 
Colonel Aureliano Buend ía left his room in December  and it was sufficient for him to look at th e 
porch in order not to think about war again. With a vitality that seemed impossible at her age, Úrsula 
had rejuvenated the hous e again. “Now they’re going to see wh o I am,” she said when s he saw th at 
her son was going to live. “There won’t be a better, more o pen house in all the wo rld than this 
madhouse.” She had it washed and painted, chan ged the furniture, restored the garden and planted 
new flowers,  and op ened doors and windows so th at the dazzling light of summer wou ld penetrate 
even into  the bedrooms.  She decreed  an end to  the numerou s superimposed periods of mourning 
and she herself exchanged her rigorous old gowns fo r youthful clothing. The music of the pianola 
again made the house merry. When she heard it, Am aranta thought of Pietr o Crespi, his evening 
gardenia, and his smell of lavender, and in the depths  of her withered hea rt a clean  rancor flourished,  
purified by time. One afternoon when she was trying to put the parlor in order, Úrsula asked for the 
help of the s oldiers who were guarding the house . The young commander of the guard gave them  
permission. Little by little, Úrsula be gan assigning them new chores. She invited them to eat, gav e 
 91GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
them clothing and shoes,  and taught them how to  read and write. When th e governmen t withdrew 
the guard, one of them continued living in the house and was in her service for many years. On New 
Year’s Day, driven mad by rebuffs from Remedi os the Beauty,  the young commander o f the guard 
was found dead under her window.

Chapter 10 
YEARS LATER on his deathbed Aureliano Segundo would remember the rainy afternoon in June 
when he went into the b edroom to meet his first son. Even though the child was languid and weepy, 
with no mar k of a Buendía, he did not have to think twice abou t naming him. 
“We’ll call him José Arcadio,” he said. 
Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful woman he ha d married the year before, agreed. Úrsula, on the 
other hand, could not conceal a vague feeling of do ubt. Throughout the long history of the family  
the insistent repetition of names had made her draw some co nclusions that seemed to  be certain.  
While the Aurelianos were withdrawn, but with l ucid minds, the José Arcadios were i mpulsive and  
enterprising, but they wer e marked with a tragic si gn. The only cases th at were impossible to classify 
were those of José Arc adio Segundo and Aurelia no Segundo. They were so much alike and so  
mischievous during childhood that no t even Santa Sofía de la Piedad  coul d tell them apart. On the 
day of their christening Amaranta  put bracelets  on them with their respective names  and dressed 
them in different colored clothing marked with  each one’s i nitials, but when they b egan to go to 
school they decided to exchange cl othing and bracelets and call each other  by opposite names. The 
teacher, Mel chor Escalo na, used to knowing José Ar cadio Segundo by his green shirt, went out of 
his mind wh en he discov ered that the latter wa s wearing Aureliano Segundo’s bracelet a nd that th e 
other one said, nevertheless, that his name was  Aureliano Segundo in spite of the fact that he wa s 
wearing the white shirt and the bracelet with José  Arcadio Segundo’s name. From then on he was  
never sure who was who. Even when they grew up  and life made them different. Úrsula still 
wondered if they thems elves might not have made a mistake in some moment of their intricate gam e 
of confusion and had become chang ed forever. Until the beginning of adolescence they were two 
synchronized machines. They would wake up at the same tim e, have the urge to go to the bathroo m 
at the sam e time, suffer the same ups ets in health , and th ey even dreamed  about th e same things. In  
the house, where it was thought that they coordin ated their actions with a simple desire to confuse, 
no one realized what really was happening until one day when Santa Sofía de la Piedad gave one of 
them a glass of lemonade and as soon as he tasted it the other one said that it needed sugar. Santa  
Sofía de la Piedad, who had indeed forgotten to put sugar in the lemon ade, told Úrsula about it. 
“That’s what they’re all li ke,” she said without sur prise. “crazy from birth.” In time thi ngs became 
less disordered. The one who came out of the game of conf usion with the name of  Aureliano 
Segundo gre w to monumental size like his grandfathers, and the one who kept the name of José 
Arcadio Segundo grew to be bony like the colonel, and the only thing they had in common was the 
family’s solitary air. Perhaps it was that crossing of stature, names, and ch aracter that made Úrsula  
suspect that they had b een shuffled like a deck of cards since ch ildhood. 
The decisive difference was revealed  in the mids t of the war, when José Arcadio Segundo asked  
Colonel Gerineldo Márquez to let him  see an execut ion. Against Úrsula’s better judgment his wishes  
were satisfied. Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand , shuddered at the mere idea of witnessing an 
execution. He preferred to stay home.  At the age of twelve he asked Úrsula what was in the locked 
room. “Pape rs,” she answered. “Melquíades’ books and the strange things that he wrote in his last 
years.” Instead of calming him, the answer increase d his curiosity. He demanded so much, promised  
with such insistence tha t he would not mistreat the things, that Úrsula, gave him the keys. No one 
had gone into the room again since they had take n Melquíades’ body out and had put on the door a  
padlock whose parts had become fused together with rust. But when Aureliano Segundo opened the 
windows a familiar light entered that seemed accu stomed to lighting the room every day and ther e 
was not th e slightest trace of dust  or cobwebs, with everythin g swept and  clean, b etter swept and  
 93GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
cleaner than on the day of the burial, and the ink had not drie d up in  the inkwell nor h ad oxidation 
diminished the shine of the metals no r had the em bers gone out under the water pipe where José 
Arcadio Buendía had vaporized mercury. On the shelves were the books bound in a cardboard-like  
material, pale, like tanned human skin, and the manuscripts were intact.  In spite of the room’s  
having been shut up for many years, the air seemed  fresher tha n in the res t of the house.  Everything 
was so recen t that several  weeks later, when Úrsul a went into the room with a pail of water and a  
brush to was h the floor, there was nothing for her to do. Aureliano Segundo was deep in the reading 
of a book. Although it had no cover and the title d id not appea r anywhere, the boy enjoyed the story 
of a woman  who sat at a table and  ate nothing but kernels of rice, wh ich sh e picked up with a pin,  
and the story of the fisherman who borrowed a wei ght for his net from a neighbor a nd when he 
gave him a fish in payment later it ha d a diamond in its stomach, and the one about th e lamp tha t 
fulfilled wishes and abo ut flying carpets. Surprise d, he asked Úrsula if all that was tr ue and she 
answered hi m that i t was, that man y years ago th e gypsies had brought magic lamps and  flying mats 
to Macondo. 
“What’s hap pening,” she sighed, “is that th e world is slowly coming to an  end and tho se things  
don’t come here any mo re.” 
When he finished the book, in which many of the stories had no endings because there were 
pages missing, Aureliano Segundo se t about deci phering the manuscripts. It was impossible. The 
letters looked like clothes hung out to dry on a li ne and th ey looked more like musical notation th an 
writing. One hot noonti me, while he was poring over the, manuscripts, he sensed that he was no t 
alone in the room. Against the light from the window, sitting with his hands on his  knees, was  
Melquíades. He was und er forty years of age. He was wearing the same ol d-fashioned vest and the 
hat th at look ed like a raven’s wings,  and across his pale temples there flowed the grease fr om his hai r 
that h ad been melted  by the heat , just as Aureliano and José Arcadi o had  seen him  when they were 
children. Aureliano Segundo recognized him at once, becaus e that hered itary memory had been 
transmitted from generation to generation and had come to him through the memory of his 
grandfather. 
“Hello,” Aureliano Segundo said. 
“Hello, young man,” said Melquíades. 
From then on, for severa l years, they saw each other almost every afternoon. Melquía des talked  
to him abou t the world, tried to infuse him with  his old wisdom, but he refused to translate th e 
manuscripts. “No one must know their meaning unt il he has reached one hundred years  of age,” he 
explained. Aureliano kept those meetings secret f orever. On one occasion he felt that his private 
world had fallen apart because Úrsula came in wh en Melquíades was in the room. But she did not 
see him. 
“Who were you talking to?” she asked him. 
“Nobody,” Aureliano Segundo said. 
“That’s what your great-grandfather did,” Úrsul a, said. “He used to talk to h imself too.” 
José Arcadio Segundo, in the mean time, had satis fied his wish to see a sho oting. For the rest of  
his life he would remember the livid flash of the six sim ultaneous sh ots-and the echo of th e 
discharge as it broke against the hills and the sa d smile and perplexed eyes of the man being shot, 
who stood erect while his shirt became soaked with blood, an d who was still smiling even when they 
untied him from the post and put him in a box f illed with quicklime. “H e’s alive,” h e thought.  
“They’re going to bury him alive.” It made such an impres sion on him that from then on he 
detested mili tary practices and war, not because of the executions but because of the horrifying 
custom of burying the victims alive. No one knew then exactly when he began to ring the bells in 
the church tower and as sist Father Antonio Isa bel, the successor to “The Pup,” at mass, and take 
can of th e fighting cocks in the courtyard of  the parish house. When Col onel Gerinel do Márquez 
 94GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
found out he  scolded him  strongly for learning occupations repudiated  by the Liberals. “The fact is,” 
he answered , “I think I’ve turned out to be a Conservative.” He believed it as if it had been 
determined by fate. Colonel Gerineldo Már quez, scandalized, told Úrsula about it. 
“It’s better that way,” she approv ed. “Let’s hope that he becomes a priest so that God  will finally  
come into th is house.” 
It was soon discovered that Father Antonio Is abel was preparing him for his first communion.  
He was tea ching him the catechism as  he shaved the necks of his roosters. He  explained  to him wi th 
simple examples, as he put the brood ing hens into  their nests,  how it had  occurred to God on the 
second day of creation that chickens  would be fo rmed inside of an egg. From that time on the 
parish priest began to show the signs of senility th at would lead him to say years later that the devi l 
had probably won his rebellion against God, and that he was the one who sat on the heavenly 
throne, with out revealing his true identity in order to trap the u nwary. Warmed up by the persistence 
of his mentor, in a  few m onths José Arcadio Segund o came to be as adept in theological tricks used 
to confuse the devil as he was skilled in the tricks  of the cock pit. Amaranta made him a linen suit 
with a collar and tie, bought him a pair of white s hoes, and engraved his name in gilt letters on the 
ribbon of the candle. Two nights before the fi rst communion, Father Antonio Is abel closeted 
himself with him in the sacristy to h ear his confe ssion with the help of a dictionary of sins. It was 
such a long list that th e aged priest, used to going to  bed at six o’clock, fell asleep in his chair before 
it was over. The interrogation was a revelation for José Arcad io Segundo. It did not su rprise him 
that the priest asked him  if he had do ne bad things with wo men, and he h onestly ans wered no, but 
he was upset with the question as to whether he had done them with animals. The first Friday in 
May he received communion, tortured by curiosi ty. Later on he asked Petronio, the sickly sexton 
who lived in the belfry and who, according to what they said , fed himself on bats, about it, and 
Petronio, answered him: “There are  some corrupt  Christians who do their business with female 
donkeys.” José Arcadio Segundo still showed so mu ch curiosity and asked so many questions tha t 
Petronio lost his patience.  
“I go Tuesd ay nights,” he confessed. “if you promise not to tell an yone I’ll take you next 
Tuesday.” 
Indeed, on the following Tuesday Petronio came down out of the tower with a wood en stool  
which until then no one had known the use of, an d he took José Arcadio Segundo to a nearby 
pasture. The boy became so taken with those nocturn al raids that it was  a long time bef ore he was  
seen at Cata rino’s. He became a cockfight man.  “Take those creatures s omewhere el se,” Úrsula 
ordered him the first tim e she sa w him come in with  his fine fighting birds. “Roosters have alread y 
brought too much bitter ness to this house for you to bring us any more.” José Arcadio Segundo 
took them a way without any argument, but he continued breeding them  at the house of Pilar 
Ternera, his grandmother, who gave him everything he needed in exchange for having him in her 
house. He soon displayed in the cockpit the wisdom that Father Antonio Isabel had given him, and 
he made enough money not only to enrich his br ood but also to look for a man’s satisfactions . 
Úrsula compared him with his brother at that ti me and could not understa nd how the twins, who 
looked like t he same person in childhood, had ended up so differently. Her perplexity did not last 
very long, for quite soon Aureliano Segundo began to  show signs of laziness and dissipation. While 
he was shut up in Melquíades’ room he was dr awn into himself the way Colonel Aureliano Buendía 
had been in his youth. But a short ti me after th e Treaty of N eerlandia, a piece of cha nce took hi m 
out of his withdrawn self and made him face the reality of the world. A young woman who wa s 
selling numbers for the raffle of an accordion greeted him wi th a great deal of  familiarity. Aureliano  
Segundo was not surprise d, for he was frequently c onfused with his brother. But he did not clear up 
the mistake, not even wh en the girl  tried to soften his heart with sobs, and she ended ta king him to 
her room. She liked him so much from that first meeting tha t she fixed things so that h e would wi n 
 95GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
the accordio n in the raffle. At the end of two weeks Aureliano Segundo realized that the woman had  
been going to bed altern ately with hi m and his  brot her, thinking that they  were th e same man,  and 
instead of making things clear, he arranged to  prolong t he situation. He did not return to 
Melquíades’ room. He would spend his afternoons in the courtyard, learning to play the accordion 
by ear over the protests o f Úrsula, who at th at time had forbidden music in  the house b ecause of th e 
mourning a nd who, in addition, despised the a ccordion as an instrument worthy only of the 
vagabond heirs of Francisco the Man. Neverthele ss, Aureliano Segundo be came a virtuoso on the 
accordion and he still was after he had married and had children and was one of the most respected 
men in Macondo. 
For almost two months he shared th e woman with  his brother. He would watch him, mix up his  
plans, and when he wa s sure that José Arcadi o Segundo was not going to visit  their common 
mistress tha t night, he would go and sleep with  her. One morning he found that he wa s sick. Two  
days later he found his brother clinging to a beam in the bathroom, soaked in sweat and with tea rs 
pouring dow n, and then he understood. His brothe r confessed to him that the woman  had sent him  
away because he had given her what she called a low-life s ickness. He also told him how Pilar 
Ternera had  tried to cu re him. Aureliano Segund o submitted secretly to the burning baths of 
permanganate and to diuretic waters, and both were  cured separately after th ree month s of secret 
suffering. José Arcadio Segundo did not see th e woman again. Aureliano Segundo obtained her 
pardon and stayed wi th her until his death. 
Her name was Petra Cotes. She had arrived in Ma condo in the middle of the war with a chalice 
husband who lived off raffles, and when the man  died she kept up the business. She was a clean  
young mulatto woman with yellow almond-shaped eyes that gave her face the ferocity of a panther, 
but she had a generous heart and a magnificent vo cation for love. When Úrsula realized that José 
Arcadio Segundo was a  cockfight man and th at Au reliano Segundo played the accordion at his 
concubine’s noisy parties, she thought she would go mad with the combination. It was as if the 
defects of th e family and none of the virtues had b een con centr ated in both.  Then she d ecided tha t 
no one again would be called Aureliano or José Ar cadio. Yet when Aureliano Segundo had his first 
son she did not dare go against his will. 
“All right,” Úrsula said, “but on one condition: I will bring him up.” 
Although she was already a hundred years old and on the point of going b lind from cataracts, she 
still had her physical dynamism, her i ntegrity of ch aracter, and  her mental balance intact. No one 
would be better able tha n she to sha pe the virt uous man wh o would restore the pres tige of the 
family, a man who would never have heard talk of  war, fighting cocks, bad women, or wild 
undertakings, four calamities that, according to what Úrsula thought, had determined the downfall. 
of their line. “This one will be a priest,” she pro mised solemnly. “And if God gives m e life he’ll be 
Pope somed ay.” They all  laughed wh en they heard he r, not only in the bedroom but al l through the 
house, where Aureliano Segundo’s rowdy friends were gathered. The war, relegated to the attic o f 
bad memories, was momentarily recalled wi th the popping of champagne bottles. 
“To the heal th of the Pope,” Aureliano Segundo toasted. 
The guests toasted in a chorus. Then the man  of the house pla yed th e acco rdion, fireworks wer e 
set off, and drums celebrated the event throughout the to wn. At dawn the guests , soaked in  
champagne, sacrificed six cows and put them in th e street at the disposal of the crowd. No one was 
scandalized.  Since Aureliano Segundo had taken ch arge of the house those festivities were a  
common thi ng, even when there was  no motive as proper as the birth of a Pope. In a few years,  
without effort, simply by luck, he had accumulated one of the largest fortunes in the swamp thank s 
to the supernatural proliferation of his animals. Hi s mares would bear triplets, his hens laid twice a 
day, and his hogs fattened with such speed that no one could explain such disorderly fecundity 
except throu gh the use of black magic. “Save so mething now,” Úrsula would tell her wild great-
 96GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
grandson. “This luck is not going to last all yo ur life.” But A ureliano Segundo paid no attention to  
her. The more he opened champagne to soak his frie nds, the more wildly his animals ga ve birth and 
the more he was convinced that his lucky star was not a matter of his conduct but an influence of 
Petra Cotes, his concubine, whose love had the virtue of exasperating nature. So convinced was h e 
that this was  the origin of his fortune that he never kept Petra Cotes far away from his breeding 
grounds and even when he married a nd had child ren he conti nued living with her with the cons ent 
of Fernanda. Solid, mon umental like his grandfathers , but with a joie de vivre and an  irresistible 
good humor that they di d not hav e, Aureliano Segund o scarcely had time to l ook after  his animals.  
All he had to  do was to ta ke Petra Cores to his br eeding grounds and have her ride across his land in 
order to ha ve every an imal marked with his brand succu mb to th e irremediable plague of  
proliferation. 
Like all the good things that occurred in his long  life, that tremendous fortune had its origins in  
chance. Until the end of the wars Petra Cotes cont inued to support herself w ith the returns from her 
raffles and Aureliano Segundo was a ble to sack Úrsula’s savings from time to time. They were a 
frivolous couple, with no other wor ries except going to bed every night, even on forbidden days,  
and frolicking there until dawn. “That woman has been your ruination,” Úrsula would shout at her 
great-grandson when sh e saw him coming into the house li ke a sleepwalker. “She’s got you so 
bewitched  that one of these days I’m going to see you twisting around with colic and with a toad  in 
your belly.” José Arcadio Segundo, who took a long  time to d iscover that he had been supplanted, 
was unable to understand  his brother’s passion. He  rememb ered Petra Cotes as an ordin ary woman,  
rather lazy in  bed, and co mpletely la cking in any resources for lovemaking. Deaf to Úrs ula’s clamor 
and the teasi ng of his brother, Aureliano Segundo onl y thought at that tim e of finding a trade tha t 
would allow him to m aintain a house for Petra Cotes , and to  die with  her, o n top of h er and under-
neath her, during a night of feverish licen se. When Colonel Aureliano Buendía opened up his 
workshop again, seduced at last by the peaceful charms of old age, Aureliano Segundo t hought that 
it would be good business to devote himself to the manufactu re of little gold fishes. He spent many 
hours in the hot room watching ho w the hard sheets of metal, worked by the colo nel with the 
inconceivable patience of  disillusionment, were slowly being converted into golden scales. The work  
seemed so la borious to him and th e thought of Petr a Cotes was so persisten t and pressin g that after  
three weeks he disappeared from the  workshop. It wa s during that time that it occurr ed to  Petra 
Cotes to raffle off rabbits. They reproduced and grew up  so fast that there was barely time to sell the 
tickets for the raffle. At first Aureliano Segundo did not n otice th e alarming proportions of the 
proliferation. But one night, when nobody in town  wanted to hear about the rabbit raffle any more, 
he heard a noise by the courtyard door. “Don’t  get worried,” Petra, Cotes said. “It’s only the 
rabbits.” They could not sleep, tormented by the u proar of the animals. At dawn Aureliano Segundo 
opened the door and sa w the courtyard paved wi th rabbits, bl ue in th e glow of dawn.  Petra Cotes , 
dying with laughter, could not resist th e temptation  of teasing him. 
“Those are the ones who  were born last night,” she aid. 
“Oh my God!” he said. “Why don’t you raffle off cows?” 
A few days l ater, in an attempt to clea n out her courtyard, Petra Cotes exch anged the ra bbits for a 
cow, who two months later gave birth to triplets. That was ho w things began. Overnight Aureliano  
Segundo be. came the owner of land  and livestock and he barel y had time to enlarge his  overflowing  
barns and pigpens. It was a delirious prosperity that  even mad e him laugh, and he coul d not help 
doing crazy things to release his good humor. “Cea se, cows, l ife is short,” he would s hout. Úrsula 
wondered what entanglements he h ad got into, whether he might be stealing, whether he had 
become a ru stler, and every time she s aw him  unco rking champagne just for the pleasure of pouring  
the foam over his head, she would shout at him and scold him for the waste. It anno yed him so 
much that o ne day wh en he awoke in  a merry mo od, Aureliano Segundo appeared with  a chest full 
 97GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
of money, a can of paste,  and a brush,  and singing at the top of  his lungs the old songs of Francisco 
the Man, he papered the house inside and out an d from top to bottom, with one-peso banknotes.  
The old ma nsion, painted white since the tim e they had brought the pianola, took on the strang e 
look of a mosque. In the midst of the excitement of the family the scandalization of Úrsula, the joy 
of the peopl e cramming the street to watch th at apotheosis of squandering. Aurelia no Segundo 
finished by papering the house from  the front to the kitchen, including bathrooms and bedrooms,  
and threw th e leftover bills into the co urtyard. 
“Now,” he said in a final way, “I hope that nobod y in this hou se ever talks to me about money 
again.” 
That was what happened.  Úrsula had the bills take n down, stuck  to great cak es of whitewash, and 
the house was painted  white again. “ Dear Lord,”  she begged, “make us po or again the way we were 
when we founded this town so that you will not collect for this squandering in the other life.” He r 
prayers wer e answered in reverse. One of the workmen removing the bills bumped into an 
enormous plaster statue of Saint Jose ph that someone had left in the house during the last years of  
the war and the hollow figure broke to pieces  on the floor. It h ad been  stuffed with gol d coins. No  
one could remember who had brought that life-si zed saint. “Three men brought it,” Amaranta  
explained. “They asked  us to keep it until the rai ns were over and I  told them to  put it there in th e 
corner wher e nobody would bump into it, and there th ey pu t it, very car efully, and there it’s been 
ever since because th ey never came back for it.”  Later on, Úrsula had put candles on it and had  
prostrated h erself before it, not sus pecting that instead of a saint she was adoring almost fou r 
bundled pounds of gold. The tardy evidence of he r involuntary paganism made her  even more 
upset. She spat on the spectacular pile of coins, put them in three canvas sacks, and buried them in a 
secret place, hoping that sooner or later the thr ee unknown men would come to reclaim them. Much 
later, during the difficult years of her  decrepitud e, Úrsula would intervene i n the conver sations of 
the many tra velers who came by th e house at tha t time and as k them if they had left a plaster Saint 
Joseph there during the war to be taken care of until the rains passed. 
Things like that which gave Úrsula  such c onsternation, were commonplace in those days.  
Macondo was swamp ed in a miracu lous prosperity. The ado be houses o f the founders had been  
replaced by brick buildings with wooden blinds and cemen t floors which made the suf focating heat  
of two o’clock in the afternoon more bearable. All that remained at that time of José Arcadio 
Buendía’s ancient village were the dusty almond tr ees, destined to resist the most arduous of 
circumstances, and the ri ver of clear water whos e prehistoric stones had been pulverized by th e 
frantic hammers of José Arcadio Segundo when he set about opening the channel  in order to 
establish a boat line. It was a mad dream, compara ble to thos e of hi s great-grandfather, for the rocky 
riverbed and the numero us rapids prevented naviga tion from Macondo to the sea. But José Arcadio 
Segundo, in an unforeseen burst of temerity, stub bornly kept on with the pr oject. Unti l then h e had 
shown no sign of imagination. Except for his pre carious adventure with Petra Cotes, he had never  
known a woman. Úrsula had considered him the qui etest exam ple the family had ever produced i n 
all its history, incapable of standing out even as  a handler of fighting cocks, when Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía told him the story of the Spanish galleon aground eight miles from  the sea, the carbonized  
frame of which he had seen himself during the war.  The story, which for so many years had seemed 
fantastic to so many people, was a revelation for José Arcadio Segundo. He auctioned off his  
roosters to the highest b idder, recruited men, bo ught tools, and set abou t the aweso me task o f 
breaking stones, digging canals, clearing away rapi ds, and even harnessing wa terfalls. “I know all of 
this by heart,” Úrsula would shout. “It’s as if time had turned around and we were back at the  
beginning.” When he thought that the river was n avigable, José Ar cadio Segundo gave his brother a 
detailed acco unt of his plans and the latter gave him the mon ey he need ed for the enterprise. He 
disappeared for a long time. It had b een said that  his plan to buy a boat was nothing but a trick to 
 98GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
make off with his brother’s money when the news spread that a strange craft was approaching the 
town. The inhabitants of Macondo, who no longer remember ed the colos sal undertakings of José  
Arcadio Buendía, ran to the riverbank and saw with eyes poppi ng in disbelief the arrival of the first 
and last boat ever to dock in the town. It was not hing but a log raft drawn by thick ropes pulled by  
twenty men  who walked along the ba nk. In the p row, with a glow of satisfaction in his eyes, Jos é 
Arcadio Segundo was directing the arduous maneuv er. There arrived with him a rich group of 
splendid matrons who were protecting themselves  from the burning sun with gaudy parasols, and 
wore on their shoulders fine silk kerchiefs, with colored creams on their faces and natu ral flowers in 
their hair and golden serpents on their arms an d diamonds in their teeth. The log raft was the only 
vessel that J osé Arcadio  Segundo was able to b ring to Macondo, and only once, b ut he never  
recognized the failure of his enterprise, but proclaim ed his deed as a victory of will power. He gave a 
scrupulous accounting to his brother and very soon plunged ba ck into the routine of cockfights. The  
only thing th at remain ed of that unfor tunate vent ure was the b reath of ren ovation tha t the m atrons  
from France brought, as their magnificent arts tr ansformed traditional methods of love and their  
sense of social well-being abolished Catarino’s antiqua ted place a nd turned th e street into a bazaar of  
Japanese lanterns and nostalgic hand organs. Th ey were the pr omoters of the bloody ca rnival that 
plunged Macondo into delirium for three days and whose only l asting consequence was having given  
Aureliano Segundo the opportunity to meet Fern anda del Car pio. 
Remedios th e Beauty was proclaimed queen. Úrsula, who shuddered at the disquieted beauty of  
her great-granddaughter, could not prevent the ch oice. Until then she had succeeded in  keeping her 
off the streets unless it was to go to mass with Amaranta, b ut she mad e her cover h er face with a  
black shawl. The most impious men, those who would disguise themselves as priests to say 
sacrilegious masses in Catarino’s store, would go to ch urch with an aim to  see, if only fo r an instan t, 
the face of Remedios the Beauty, whose legen dary good looks were s poken of with alarming  
excitemen t throughout the swamp. It was a long ti me before they were ab le to do so, and it would 
have been  better for th em if they never had, beca use most of them  never recovered th eir peacefu l 
habits of sl eep. The man who made it possible, a foreigner, lost his serenity forever, became 
involved in the sloughs o f abjection a nd misery, a nd years  later was cu t to pi eces b y a train after he 
had fallen asleep on th e tracks. From the momen t he was seen in the church, wearing a green velvet 
suit and an embroidered vest, no one doubted that  he came from far a way, perhaps from some 
distant city o utside of the country, attr acted by th e magical fascination of Remedios the Beauty. H e 
was so handsome, so elegant and dignified, with su ch presence, that Pietro Crespi would have been  
a mere fop beside him and many women whisper ed with spiteful smiles that he was the one wh o 
really should have worn the shawl. He did not sp eak to anyone in Macond o. He appeared at dawn 
on Sunday li ke a prince i n a fairy tale,  riding a horse  with  silver stirrups and a velvet bla nket, and h e 
left town after mass. 
The power o f his presence was such that from the first time he was seen in the church everybody 
took it for granted tha t a silent and tense duel had been estab lished between him and Remedios the 
Beauty, a secret pact, an  irrevocable challenge that would end not only in l ove but also in death. On 
the sixth Sunday the gentleman appear ed with a ye llow rose in his hand. He heard mass standing, as 
he alwa ys di d, and at th e end h e stepped in front of Remedios the Beauty and offered her the 
solitary rose. She took i t with a natur al gesture, as if she had been prepar ed for that homage, and  
then she uncovered her face and gave her thanks wi th a smile.  That was all she did. Not only for the 
gentleman, but for all the men who had the unfortunate privilege of s eeing her, that wa s an eterna l 
instant. 
From then on the gentleman had a band of musici ans play beside the window of Remedios the 
Beauty, som etimes until dawn. Aureliano Segundo was the onl y one who felt a cordial compassion  
for him and he tried to b reak his perseverance. “D on’t waste your time any more,” he told him one 
 99GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
night. “The women in th is house are worse than mules.” He offered him his friendship, invited him 
to bathe in champagne, tried to mak e him under stand that the females of his family had insides 
made of flint, but he could not weaken his obsti nacy. Exasp erated by th e interminab le nights of 
music, Colonel Aureliano Buendía threatened to cure his afflic tion with a f ew pistol shots. Nothing 
made him d esist except his own lamentable s tate of demoralization. From  a well-dressed and neat 
individual he  became filthy and ragged . It was ru mored that he had abandoned power and fortune in 
his distant nation, althou gh his origins were actu ally never known. He became argumentative, a 
barroom brawler, and he would wake up rolling in hi s own filth in Catarino’s store. The saddest part 
of his drama was that Remedios the Beauty did not notice hi m not ev en when he app eared in chur ch 
dressed like a prince. She accepted th e yellow rose wi thout the least bit of malice, amused, rather, by 
the extravaga nce of the act, and she lifted her sh awl to see his face better, not to show hers . 
Actually, Remedios the Beauty was not a creatu re of this world. Until she was well  along in 
puberty Santa Sofía de la. Piedad had to bathe and  dress her, and even when she could take care o f 
herself it was necessary to keep an eye on her so that she woul d not paint little animals on the walls 
with a stick daubed in her own excrement. She reached twenty without knowing how to read or 
write, unable to use the s ilver at the table, wander ing naked th rough the h ouse becaus e her na ture 
rejected all manner of convention. When the yo ung commander of the guard declared his love for 
her, she rejected him si mply becaus e his frivolity startled h er. “See how simple he i s,” she told 
Amaranta. “He says that he’s dying because of me, as if I were a bad case of colic.” When, indeed,  
they found him dead besi de her window, Remedios  the Beauty confirmed her first impression. 
“You see,” she commen ted. “He was a complete Simpleton.” 
It seemed  as if some penetrating lucidity permit ted her to s ee the reality of things beyond any 
formalism. That at least was the point of vi ew of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, for whom Remedios  
the Beauty was in no way mentally retarded, as was generally believed, but quite the opposi te. “It’s as 
if she’s come back from twenty years  of war,” he  would say. Úrsula, for her part, thanked God for 
having awarded the fam ily with a cr eature of exceptional pu rity, but a t the sam e time she wa s 
disturbed by her beauty, for it seemed a contradictory virtue to her, a diabolical trap at the center of  
her innocence. It was for that reason that she decide d to keep her away from the world, to protect 
her from all earthly temptation, not knowing that Remedios th e Beauty, ev en from the time wh en 
she was in her mother’s womb, was safe from any contagion. It never entered her head that they 
would elect her beauty q ueen of the carnival pand emonium. But Aureliano, Segundo, excited at th e 
caprice of di sguising him self as a tig er, brought Father Anto nio Isabel to the h ouse in order to  
convince Úrsula that the carnival was not a pagan feas t, as she said, but a Catholic tradition. Finally 
convinced, even though reluctantly, sh e consented to the coron ation. 
The news th at Remedios Buendía was  going to be the sovereign ruler of the festival went beyond  
the limits of the swamp i n a few hour s, reached di stant pla ces where th e prestige of her  beauty was  
not known, and it aroused the anxi ety of those who still thought of her last name as a symbol of  
subversion. The anxiety was baseless. If anyone had become h armless at that time it was the aging 
and disillusioned Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who was sl owly losing all contact with the reality of  
the nation. Enclosed in his workshop, his only  relationship with the rest of the world was hi s 
business in little gold fishes. One of the soldiers who had guarded his house during the first days of 
peace would go sell them in the villages of the sw amp and retur n loaded down with coins and news. 
That the Co nservative government, he would say, with the backing of the Liberals, was reforming 
the calend ar so that ev ery president co uld remain in power for a hundred years. That the concordat 
with the Ho ly See had finally been si gned and a cardinal had come from Rome with  a crown o f 
diamonds and a throne of solid gold, and that th e Liberal ministers had had  their pictures taken o n 
their knees i n the act of kissing his ring. That th e leading lady of a Spanis h company pas sing through 
the ca pital h ad been  kidnapped by a b and of mask ed highwaymen and o n the following Sunday she 
 100GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
had danced in the nude at the summ er house of the president of the republic. “Don’t talk to me 
about politics,” the colonel would tell him. “Our b usiness is selling little fis hes.” The rumor that he 
did not want to hear anything about the situation in  the countr y because h e was growin g rich in his 
workshop made Úrsula laugh when i t reached her ears. With her terrible practical sense she could  
not understa nd the colon el’s business as he exchan ged little fishes for gold coins and then converted  
the coins into little fishes, and so on, with the resu lt that h e had to work all the harder with the mor e 
he sold in order to satisfy an exasperating vicio us circle. Actual ly, what interested him was not th e 
business but the work. He need ed so much con centration to  link scales, fit minute rubies into the  
eyes, laminate gills, and p ut on fins th at there was not  the smallest empty moment left for him to fill 
with his disillusionment of the war. So absorbin g was the attention required by the delicacy of his 
artistry that in a short ti me he h ad aged more th an during all the years of the war, and his position 
had twisted his spine and the close work had used up his eyesight, but the implacabl e concentra tion 
awarded him  with a peace of the spirit. The last time  he was s een to take a n interest in some matter  
related to th e war was when a group of veteran s from both parties sought his support for the 
approval of lifetime pensi ons, which had always  been  promised and were always about to be put into 
effect. “Forget about it,” he told them . “You can s ee how I refuse my pension in order to get rid of 
the torture o f waiting for it until the d ay I died.”  At first Colonel Gerineldo Márquez would visit him 
at dusk and they would both sit in the street do or and talk a bout the p ast. But Amara nta could no t 
bear the m emories that that man, wh ose baldness  had plunged him into the abyss of pr emature old 
age, aroused in her, and she would torment him with snide remarks until he did n ot come back  
except on s pecial occasions and he finally disappeared , extinguished by paralysis. Taciturn, silent,  
insensible to the new brea th of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendía could  
understand only that the secret of a good old a ge is simply  an honorable pact with solitude. He 
would get u p at five in the morning after a light  sleep, have his eternal mug of bitter coffee in the 
kitchen, shut himself up all day in the workshop, an d at four in the afternoon he would g o along the 
porch dragging a stool, n ot even no ticing the fire of  the rose bu shes or the brightness of the hour or  
the persisten ce of Amaranta, whose melancholy made  the noi se of a boiling pot, which was perfectly 
percepti ble at dusk, and he would sit in the street door as long as the mos quitoes would allow him  
to. Someone dared to disturb his solitude once. 
“How are you, Colonel?” he asked in passing. 
“Right here,” he answered. “Waiting for my funeral procession to pass.” 
So that the a nxiety caus ed by the pub lic reappear ance of his fa mily name,  having to do with th e 
coronation o f Remedios the Beauty, was baseless.  Many people did not think that way,  however.  
Innocent of the tragedy that threatened it, the town poured into the main square in a noisy 
explosion of merriment. The carnival had reac hed its highest level of madness and Aureliano 
Segundo had satisfied at last his drea m of dressin g up like a tiger and was walking along the wild 
throng, hoarse from so much roaring, when on the swamp road a parade of several pe ople appeared  
carrying in a gilded litter the most fascinatin g woman  that imaginatio n could con ceive. For a  
moment th e inhabitants  of Macond o took off thei r masks in order to get a better  look at the 
dazzling creature with a crown of emeralds an d an ermine cape, wh o seemed invested with 
legitimate au thority, and was not mer ely a sovere ign of bangles and crepe paper. There were man y 
people who  had sufficient insight to  suspect that it  was a qu estion of provocation. But Aureliano  
Segundo immediately conquered his perplexity and d eclared the new arrivals to be guests of honor, 
and with th e wisdom of Solomon he seated R emedios the Beauty and the intruding queen on th e 
same dais. U ntil midnight the stranger s, disguised as bedouins, took part in the delirium and even 
enriched it with sumptuous fireworks and acrobatic skills th at made one think of the art of the  
gypsies. Suddenly, during the paroxys m of the celebration, someone broke the delicate b alance. 
“Long live the Liberal party!” he shou ted. “Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendía!” 
 101GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
The rifle shots drowned o ut the spl endor of the fireworks and th e cries of ter ror drowned out th e 
music and joy turned into panic. Many years later there were those who still insisted that the royal 
guard of the intruding queen was  a squad of regu lar army soldiers who wer e concealing government-
issue rifles under their rich Moorish robes. Th e government denied the charge in a special  
proclamatio n and promised a complete investigation of the bloody episode. But the truth never 
came to  light, and the ver sion always p revailed that  the royal guard, without provocation of any kind, 
took up combat positions  upon a signal from their commander  and opened  fire without pity on the 
crowd. When calm was restored, not  one of the false bedouins remained  in town  and there were  
many dead and wounded lying on the  square: nine  clowns, four Columbines, seventeen playing-card  
kings, one devil, three minstrels, two peers of Fr ance, and three Japanese empresses. In the confu-
sion of the panic José Arcadio Segundo managed to rescue Remedios the Beauty and Aureliano 
Segundo carried the intr uding queen to the hous e in his arms, her dress torn and the ermine cap e 
stained with blood. Her name was Fernanda del Carp io. She had been chos en as the mo st beautiful 
of the five thousand most beau tiful women in th e land and they had brought her to Macondo wi th 
the promise of naming her Queen of  Madagascar. Úrsula took care of her as if she were her own 
daughter. The town, ins tead of dou bting her inno cence, piti ed her cand or. Six months after the 
massacre, when the wou nded had recovered and  the last flowers on the mass grave had withered, 
Aureliano Segundo went to fetch her from the distan t city wh ere she lived with her father and he 
married her in Macondo with a noisy celebration that lasted twenty days. 
 102GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Chapter 11 
THE MARRIAGE was on the poin t of breaking up after two  months becaus e Aureliano Segundo, in 
an attemp t to placate Petra Cotes, had a picture ta ken of her dressed as the Queen of Madagascar.  
When Fernanda found out about it s he repacked her bridal trunks and left Macondo without saying 
good-bye. Aureliano Segundo caught up with he r on the swamp road. After much pleading and  
promises of reform he succeeded in g etting her to come home and he aban doned his co ncubine. 
Petra Cotes, aware of her strength, showed no sign s of worry. She had made a man of him. While 
he was still a child she had drawn him out of Melq uíades’ room, his head full of fantastic ideas and 
lacking any contact with r eality, and she had given him a place in the world. Nature had made him  
reserved and withdrawn. with tendencies toward  solitary meditation, and she had molded a n 
opposite character in him, one that was vital, expa nsive, open, and she had injected him with a jo y 
for living and a pleasure in spending and celebratin g until she had converted  him inside and out, into 
the m an she had drea med of for herself ever since adoles cence. Then h e married, as a ll sons marry 
sooner or lat er. He did n ot dare tell her the news. He assum ed an attitude that was quite childis h 
under the circumstances, feigning anger and imagin ary resentm ent so that Petra Cotes would be the 
one who would bring about the break. One day, when Aureliano Segundo reproached her unjustly, 
she eluded the trap and put things in their proper place. 
“What it all means,” she said, “is that you want to marry the qu een.” 
Aureliano Segundo, ashamed, preten ded an attack of rage, said that he was misunderstood an d 
abused, and did not visit her again. Pe tra Cotes, wi thout losing her poise of a wild beast in repose 
for a single instant, hear d the music and the fir eworks from the wedding, the wild bu stle of the 
celebration a s if all of it were nothin g but some new piece o f mischief on the part of Aureliano 
Segundo. Those who p itied her fate were calm ed with a  smile. “Don’t worry,” she told them. 
“Queens run errands for me.” To a neighbor woman who brought her a set of candles so that she 
could light up the picture of her lost lover wi th them, she said with an enigmatic security: 
“The only ca ndle that will  make him come is always lighted.” 
Just as she had foreseen, Aureliano Segundo went back to her house as soon as the honeymoon 
was over. He brought his usual old friends, a trav eling photographer, and the gown and ermine cape 
soiled with blood that F ernanda had  worn during the carnival. In the heat of the m erriment that 
broke out that evening, he had Petra Cotes dre ss up as queen, crowned her absolute and lifetime 
ruler of Madagascar, and handed out copies of th e picture to his friends, she not only went along 
with the game, but she felt sorry for him inside, thin king that he must have been very frightened to  
have conceived of that ex travagant means of reconc iliation. At seven in the evening, still dressed as 
the queen, s he received him in bed. He had been  married sca rcely two m onths, but s he realized a t 
once that th ings were not going well in the nuptial bed, and she had the delicious pleasure of 
vengeance fulfilled. Two  days later, however, when he  did not dare return but sent an intermediary 
to arrange the terms of the separatio n, she unders tood that s he was going to need more patience 
than she had  foreseen because he seemed ready to  sacrifice hi mself for the sake of app earances. No r 
did she get upset that tim e. Once agai n she made things easy with a submission that co nfirmed the 
generalized belief that s he was  a po or devil, and the only souvenir  she kept of Aureli ano Segund o 
was a pair of patent leather boots, which, according to what he himself had said, were t he ones he 
wanted  to wear in his co ffin. She kept them wr apped in cloth  in the botto m of a trunk and m ade 
ready to feed  on memories, waiting without despair. 
“He has to come sooner or later,” she told hersel f, “even if it’s just to put on those boots. ” 
 103GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
She did not have to wait as long as she had imagined. Actuall y, Aureliano Segundo understood  
from the night of his wedding that he would retu rn to the house of Petr a Cotes much sooner than 
when he would have to put on the patent leather boots: Fernanda  was a woman who was lost in the  
world. She had been bo rn and raised in a city s ix hundred miles away, a gloomy city where o n 
ghostly nights the coaches of the vi ceroys still rattled through the cobb led streets, Thirty-two 
belfries tolled a dirge at six in the afternoon. In the manor house, which was paved with tomblike 
slabs, the sun was never  seen. The air had died in the cypr esses in the courtyard, in the pal e 
trappings of the bedrooms, in th e dripping archways of the gard en of perennials. Until puberty 
Fernanda had no news of the world except fo r the melancholy piano lessons taken in some 
neighboring house by someone who fo r years and years had the drive not to take a si esta. In the 
room of her sick mother, green and yellow unde r the powder y light from  the windowpanes, she 
would listen to the methodical, stubborn, heartless sc ales and think that that music was in the world 
while she was being co nsumed as  she wove funera l wreath s. Her moth er, perspiring with five-
o’clock fever, spoke to her of the splendor of the past. When she was a little girl, on one moonli t 
night Fernanda saw a bea utiful wo man dressed in  white crossing th e garden  toward th e chapel. What 
bothered her  most about that fleeting vision was that she felt i t was exactly like her, as if she ha d 
seen herself twenty years  in advance. “It was your  great-grandmother the queen,” her mother told  
her during a truce in her coughing. “She died of some bad vap ors while she was cuttin g a string of 
bulbs.” Many years later, when she began to f eel she was the equal of her great-grandmother , 
Fernanda doubted her childhood vision, but her mother scolded her disbelief. 
“We are immensely rich and powerful,” she told her. “One day you will be a queen.” 
She believed it, even though they were sitting at th e long table with a linen tablecloth a nd silver 
service to h ave a cup o f watered ch ocolate and  a sweet bun . Until the day of her wedding she 
dreamed ab out a legend ary kingdom, in spite of  the fa ct tha t her fath er, Don Ferna ndo, had to  
mortgage the house in order to buy her trousseau. It was not innocence or delusions of grandeur. 
That was how they had brought her up. Since she had had the use of reason she remembered having 
done her duty in a gold pot with the f amily crest o n it. She left the house for the first time at th e age 
of twelve in a coa ch and  horses that  had to travel  only two bl ocks to  take her to the convent. Her 
classmates were surprised that she sat apart from th em in a chair with a very high back and that she 
would not even mingle with them during recess. “She’s different,” the nuns would e xplain. “She’s  
going to be a queen.” Her schoolmates believed this  because she was alr eady the most beautiful, 
distinguished, and discreet girl they had ever seen. At the end of eight years, after having learned to  
write Latin poetry, play the clav ichord, talk about falconry with gentlemen and ap ologetics, with  
archbishops, discuss affairs of state with foreign rulers and affairs of G od with the Pope, she 
returned to her parents’ home to  weave funeral wreath s. She found it despoiled.  All tha t was left wa s 
the furniture that was ab solutely necessary, the silver  candelab ra and table service, for the everyda y 
utensils had been sold one by one to underwrite the costs of her educati on. Her mother had suc-
cumbed to  five-o’clock fever. Her father, Don Fe rnando, dressed in black with a stiff collar and a  
gold watch chain, would  give her a silver co in on Mondays for the household expenses, and the 
funeral wreaths finished the week before would be ta ken away. He spent mo st of his time shut up in 
his study an d the few ti mes tha t he went ou t he woul d return to recite th e rosary with her. She had  
intimate friendships with no one. She had never heard mentio n of the wars that were bleeding the 
country. She continued  her piano less ons at three in the afternoon. She had even began to lose the 
illusion of being a queen  when two peremptory raps  of the knocker sounded at the door and sh e 
opened it to a well-groomed military officer with  ceremonious manners who had a scar on his cheek  
and a gold m edal on his chest. He clos eted himself with her fath er in the stu dy. Two hou rs later her  
father came to get her in the sewing room. “Get your  things together,” he told her. “You have to  
take a long trip.” That was how th ey took her to Ma condo. In one single day, with a brutal slap, lif e 
 104GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
threw on top of her the whole weight of a realit y that her parents had k ept hidden f rom her for 
many years. When she returned home she shut herself up in her room to weep, indifferent to Don 
Fernando’s pleas and ex planations as  he tried to erase the scar s of that stra nge joke. She had sworn 
to herself never to leave her bedroom until she di ed when Aureliano Segundo came to get her. It 
was an  act o f impossible fate, becaus e in the confu sion of her i ndignation, in the fury of her shame, 
she had lied to him so that he would never know he r real identity. The onl y real clues that Aurelian o 
Segundo had when he left to look for her were her unmistakable highland accent and h er trade as a 
weaver of funeral wreath s. He search ed for her without ceas e. With the fierce temerity with which  
José Arcadi o Buendía h ad crossed the mountain s to found Macondo, with the blind  pride with 
which Colonel Aureliano Buendía had undertaken his fruitless wars, with the mad tenacity with  
which Úrsula watched over the survival of the line,  Aureliano Segundo looked for Fernanda, withou t 
a single moment of respite. When he asked wher e they sold funeral wreaths they took him from  
house to house so that he could choose the best ones. When he asked for t he most beautiful woman 
who had  ever been seen on this earth, all the wom en brought h im their dau ghters. He b ecame lost in  
misty byways, in times reserved for oblivion, in labyrinths of disappointment. He cros sed a yellow 
plain where the echo rep eated one’s thoughts an d where anxiety brought on premonitory mirages.  
After sterile weeks he came  to an unknown city wh ere all the bells were tolling a dirge . Although he 
had never s een them and  no one had  ever des cribed them to  him he im mediately recognized th e 
walls eaten away by bone salt, the bro ken-down w ooden balco nies gutted by fungus, and nailed to  
the outside door, almost erased by ra in, the saddest cardboard  sign in the world: Funeral Wreath s for 
Sale. From that moment until the icy morning when Fernanda left her hou se under the care of the 
Mother Superior there was barely enough time for the nuns to sew her trousseau and i n six trunks 
put the cand elabra, the silver service, and the gold  chamber pot along with the countless and useless  
remains of a family catastrophe that had been two centuries l ate in its fulfillment. Don Fernando 
declined the invitation to go along. He promised to go later when he had cleared up his affairs, and 
from the moment when he gave his daughter his bl essing he shut himself up in his st udy again to 
write out the announcements with  mournful sketches  and the family coat of arms, whi ch would b e 
the first human contact that Fernanda and her father  would have had in all their lives. That was the 
real date of h er birth fo r her. For Aurel iano Segu ndo it was almost simultaneously the beginning and  
the end of happiness. 
Fernanda ca rried a delicate calendar with small golden keys o n which her  spiritual adviser had 
marked in purple ink the dates of venereal abst inence. Not co unting Holy week, Sundays, holy days 
of obligation, first Fridays, r etreats, sacrifices, and cyclical impediments,  her effective year was  
reduced to  forty-two days that were s pread out th rough a web of purple crosses. Aureliano Segundo,  
convinced that time wo uld break up that host ile network, prolonged the wedding celebration be-
yond the expected time.  Tired of throwing out so  many emp ty brandy an d champagn e bottles so  
that they would not clutter up the house and at the same time intrigued by the fact that th e 
newlyweds s lept at different times an d in separate rooms whi le the fireworks and music and the 
slaughtering of cattle wen t on, Úrsula remem bered her own experience and  wondered whether Fer -
nanda might have a chas tity belt too which would s ooner or later provoke jokes in the town and give 
rise to a tragedy. But Fernanda confessed to her that she was just letting two weeks go by before 
allowing the first contact with her h usband. Indeed, when the period was over, she opened her  
bedroom wi th a resignation worthy of an expi atory victim a nd Aurelian o Segundo saw the most 
beautiful woman on earth, with her glorious eyes of a frightened animal  and her long, copper-
colored hair spread out across the pillow. He was so  fascinated with that vision that it took him a 
moment to r ealize tha t Fernanda was  wearing a white nightgown that rea ched down to  her ankles, 
with long sleeves and with a large, round buttonh ole, delicatel y trimmed, a t the level o f her lower 
stomach. Au reliano Segundo could not suppress an explosion of laughter. 
 105GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“That’s the most obscen e thing I’ve ever seen  in my life,” h e shouted  with a laugh that rang  
through the house. “I married a Sister of Charity.” 
A month la ter, unsucces sful in getting his wife to take off her nightgown, he had th e picture 
taken of Petra Cotes dressed as a queen. Later on, when he succeeded in getting Fernanda to come 
back home,  she gave in to his ur ges in the fever of reconciliation,  but she could not g ive him the  
repose he h ad dreamed  about wh en he wen t to f etch her in the city with  the thirty-two belfries. 
Aureliano Segundo found only a deep feeling of deso lation in her. One ni ght, a short time before 
their first ch ild was born , Fernanda realized that her husband  had returned in secret to the bed of 
Petra Cotes. 
“That’s what happened,”  he admitted . And he explai ned in a tone of pros trated resignation: “I 
had to do it s o that th e animals would keep on breeding.” 
He need ed a little time to convin ce her  about such  a strange exp edient, but when he finall y did so 
by means of  proofs that seem ed irrefutable, th e only promise that Fernanda demand ed from him 
was that he should not be surprised by death in hi s concubine’s bed. In that way the thr ee of them 
continued living without bothering each other. Aure liano Segundo, punctual and loving with both of 
them. Petra Cotes, strutti ng because o f the reconci liation, and Fernanda, pretending that she did not 
know the tru th. 
The pact did  not succeed , however, in  incorporating Fernanda into the family. Úrsula insisted i n 
vain that sh e take off the woolen  ruff which she would have o n when  she got up from making love 
and which made the neighbors whisper. She could not convince her to use the bathr oom or the 
night lavatory and sell th e gold cham berpot to C olonel Aureliano Buendía  so that h e could convert 
it into little fishes. Amaranta felt so uncomforta ble with her defective dicti on and her habit of using 
euphemisms to designate everything that she woul d always speak gibberish in front of her. 
“Thifis if.” she would say, “ifis if one fos ofosi f thofosif whosufu cantanta nt statan tand thefesef  
smufumellu ofosif therisir owfisown shifisifit.” 
One day, irritated by the mockery, Fernanda want ed to know what Amara nta was saying, and she 
did not use euphemisms in answering her. 
“I was saying,” she told her, “that yo u’re one of those people who mix up their ass a nd their  
ashes.” 
From that time on they did not speak to each othe r again. When circumstances deman ded it they 
would send notes. In spite of the visible hostility of the family, Fernanda did not give up her drive to 
impose the customs of her ancestor s. She put a n end to the custom of eating in the kitchen and  
whenever an yone was hu ngry, and she imposed the obligation of doing it at regular hours at the 
large table in the dining room, covered with a li nen cloth and with silver candlesticks and table 
service. The solemnity o f an act whi ch Úrsula ha d considered the most simple one of daily life 
created a tense atmosph ere against which the sile nt José Arcadio Segundo rebelled before anyone 
else. But the custom was i mposed, the same as tha t of reciting the rosary before dinner, and it drew 
the attention  of the neighbors, who soon spread the rumor that the Buendías  did not sit down to th e 
table like other mortals but had chan ged the act of eating in to a ki nd of high mass. Even Úrsula’s  
superstitions, with origins that came more from an  inspiration of the moment than from tradition, 
came into co nflict with those of Fernanda, who had inherited them from her parents and kept them  
defined and catalogued for every occasion. As long  as Úrsula  had full use of her faculties some of  
the old custo ms survived and the life of the family ke pt some q uality of her impulsiveness, but when 
she lost h er sight and th e weight of her years relega ted her to a corner, the circ le of rigidity begun by 
Fernanda from the mom ent she arrived finally closed completely and no one but she determined the 
destiny of the family. Th e business in  pastries and small candy animals that Santa Sofía d e la Piedad 
had kept up because of Úrsula’s wishes was consid ered an unworthy acti vity by Fernanda and she 
lost no time in putting a stop to it. The doors of the house, wide open from dawn until bedtime, 
 106GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
were closed during siesta time un der the pretext th at the sun  heated  up th e bedrooms an d in the end  
they were closed for good. The aloe branch and l oaf of bread that had been hanging over the door  
since the days of the founding were replaced by  a niche with the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Colonel 
Aureliano, Buendía became aware s omehow of  those chan ges and foresaw their consequences . 
“We’re becoming people of quality,” he protested.  “At this  rate we’ll end  up fighting against th e 
Conservative regime again, but this time to install a king in its place.” Fernanda very tactfully tried  
not to cross his path. Within herself she was bothere d by his independent spirit his resistance to all 
kinds of social rigidity. She was exa sperated by his mugs of coffee at five in the m orning, the 
disorder of his workshop, his frayed blanket, and hi s custom of sitting in the street door at dusk. But 
she had to tolerate that one loose piece in the family machinery because she was sure that the old 
colonel was an animal who had been tamed by the years and by disappointment and who, in a  burst 
of senile rebellion, was quite capable of uprootin g the foundations of the house. When her husband 
decided to g ive their first son the name of hi s great-grandfather, she did not dare oppose him 
because she had been th ere only a year. But when  the first daughter was bom she expressed her  
unreserved determinatio n to name her Renata after her mother. Úrsula had decid ed to call h er 
Remedios. After a tense argument, in which Au reliano Segundo acted as  the laughing go-between,  
they baptized her with the name Renata Remedios , but Fernanda went on calling her just Renata 
while her husband’s family and everyo ne in to wn called her Meme, a diminutive of Remedios. 
At first Fernanda did not talk about her family, but in time she began to id ealize her father. She 
spoke of him at the tabl e as an excep tional being who had renounced all forms of vanit y and was on 
his way to b ecoming a sa int. Aureliano Segundo, startl ed at that unbridled glorification of his father-
in-law, could not resist th e temptation  to make sm all jokes behind his wife’s  back. The rest of the 
family followed his example. Even Úrsula, who wa s extremely careful to preserve family harmony 
and who  suffered in secr et from th e domestic fricti on, once allowed herself  the liberty o f saying tha t 
her little great-great-gran dson had his pontifical fu ture assured because he was “the g randson of a 
saint and the son of a que en and a rustler.” In  spite of that conspiracy of smiles, the children becam e 
accustom ed to think of their grandfather as a le gendary being who wrote them pious verses in his 
letters and every Christmas sent them a box of gi fts that barely fitted through the outside door.  
Actually they were th e last remains of his lordly i nheritance. They used th em to build an al tar of life-
size saints in  the children ’s bedroom, saints with glass eyes th at gave them a disquietingly lifelike  
look, whose artistically embroidered clothing was b etter than that worn by any inhabita nt of Macon-
do. Little by little the funereal splendor of the ancient and icy mansion wa s being transformed into 
the splendor  of the House of Buendía. “They’ve  already sent us the w hole family cemetery,” 
Aureliano Segundo commented one day. “All we need no w are the weeping will ows and  the 
tombstones. ” Although nothing ever arrived in t he boxes th at the childr en could play with, they 
would spend  all year waiting for December because, after all, the antique a nd always u npredictabl e 
gifts were something, new in the h ouse. On th e tenth Chri stmas, when  little José Arcadio was  
getting ready to go to  the seminary, the enormou s box from their grandfather arrived earlier than 
usual, nailed tight and protected with  pitch, and addressed in the usual Gothic letters to the Very 
Distinguished Lady Doña  Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía. While she read the letter in h er room the 
children hastened to open the box. Aided as was customary by Aureliano Segundo, they broke the  
seals, opened the cover, took out th e protective s awdust, and found inside a long lead chest closed  
by copper bolts. Aureliano Segundo took out the eight bolts  as the children wa tched  impatiently, 
and he barel y had time to give a cry and push th e children aside when be raised the lead cover and  
saw Don F ernando, dressed in black and with a crucifix on his chest, his skin broken out in 
pestilential s ores and coo king slowly in a frothy stew with bub bles like live pearls. 
A short time after the birth of their daughter , the unexpected jubilee for Colonel A ureliano, 
Buendía, ordered by th e government to celebra te another anni versary of the Treaty of Neerlandia,  
 107GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
was announced. It was a decision s o out of line wi th official policy that the colonel spoke ou t 
violently against it and rej ected the ho mage. “It’s the first time I’ve ever hea rd of the wo rd ‘jubilee,’ 
” he said. “But whatever it means, it has to be  a trick.” The small golds mith shop was filled with 
emissaries. Much older and more so lemn, the la wyers in dar k suits who in other days had flapped 
about the co lonel like crows had returned. When he saw them appear th e same as th e other time,  
when th ey ca me to pu t a stop to the war, he coul d not bear th e cynicism  of their praise. He ordered  
them to leav e him in peace, insisting that he was not a hero of the nation as  they said but an artisan 
without memories whose only dream was to die of fatigue in the oblivion and misery of his little 
gold fishes. What made him most indignant was the word tha t the president of the republic himself 
planned to  be present at the ceremon ies in Maco ndo in order to decorate him with  the Order of  
Merit. Colonel Aureliano, Buendía had him told, word  for word, that he was eagerly awaiting that 
tardy but des erved occasi on in order to take a shot at him, not as payment f or the arbitrary acts and 
anachronism s of his regime, but for his lack of re spect for an old man who  had not don e anyone any  
harm. Such was th e veh emence with  which h e made the threat th at the president o f the republi c 
canceled his trip at the la st moment a nd sent the decoration with a persona l representati ve. Colonel 
Gerineldo Márquez, besieged by pre ssures of all kinds, left  his bed of a paralytic in order to persuade  
his former companion in arms. When the latter sa w the rockin g chair carried by four men appear  
and saw the friend who had shared his victories an d defeats since youth sitting in it among some 
large pillows, he did not have a single  doubt but that  he was making that effort in  order to express  
his solidarity. But when he discovered the real moti ve for his visit he had them take him out of the 
workshop. 
“Now I’m convinced to o late,” he told him, “that I would h ave done yo u a great fav or if I’d let 
them shoot you.” 
So the jubilee was celebra ted withou t the attendance of any m embers of the family. Chance had i t 
that it also coincided with carnival week, but no one could get the stubb orn idea out of Colonel 
Aureliano Buendía’s head that the coincidence h ad been foreseen by the government in order to  
heighten the cruelty of the mockery. From his lone ly workshop he could hear the martial music, the 
artillery salutes, the tollin g of the Te Deum, and a few phrases of the speeches delivered in front of 
the house as  they named  the street a fter him. Hi s eyes grew moist with indignation, with angr y 
impotence, a nd for the first time since his defeat i t pained him not to have th e strength of youth so  
that he coul d begin a bloody war that would wi pe out the last vestiges of the Conser vative regime. 
The echoes of the homage had not died down when Úrsula knocked at the workshop door. 
“Don’t bother me,” he said. “I’m busy .” 
“Open up,” Úrsula insist ed in a normal voice. “This has nothing to do with the celebra tion.” 
Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía too k down the ba r and saw at the door s eventeen men of the 
most varied appearance, of all types and colors, but all with a solitary air  that would have been  
enough to id entify them anywhere on  earth. Th ey were his son s. Without a ny previous agreement,  
without kno wing each other, they had  arrived from th e most distant corners of the coa st, captivated  
by the talk of the jubilee. They all bore with pr ide the name Aureliano and the last name of their  
mothers. The three da ys that th ey sta yed in the house, to the satisfaction of Úrsula and the scand al 
of Fernanda, were like a state war. Am aranta search ed among old papers for the ledger where Úrsula 
had written down the na mes and birth and baptism dates of all of them, and beside th e space for  
each one she added his pr esent addres s. That list co uld well ha ve served as a recapitulati on of twenty 
years of war. From it the nocturnal itinerary of the colonel from the dawn he left Macondo at the 
head of twenty-one men on his way to a fanciful rebellion  until he returned for t he last time 
wrapped in a blanket stiff with blood could have  been reconstr ucted. Aureliano Segundo did not let 
the chan ce go by to regale his cousins with a thun derous cham pagne and a ccordion party that wa s 
interpreted a s a tardy adj ustment of accounts with  the carnival, which went awry b ecause of th e 
 108GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
jubilee. They smashed ha lf of the dishes, they des troyed the r ose bushes a s they ch ased a bull they  
were trying to hog-tie, they killed the hens by shooting them,  they made Amaranta dance the sad 
waltzes of Pietro Crespi, they got Remedios the Be auty to pu t on a pair of men’s pants and climb a 
greased pole, and in the dining room they turned  loose a pig daubed with lard, which prostrated  
Fernanda, but no one regretted the d estruction because  the house shook with a health y earthquake.  
Colonel Aureliano Buendía who at first received th em with mistrust and even doubted th e parentag e 
of some, was amused by their wildness, and before th ey left he gave each o ne a little gold fish. Even 
the withdrawn José Arcadio Segundo offered them an afternoon of cockfights, which was at the 
point of ending in tragedy because s everal of the Au relianos were so expert i n matters of the cockpi t 
that they sp otted Fath er Antonio Isa bel’s tricks  at once. Aureliano Segundo, who saw the limitles s 
prospect of wild times offered by tho se mad relati ves, decided that th ey sho uld all stay a nd work for 
him. The only one who accepted wa s Aureliano Triste,  a big mulatto with  the drive an d explorer’s  
spirit of his grandfather. He had already tested his  fortune in half the world and it did not matter to  
him where he stayed. T he others, even though they were u nmarried, considered their destinies  
established. They were all skillful craftsmen, the men of their houses, peace-loving people. The Ash 
Wednesday before they went back to scatter out along the coast, Amar anta got them to put on 
Sunday clothes and acco mpany her to church. More amused than devout, they let them selves be led  
to the altar r ail where Fa ther Antonio  Isabel made the sign of the cross in ashes on th em. Back at 
the house, when the youngest tried to clean his fore head, he discovered that the mark was indelibl e 
and so were those of his brothers . They tried so ap and water, earth an d a scrubbing brush, and lastl y 
a pumice sto ne and lye, b ut they could not remove the crosses . On the oth er hand, Am aranta an d 
the others who had gone to mass to ok it off wi thout any tro uble. “It’s better that wa y,” Úrsula  
stated as she said goodbye to them. “From now on everyone will know who you are.” They went off  
in a troop, p receded b y a band of mu sicians and s hooting off fireworks, and they left b ehind in th e 
town an impression that the Buendía line had enough seed for many centuries. Aureliano Triste, 
with the cross of ashes on his forehead, set up on t he edge of town the ice factory that J osé Arcadio  
Buendía had dreamed of in his inventive delirium. 
Some month s after his arrival, when he was al ready well-known and well-liked, Aureliano Triste 
went abou t looking for a house so th at he could s end for his mother and an unmarried sister (who  
was not the colonel’s da ughter), and he became in terested in  the run-down big house that looked  
abandoned on a corner of the squar e. He asked w ho owned it. Someone told  him that it did not 
belong to an yone, tha t in former times a solit ary widow who fed on earth  and whitewash from the 
walls had lived there, and that in her last years she was seen only twice on  the street with a hat of 
tiny artificial flowers and shoes the col or of old si lver when she crossed the s quare to the post office 
to mail a letter to the Bishop. They told him that  her only companion was a pitiless se rvant woman  
who killed dogs and cats and any animal that got into the house and threw their corpses into th e 
middle of the street in or der to annoy people with the ro tten stench. So mu ch time had  passed since 
the sun had mummified the empty skin of the last an imal that everybody took it for granted that the  
lady of the h ouse and the maid had di ed long before the wars were over, a nd that if th e house was  
still standing it was  because in recent years there had not been a rough wi nter or destr uctive wind.  
The hinges h ad crum bled with rust, th e doors were held up only by clouds of  cobwebs, the windows  
were soldered shut by d ampness, an d the floor wa s broken by grass and  wildflowers and in th e 
cracks lizards and all manner of vermin had their nests, all of which seemed to confi rm the notion 
that there ha d not been a human being there for at least half a century. The impulsive Aureliano  
Triste did not need such proof to proceed. He pu shed on the main door with his shoulder and the 
worm-eaten wooden fra me fell down noiselessly amid  a dull cata clysm o f dust and termite nes ts. 
Aureliano Triste stood on  the threshol d waiting for the dust to clear and then  he saw in th e center of  
the room the squalid woman, still dressed in clothing  of the past century, with a few yellow threads 
 109GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
on her bald head, and wi th two larg e eyes, still beautiful, in which th e last stars of hope had gone  
out, and the skin of her face was wrinkled by the aridity of solitude. Shaken by that vision from 
another worl d, Aureliano Triste barel y noticed that  the wo man was aimin g an antiqua ted pistol at 
him. 
“I beg your pardon,” he murmured. 
She remained motionless in the center of the ro om filled with  knickknacks , examining inch by 
inch the giant with square shoulders and with a tattoo of ashes on his forehead, and through the  
haze of dust she saw him in the haze of other ti mes with a double-barreled shotgun on his shoulder 
and a string of rabbits in his hand. 
“For the love of God,” she said in a l ow voice, it ’s not right for them to come to m e with that 
memory no w.” 
“I want to rent the house, ” Aureliano Triste said. 
The woman then raised the pistol, aiming with a fi rm wrist at the cross of ashes, and she held th e 
trigger with a determinati on against which there was no appeal.  
“Get out,” she ordered. 
That night a t dinner Aur eliano Triste told the fa mily about the episode a nd Úrsula wept with  
consternation. “Holy God!” she exclaimed, clutchin g her head with her hands. “She’s still alive!” 
Time, wars, the countl ess everyday di sasters had made her fo rget about R ebeca. The o nly one who  
had not lost for a single minute the a wareness th at she was alive and rotting in her wormhole was 
the implacab le and aging Amaranta. S he thought of her at dawn, when the ice of her heart awakened  
her in her solitary bed, and she thought of her wh en she soaped her withered breasts and her lean 
stomach, an d when she put on the white stiff-starch ed petticoats and cor sets of old age, and when  
she changed the black bandage of terrible expiati on on her hand. Always, at every moment, asleep  
and awake, during the most sub lime and  most abject moments, Am aranta thought a bout Rebeca , 
because solitude had made a selection in her memory  and had burned the di mming piles of nostalgic 
waste that life had accum ulated in her  heart, and had purified, magnified and eternalized  the oth ers, 
the most bitter ones. Rem edios the B eauty knew ab out Rebeca’s existence from her. Every time they 
passed the r un-down house she would tell her about an unpleasant inciden t, a tale of hate, trying in 
that way to make her extended rancor be shared  by her niece and consequently prolonged beyond 
death, but her plan did not work because Remedios  was immune to any k ind of passionate feeling s 
and much less to those of others. Úrsula, on the other hand, who had suffered through a process 
opposite to Amaranta’s, recalled Reb eca with a memory free of im purities, for the image of the 
pitiful child brought to the house with the bag containing her parents’ bones prevailed over the 
offense that had made her unworth y to be co nnected to th e family tree any longer . Aureliano 
Segundo decided that they would have to bring her to the house and take care of her, but his good 
intentions were frustrated by the firm intransigence of Rebeca, who had  needed ma ny years of  
sufferin g and misery in order to attain the priv ileges of solitude and  who was no t disposed to 
renounce them in exchan ge for an old age dist urbed by the fals e attractions of charity. 
In February, when the si xteen sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned, still marked with the 
cross of ashes, Aureliano Triste spok e to them  about Rebeca in  the tumult of the cel ebration and in  
half a day they restored  the appeara nce of the ho use, changing doors and windows, painting the 
front with gay colors, bracing walls and pouring  fresh cement on the floor, but they co uld not get 
any authorization to continue the work inside. Rebeca did not even come to  the door. She let them  
finish the mad restoratio n, then calcu lated wha t it had cost an d sent Argén ida, her old servant who 
was still with her, to them with a handful of coins that had been withdrawn from circulation after  
the last war and that Rebeca thou ght were still worth something it was then that they saw to what a 
fantastic poi nt her separ ation from the world had arrived and they understood that i t would be 
impossible to rescue her from her stubborn enclo sure while she still had a breath of life in her. 
 110GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
On the second visit by t he sons of Colonel Au reliano Buendía to Macondo, another of them, 
Aureliano Centeno, stayed on to work with Aurelia no Triste. He was one of the first who had been 
brought to t he house for baptism and Úrsula  and Am aranta remembered h im very well because in a 
few hours he had d estroyed every breakable obj ect th at passed thro ugh his hands. Time ha d 
moderated h is early impu lse for growth and h e was a man of average hei ght marked by smallpox  
scars, but his amazing power for manual destruction remained intact. He broke so many plates, even  
without tou ching them, that Fernand a decided to  buy him a s et of pewterware before he did away 
with the last pieces of her expensive china, and ev en the resista nt metal plates were soon  dented an d 
twisted. But to make up f or that irremediable power , which was  exasperating  even for hi m, he h ad a 
cordiality th at won  the i mmediate co nfidence of others and a  stupendous  capaci ty for work. In a  
short time he had increased the production of ice to such a degree that it wa s too much for the local  
market and Aureliano Triste had to think about the possibility of expanding the business to other  
towns in the swamp. It was then that he thought of the decisive step, not only for the modernizatio n 
of his business but to link the town with the rest of  the world. 
“We have to bring in the railroad,” he s aid. 
That was the first time that the word had ever  been heard in Macondo. Looking at the sketch  
that Aurelia no Triste drew on th e table and tha t was a direct descen dent of the plans  with which  
José Arcadio  Buendía ha d illustrated his project fo r solar warfare, Úrsula confirmed her impression 
that time wa s going in a circle. But unlike his fo rebear, Aureliano Triste did not lose any sleep or 
appetite nor did he torment anyone wi th crises of ill humor, but  he considered the most harebrained 
of projects a s immediate possibilities, made rationa l calculations about costs and dates, and brought 
them off without any intermediate ex asperation. If Aureliano Segundo had something of his great-
grandfather in him and lacked something of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was an absolute 
indifference to mockery,  and he gave the mon ey to  bring the r ailroad with the sam e lighthearted  air 
with which he had given it for his brother’s absurd navigation project. Aureliano Triste consulted 
the calendar and left th e following Wednesday, pl anning to return after the rains had passed. Ther e 
was no mor e news of hi m. Aureliano  Centeno, o verwhelmed by the abun dance of th e factory, had  
already begun to experiment with the production of ice with a base of fruit juices instead of water, 
and without knowing it or thinking about it, he  conceived the essenti al fundamen tals for th e 
invention of sherbet. In that way he planned to diversify the producti on of an e nterprise he 
considered his own, because his brother showed no  signs of returning after t he rains had passed and 
a whole summer had gone by with no news of hi m. At the start of another winter, however, a 
woman who was washing clothes in th e river during the hottest time of the day ran screa ming down 
the main street in an alar ming state of commotion.  
“It’s coming,” she finally explained. “Something fr ightful, like a kitchen dr agging a village behind 
it.” 
At tha t moment the to wn was sha ken by a whistle with a  fearful echo and a loud, panting 
respiration. During the previous weeks they h ad seen the gangs who were la ying ties and  tracks an d 
no one paid attention to them because they thoug ht it was so me new trick of the gypsies, coming 
back with whistles and tambourines and their ag e-old and discredited song and dance about the 
qualities of some con coction put to gether by jo urneyman g eniuses of Jerusalem. B ut when  they 
recovered from the noise of the whistles and the s norting, all the inhabitants ran out into the street 
and saw Aur eliano Triste waving from the locomotive, and in a trance th ey saw the flower-bedecked  
train which was arriving for the first time eight months late. T he innocent yellow train that was to  
bring so many ambiguities and certa inties, so ma ny pleasant and unpleasant moments, so many 
changes, cala mities, and feelings of nostalgia to Macondo.

Chapter 12 
DAZ ZLED BY SO M ANY and such marvelous inventions, the people of Macondo did not know where 
their amazement began.  They stayed  up all night looking at the pale electric bulbs fed by the plant 
that Aurelia no Triste had brought back when th e train made its second trip, and it took time and 
effort for them to grow a ccustom ed to its obsess ive toom-toom . They be. came indignant over the 
living images that the pro sperous merchant Bruno  Crespi projected in the theater wi th the lion-hea d 
ticket windows, for the character who had died  and was buried in one film and for whose 
misfortune tears of afflic tion had been shed woul d reappear al ive and trans formed into an Arab in  
the next on e. The audien ce, who paid  two cents a piece to sh are the difficulties of the a ctors, would 
not tolerate that outlandi sh fraud and they broke up  the seats.  The mayor, at the urging of Bruno 
Crespi, expla ined in a pro clamation that the cinema  was a machine of illus ions that did not merit the  
emotional o utbursts of the audience.  With that d iscouraging explanation many felt that they had 
been th e victims of som e new and  showy gypsy business and  they decid ed not to return to th e 
movies, cons idering that they alread y had too  many troubles of their own to weep ov er the acted-out 
misfortunes of imaginary beings. Something si milar happened with the cylinder phonographs that 
the m erry m atrons from France brought with th em as a substitute for the antiquated hand organs 
and that for a time had serious effects on the liveli hood of the  band of musicians. At first curiosity 
increased th e clientele o n the forbidden street a nd there was  even word of respectable ladies who 
disguised themselves as workers in order to obs erve the novelty of the phonograph from  first hand, 
but from so much and such close observation they soon reached the concl usion that it was not an 
enchanted mill as everyone had thought and as th e matrons had said, but a mechanical trick that 
could not b e comp ared with someth ing so moving, so huma n, and so fu ll of everyda y truth as a  
band of musicians. It was such a serious disappoi ntment that when phonographs became so popular  
that there wa s one in every house they were not co nsidered objects for amusement for adults but as 
something good for children to take apart. On the other hand, when someone from the town had  
the opportu nity to test the crude reality of the tele phone installed in the railroad station, which was 
thought to be a rudimentary version of the phonograph because of its crank, even the most 
incredulous were upset.  It was as if God had d ecided to put to th e test every cap acity for surprise 
and was  keeping the inh abitants of Macondo in  a permanen t alterna tion between  excitemen t and 
disappointment, doubt and revelation, to such an extreme that no one k new for certain where the 
limits of reality lay. It was an intricate stew of truths and mira ges that con vulsed the g host of José 
Arcadio Buendía under the ches tnut tree with  impatience and  made him  wander all through the 
house even i n broad dayl ight. Ever since the railr oad had been officially inaugurated and had begun 
to arrive with regularity on Wednesd ays at eleven  o’clock and  the primitive wooden  station with  a 
desk, a telep hone, and a ticket windo w had been built, on the streets of Macondo men  and women  
were seen  who had adop ted everyda y and normal  customs an d manners b ut who reall y looked like 
people out o f a circus. In a town  that had chafed under the tricks of the gyp sies there wa s no future 
for those am bulatory acr obats of co mmerce who  with equal effrontery offered a whistl ing kettle an d 
a daily regime that would assure the sal vation of th e soul on the seventh day; but from those who let 
themselves be convinced out of fatigue and the ones wh o were alwa ys unwary, they reaped  
stupendous benefits. Am ong those th eatrical crea tures, wearing riding breeches and leg gings, a pith 
helmet a nd steel-rimmed glasses, with topaz eyes  and the skin of a thin rooster, there arrived in  
Macondo on one of so  many Wednesdays the ch ubby and smiling Mr. Herbert, who ate at the 
house. 
 112GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
No one had noticed him at the table until the first bunch of bananas had been eaten. Aureliano 
Segundo had come across him by chance as he pr otested In br oken Spanish because th ere were n o 
rooms at the Hotel Jacob, and as he frequently did with strangers, he took him home. He was in the 
captive-balloon business, which had taken him halfwa y around the world wi th excellent profits, but 
he had not succeeded in  taking anyone up in Macondo beca use they co nsidered tha t invention  
backward after having seen and tried  the gypsies’  flying carpets. He was l eaving, therefore, on th e 
next train. When they brought to the table th e tiger-striped bunch of bananas that they wer e 
accustom ed to hang in the dining room during lunc h, he picked the first piece of fruit without grea t 
enthusiasm. But he kep t on eating as he spoke, tas ting, chewin g, more with  the distra ction of a wise 
man than wi th the delight of a good eater, and when  he finished the first bunch he as ked them to  
bring him a nother. Then he took a small case with optical instruments out of the toolbox that he 
always carried with him. With the a uspicious attention of a diamond merchant he ex amined th e 
banana meti culously, dissecting it with  a special sc alpel, weighing the pieces on a ph arma cist’s scale,  
and calculati ng its breadth with a gunsmith’s caliper s. Then he took a serie s of instrum ents out of 
the ch est wi th which he measured th e temp erature, the level  of humidity in the a tmosp here, and th e 
intensity of the light. It was such an in triguing cerem ony that n o one could eat in pea ce as everybody 
waited for Mr. Herbert to pass a final and revea ling judgme nt, but he d id not say anything that 
allowed anyo ne to guess his intentions. 
On the days  that followed he was seen with a net and a small basket hunting butterflies on the 
outskirts of town. On Wednesday a group of en gineers, agronomists, hydrologists, t opographers, 
and surveyors arrived who for several weeks explored  the places where Mr. Herbert had hunted his  
butterflies. Later on Mr. Jack Brown a rrived in an extra coach that had been  coupled onto the yellow 
train and that was silver-plated all over, with seats of  episcopal velvet, and a r oof of blue glass. Also 
arriving on the special ca r, fluttering around Mr.  Brown, were the solemn lawyers dres sed in black  
who in different times  had followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía  everywhere,  and tha t led the peopl e 
to think that the agronomists, hydrologists, topog raphers, and surveyors, like Mr. Herbert with hi s 
captive balloons and his colored butterflies and Mr. Brown with his mau soleum on wheels and hi s 
ferocious German shepherd dogs, had something to do with th e war. There was not mu ch time to  
think about it, however, because the suspicious in habitants of Macondo barely began to wonder 
what the d evil was going on when  the town  had al ready becom e transformed into an  encampmen t 
of wooden houses with zinc roofs inhabited by fo reigners wh o arrived on  the train from halfwa y 
around the world, riding not only on the seats an d platforms but even on the roof of the coach es. 
The gringos, who la ter on brought th eir languid wive s in muslin dresses and large veiled hats, built a 
separate town across the railroad tracks with streets  lined with palm trees, houses with screened win-
dows, small white tables on the terraces, and fans mounted on the ceilings, and extensiv e blue lawns 
with peacocks and quails. The secti on was surrounded by a metal fence topped with a band of  
electrified chicken wire which during the cool summer mornings would be black with roasted  
swallows. No one knew yet what they were after, or whether they were actually nothing but 
philanthropists, and they had already caused a colossa l disturbance, much more than that of the ol d 
gypsies, but less transitory and understandable. Endowed with means tha t had been reserved for 
Divine Providence in  former times, they ch anged  the pattern of the rams,  accelerated  the cycle of 
harvest, and moved the river from where it had always been a nd put it with its white stones and icy 
currents on the other side of the town, behind the cemetery. It was at tha t time that they built a  
fortress of reinforced concrete over the faded tomb of José Arcadio, so that the cor pses smell of 
powder would not contaminate th e waters. For th e foreigners who arrived without love they 
converted the street of the loving matrons from France into a more extensive village  than it had 
been, and on one glorious Wednesday they brou ght in  a trainload of strange whores, Babylonish 
women skilled in age-old methods and in possessi on of all manner of unguents and devices to 
 113GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
stimulate the unaroused, to give courage to the ti mid, to satia te the voraci ous, to exalt the modes t 
man, to teach a lesson to  repeaters, a nd to correct  solitary peo ple. The Street of the Tur ks, enriched 
by well-lit stores with products from abroad, disp lacing the old bazaars with their bright colors, 
overflowed on Saturday nights with the crowds of  adventurers who bumped into each other among 
gambling tables, shooting galleries, the alley wher e the future was guessed and dreams interpreted , 
and tables o f fried food and drinks, and on Sund ay mornings there were scattered o n the ground 
bodies that were someti mes those of  happy drunka rds and more often those of onlookers felled by 
shots, fists, knives, and b ottles during the braw ls. It was such a tumultuous a nd intemper ate invasion  
that during the first days it was impos sible to walk through the streets beca use of the furniture and 
trunks, and the noise of the carpentry of those who were building their houses in any vacant lot 
without asking anyone’s permission, and the sc andalous behavior of c ouples who hung their  
hammocks b etween the al mond trees a nd made love un der the netting in broad daylight and in view 
of everyone. The only serene corner had been  established by peaceful West Indian Negroes, who 
built a marginal street with wooden houses on piles where they would sit in the doors at dusk 
singing melancholy hymns in their d isordered gabbl e. So many changes took  place in such a shor t 
time that eig ht months after Mr. Herbert’s visit th e old inhabitants had a hard time recognizing their 
own town. 
“Look at the mess we’ve got ourselves into,” Colon el Aureliano Buendía said at that time, “just 
because we invited a gringo to eat so me bananas. ” 
Aureliano Segundo, on t he other hand, could not contain his happiness over the avalanche of  
foreigners. The house was suddenly filled with unknown guests, with invincible and worldly 
carousers, and it became necessary to add bedroom s off the courtyard, widen the dining room, and 
exchange th e old table for one that held sixteen people, with  new china a nd silver, and even then 
they had to eat lunch in shifts. Fernanda had to swallow her scruples and their guests of the worst 
sort like kings as they m uddied the porch with thei r boots, urinated in the garden. laid their mats  
down anywh ere to take their siesta, and spoke withou t regard for the sens itivities of la dies or the  
proper behavior of gentlemen. Amar anta, was so scandalized  with the plebeian invasi on that she 
went b ack to  eating in th e kitchen as in olde n days. Colonel Aureliano Buendía, convinced that th e 
majority of those who  came into his workshop to  greet him were not doing it becaus e of sympathy 
or regard but out of the curiosity to meet a histor ical relic, a museum fossil, decided to shut himself 
in by barring the door an d he was not seen any m ore except o n very rare occasions when he woul d 
sit at the street door. Úrsula, on the o ther hand, even  during th e days  when  she was  alrea dy dragging 
her feet and  walking ab out groping along the walls, fe lt a ju venile excitement as th e time for the 
arrival of the train approached. “We have to prepare some meat and fish,” she would order the four 
cooks, who hastened to have everyth ing ready unde r the imperturbable direction of Sa nta Sofía de l a 
Piedad. “We have to prep are everythin g,” she insi sted, “because we never know  what these strangers 
like to eat.” The train arrived during the hottest ti me of day. At lunchtime the house sh ook with the 
bustle of a marketplace,  and the pers piring guests—who did n ot even kno w who th eir hosts were—
trooped in to occupy the best places at the tabl e, while the cooks bumped into each other with 
enormous kettles of soup, pots of meat, large gourds  filled with vegetables, and troughs of rice, and 
passed aroun d the con tents of barrels of lemonade with inexha ustible ladles. The disorder was such 
that Fernand a was troubl ed by th e idea that many  were ea ting twice and o n more than o ne occasion  
she was abo ut to burst out with a vegetable ha wker’s insults because someone a t the table in  
confusion asked her for the check. M ore than a year  had gone by since Mr . Herbert’s visit and the 
only thing that was known was that th e gringos were planning to plant banana trees in the enchanted  
region that José Arcadio Buendía and his men had crossed in search of the route to the great 
inventions. Two other sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, with the cross of ashes on their 
 114GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
foreheads, arrived, drawn by that grea t volcanic belch, and they justified their determination with a  
phrase that may have ex plained everybody’s reasons. 
“We came,” they said, “because everyone is comin g.” 
Remedios the Beauty was  the only one who was immune to the banana plague. She was becalmed  
in a magnificent adolescence, more and more impen etrable to formality, more and more indifferent 
to malice and suspicion, happy in her  own world of  simple realities. She did not understand why 
women co mplicated th eir lives with co rsets and petticoats, so sh e sewed h erself a coarse cassock that 
she simply put over her and without further diffi culties resolved the problem of dress, without 
taking away the feeling of being naked , which a ccording to her lights was th e only d ecent way to be 
when at home. They bothered her so much to cut the rain of hair that already reached to her thighs 
and to make rolls with combs and braids with red ribbons that s he simply shaved her head and used 
the hair to make wigs for the saints. The startlin g thing about her simplifying instinct was that t he 
more she did away with fashion in a search for comfort and the more she passed over conventions  
as she obeyed spontaneity, the mor e disturbing  her incredible beauty became and  the mor e 
provocative she became to men. When the sons  of Colonel Aur eliano Buend ía were in M acondo for 
the first time, Úrsula remembered that in thei r veins they bore the same blood as her great-
granddaughter and she s huddered with a forgotten fright. “Keep your eyes  wide open,” she warned  
her. “With any of them your children will come out with the tail of a pig.” The girl paid  such little 
attention to the warning that she dressed up as a man and rolled around in the sand in order to  
climb the greased pole, and she was  at the point  of bringing on a trage dy among the seventeen 
cousins, who were driven mad by the unbearable specta cle. That was why n one of them slept at th e 
house when they visited the town  and the four w ho had stayed lived in rented rooms at Úrsula’s  
insistence. R emedios the Beauty, however, would ha ve died laughing if she had known about that 
precaution. Until her last  moment on earth she was unaware that her irreparable fate as a disturbing 
woman was a daily disaster. Every time she appeared  in the dining room, a gainst Úrsula’s orders, she  
caused a p anic of exasperation among  the outsider s. It was all too evident that she was completely 
naked underneath her crude nightshirt and no one could understand tha t her shaved and perfect 
skull was not some kind of challenge, and that the boldness with which she uncovered her thighs to 
cool off was not a criminal provocation, nor wa s her pleasure when she sucked her fingers after. 
eating. What no member  of the family ever knew was that the strangers did not take lon g to realize 
that Remedi os the Beauty gave off a breath of perturbation, a tormenting breeze that was still  
perceptible several hours after she had passed by . Men expert in the disturbances of love, 
experienced all over the world, stated that they  had never suffered an anxiety similar to the one 
produced by the natural smell of Remedios the Beauty. On the porch with the bego nias, in the 
parlor, in any place in th e house, it was possible to  point out the exact place where she had been an d 
the time that had passed since she had left it. It wa s a definite, unmistakable trace that n o one in the 
family could distinguish b ecause it had been incorpor ated into the daily odo rs for a long time, but it 
was one th at the outsi ders identified immediat ely. They were the onl y ones, ther efore, who 
understood how th e you ng com mander of the guard had died of love and how a gentleman from a 
faraway land  had been pl unged into desperation. Un aware of the restless circle in which she moved , 
of the unbearable state of inti mate calamity that she provoked as she p assed by, Remedios th e 
Beauty treated the m en without the least bit of ma lice and in the end upset them with h er innocen t 
complaisance. When Úrsula succeeded in imposing the command that she eat with Ama ranta in the 
kitchen so th at the ou tsiders would not see her, she felt more co mfortable, because, after all, she was  
beyond all discipline. In reality, it made no differe nce to  her wh ere she ate,  and not at reg ular hours 
but according to the whims of her appetite. Someti mes she would get up to have lunch at three in  
the morning, sleep all da y long, and she spent several months wi th her tim etable all in disarray unti l 
some casual incident wou ld bring her back into the order of things. When things were going better  
 115GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
she would g et up at elev en o’clock in  the morning and shut herself up until two  o’clock, completely 
nude, in the bathroom, killing scorpions as she came out of her dense and prolonged  sleep. Then 
she would throw water from the cistern over hersel f with a gourd. It was an act so prolonged, so  
meticulous, so rich in ceremonial aspects that one who did not know her w ell would have thought  
that she was  given over to the deserv ed adoratio n of her own body. For her, however, that solitary 
rite lacked al l sensuality a nd was simp ly a way of p assing the time until she was hungry. One day, as  
she began to bathe herself, a stranger lifted a tile  from the roof and was breathless at the tremendous  
spectacl e of her nudity. She saw his d esolate eyes through the broken tiles and had no reaction of 
shame but ra ther one of a larm. 
“Be careful,” she exclaim ed. “You’ll fall.” 
“I just wanted to see you, ” the foreigner murmured. 
“Oh, all right,” she said. “But be careful, those tiles are rotten.” 
The stranger’s face had a pained ex pression of st upor and he seemed  to be battling silently 
against his primary instincts so as not to break up  the mirage. Remedios th e Beauty tho ught that h e 
was sufferin g from the fear that the tiles would br eak and she bathed herself more quickly than usual 
so that the man would not be in danger. While she was pouring water from the, cistern she told him 
that the roof was in that state because she thought that the bed of leaves had been rotted by the rain  
and that was what was filling the bathroom with sc orpions. The stranger thought that her small talk  
was a way of covering her complaisance, so th at when she began to soap herself he gave into 
tempta tion a nd went a step further. 
“Let me soap you,” he murmured. 
“Thank you for your good intentions,” she said, “but my two hands are quite enough.” 
“Even if it’s just your ba ck,” the foreigner begged. 
“That would be silly,” she said. “People never soap their backs.” 
Then, while she was drying herself, the stranger begged her, with his eyes  full of tears, to marry 
him. She answered him sincerely that she would never marry a man who was so simple that he ha d 
wasted almo st an hour an d even wen t without lunch just to see a woman tak ing a bath. Finally, when 
she put on her cassock, the man could not bear the proof that, indeed, she was not wear ing anything 
underneath, as everyone had suspected, and he felt  himself marked forever with the white-hot iron 
of that secret. Then he to ok two more tiles off in order to drop down into th e bathroom.  
“It’s very high,” she warned him in fright. “You’ll kill yourself!” 
The rotten tiles broke with a noise of disaster an d the man barely had time to let out a cry of 
terror as he cracked his skull and was killed outrig ht on the cement floor. The foreigne rs who heard 
the noise in the dining room and hastened to remove the body noticed the suffocating odor of 
Remedios th e Beauty on his skin. It was so deep in his body that the cracks in his skull did not give 
off blood but an amber -colored oil that was impreg nated wi th tha t secret perfume, a nd then they 
understood that the sm ell of Remedios the Beauty  kept on torturing men beyond death, right down 
to the dust of their bon es. Nevertheless, they did not rela te that horrible accident to  the other  two 
men who had died because of Remedios the Beauty. A victim was still needed before the outsider s 
and many of the old inhabitants of Macondo would credit the legend that Remedi os Buendía did not 
give off a  breath of love but a fatal emanation. The occasion for the proof of it came some months 
later on one afternoon when Remedios the Beauty went with a group of girl friends to look at the 
new plantin gs. For the girls of Macondo that n ovel game was reason f or laughter and surprises,  
frights and jokes, and at night they would talk about their wal k as if it had been an exp erience in a 
dream. Such was the prestige of that silence that Úrsula did not have the heart to take the fun awa y 
from Remedios the Beau ty, and she let her go one  afternoon, providing that she wore a hat and a 
decent dress.  As soon as the group of friends wen t into the plantings the air became impregnated  
with a fatal fragrance. The men wh o were wor king along t he rows felt possessed by a strange  
 116GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
fascination, menaced  by some invisible danger, an d many succumbed to a  terrible desire to weep.  
Remedios th e Beauty and  her startled  friends manage d to take refuge in a nearby house just as they 
were abou t to be assaulted by a  pack of ferocious males. A sho rt time l ater they were rescued by the  
flour Aurelianos, whose crosses of ash inspired a sacred  respect, as if they were caste m arks, stamps 
of invulnerability. Remedios the Bea uty did not tell an yone that one of the me n, taking advantage of  
the tumult, had managed to attack her  stomach with a hand that was more like the claw of an eagle 
clinging to the edge of a precipice. She faced the attacker in a kind of instantaneous flash and saw 
the dis consolate eyes, which remained  stamped o n her heart like the hot coal s of pity. Th at night th e 
man boasted  of his audacity and swa ggered over his good luck on the Street of the Turks a few 
minutes bef ore the kick of a horse crushed his ch est and a  crowd of outsiders saw him die in the 
middle of the street, dro wned in his own bloody vomiting. 
The supposition that R emedios the Beauty Poss essed power s of death was then borne out by 
four irrefutable events. Although some men wh o were easy with their words said that it was worth 
sacrificing one’s life for a night of love with suc h an arousing woman, the truth was that no one 
made any ef fort to do so. Perhaps, not only to atta in her but also to conjure away her dangers, all 
that was needed was a feeling as primitive and as simple as that of love, but that was the only thing 
that did not occur to anyone. Úrsula did not worry  about her any more. On another occasion, when 
she had no t yet given up the idea  of saving her for the world, she had tried to get h er interested  in 
basic domes tic affairs. “Men deman d much more than you think,” she would tell her enigmatically. 
“There’s a lot of cooking, a lot of sweeping, a l ot of suffering over little things beyo nd what you  
think.” She was deceiving herself within, trying to  train her for domestic happiness because she was  
convinced that once his passion was  satisfied them  would no t be a m an on the face of the earth  
capable of to lerating even for a day a negligence th at was beyond all understanding. The birth of the 
latest José Arcadio and her unshakable will to brin g him up to be Pope finally caused her to cease 
worrying about her great-granddaughter. She aban done d her to  her fate, trusting that so oner or later 
a miracle would take place and that in this worl d of everything there would also be a man with 
enough sloth to put up w ith her. For a long time already Amaranta had given up trying to make her 
into a useful woman. Since those forgotten afterno ons when  her niece b arely had enough interest to  
turn the cra nk on the sewing machine, she had re ached th e conclusion that she was sim pleminded . 
“Were going to have to r affle you off,” she would tell her, per plexed at th e fact th at men’s words  
would not penetrate h er. Later on, when Úrsula insi sted that Remedios th e Beauty go to mass with  
her face covered with a s hawl, Amara nta thought that a mysterious recourse like that wo uld turn out 
to be so provoking that soon a man would come who would be intrigued enough to search ou t 
patiently for the weak poi nt of her heart. But wh en she sa w the stupid way in which sh e rejected a  
pretender who for many reasons was  more desira ble than a pr ince, she gav e up all hop e. Fernanda  
did not even  make any attempt to un derstand he r. When she s aw Remedio s the Beau ty dressed as a  
queen at the bloody carn ival she thou ght that sh e was an extra ordinary creature. But when she sa w 
her eating with her hand s, incapable of giving an answer th at was not a miracle of simplemind-
edness, the only thing that she lamen ted was the fact that the idiots in the  family lived  so long. In  
spite of the fact tha t Colo nel Aureliano Buendía ke pt on believ ing and repeating that Remedios the 
Beauty was i n reality the most lucid being that he had ever known and tha t she showed it at every 
moment with her startli ng ability to  put things over on everyone, they l et her  go her own way.  
Remedios th e Beauty sta yed there wan dering throu gh the desert of solitude, bearing no cross on her 
back, maturing in her dreams withou t nightmares , her interminable baths, her unscheduled meals, 
her deep and  prolonged silences that had no memory until one afternoon in March, when Fernand a 
wanted  to fold her braba nt sheets in  the garden an d asked the women in  the house for help. She ha d 
just begun when Amara nta noticed that Remedi os the Beauty was covered all over by an intens e 
paleness. 
 117GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“Don’t you feel well?” she asked her. 
Remedios th e Beauty, wh o was clutchi ng the sheet by the oth er end, gave a pitying smile. 
“Quite the o pposite,” she said, “I neve r felt better.” 
She had just finished saying it when Fernanda fe lt a delica te wind of light pull the sheets out o f 
her hands and open them up wide. Amaranta felt a mysterious trembling in the lace on her  
petticoa ts and she tried to grasp the sheet so th at she would not fall down at the ins tant in which  
Remedios th e Beauty beg an to rise. Úrsula, almost blind at the time, was the only person who was  
sufficiently calm to identi fy the nature of that d etermined wind and she left the sheets to the mercy 
of the light as she watched Remedios the Beauty waving good-bye in the midst of the flapping  
sheets th at rose up with  her, aband oning with  her the environment of beetles a nd dahlias and  
passing through the air with her as four o’clock in  the afterno on came to a n end, and they were los t 
forever with her in the up per atmosph ere where n ot even th e highest-flying  birds of m emory could  
reach her. 
The outsiders, of course, thought that Rem edios the B eauty had  finally succumb ed to her 
irrevocable fate of a queen bee and that her family was trying to save her honor with that tale of  
levitation. Fernanda, burning with envy, finally accep ted the mi racle, and for a long time she kept on 
praying to God to s end her back  her sheets. Most  people believed in the miracle and they ev en 
lighted candles and celeb rated noven as. Perhaps ther e might have been ta lk of nothing else for a  
long time if t he barbarous exterminati on of the Aurelianos had not replaced amazement with honor.  
Although he had never thought of  it as an omen, Colonel Aur eliano Buend ía had foreseen the tragic 
end of his sons in a certain way. When Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Arcaya, the two who  
arrived durin g the tumult,  expressed a wish to stay  in Macondo, their father tried to dissuade them.  
He could no t understand  what they were going to do in a to wn that had been transfo rmed into a  
dangerous place overnight. But Aureliano Cente no and Aureliano Triste, backed by Aureliano 
Segundo. gave them  work in their bu sinesses. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had reasons that were stil l 
very confused and were a gainst that d etermination . When he sa w Mr. Brown in the first automobil e 
to reach Macondo—an orange convertible with a hor n that frightened dogs with its bark—the old 
soldier grew indignant with the servile excitement of the people and he realized that something had  
changed in the makeup of the men s ince the d ays when th ey would leave their wives a nd children 
and toss a s hotgun on their shoulders to go off to wa r. The local authorities, after the armistice o f 
Neerlandia, were mayors without initiative, decorati ve judges picked from among the peaceful and 
tired Conservatives of Macon do. “This is a regime of wretches,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía woul d 
comment when he s aw the barefoot policemen ar med with  wooden clubs p ass. “We fought all thos e 
wars and all of it just so that  we didn’t have to paint our hous es blue.” When the banana compan y 
arrived, however, the local functionaries were repl aced by dictatorial foreigners whom Mr. Brow n 
brought to live in the el ectrified chicken yard so th at they could  enjoy, as he explained it, the dignity 
that their sta tus warranted and so that they would  not suffer from the heat and the mos quitoes and 
the countles s discomforts and privations of the town. The old policemen were replaced by hired  
assassins with machetes. Shut up in his work shop, Colonel Au reliano Buendía thought about those 
changes and  for the first time in his qu iet years of  solitude he was tormented  by the d efinite certainty 
that it had been a mistake not to have continued the war to its final conclusion. During that time a  
brother of the forgotten Colonel Magnífico Visbal was taking his seven-yea r-old grandson to get a  
soft drink at one of the pushcarts on the square and because the child accidentally bumped into a 
corporal of police and spilled the dr ink on his unif orm, the barbarian cut hi m to pieces with his 
machete, an d with one stroke he cut off the head of the grandfather as he tried to stop him. The 
whole town saw the deca pitated man pass by as a group of m en carried him to his house, with a 
woman dragging the head along by its hair, and the bloody sack with the pi eces of the child. 
 118GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
For Colonel Aureliano Buendía it meant the li mits of atonement. He s uddenly found himself 
sufferin g from the same indignation that he had felt in his you th over the body of the woman wh o 
had been  beaten to death becaus e she had b een bitten b y a rabid dog. He looked a t the groups of  
bystanders i n front of the house and with his old s tentorian voice, restored by a deep disgust with  
himself, he unloaded upon them the burden of ha te that he cou ld no longer bear in his heart. 
“One of these days,” he shouted, I’m going to arm my boys so we can get rid of these shitty 
gringos !” 
During the course of th at week , at different places along th e coast, his seventeen  sons were 
hunted down like rabbits by invisible criminals w ho aimed at the center  of their crosses of ash. 
Aureliano Triste was leav ing the house with his mother at sev en in the ev ening when a rifle shot 
came out of the darkness and perforated his forehead. Aureliano Centeno was found in the 
hammock th at he was accustomed to  hang up in  the factory with an icepick between his eyebrows  
driven in up to the handle. Aureliano Serrador had le ft his girl friend at her parents’ house after  
having taken her to  the movies and was returnin g through the well-lighted Street of the Turks wh en 
someone in the crowd wh o was never identified fire d a revolver shot which knocked him over into a 
caldron of boiling lard. A few minutes later some one knocked at the door of the r oom where 
Aureliano Arcaya was shut up with a woman and s houted to him: “Hurry  up, they’re killing your 
brothers.” The woman who was  with him said l ater that Aureliano Arcaya jumped ou t of bed and 
opened the door and was greeted with the discha rge of a Mauser that split his head open. On that  
night of death, while the house was preparing to hold a wak e for the fo ur corpses, Fernanda ran 
through the town like a madwoman l ooking for Au reliano Segundo, whom Petra Cotes had locked  
up in a closet, thinking that the ord er of exterm ination inclu ded all who  bore the col onel’s name.  
She would not let him o ut until the fourth day, wh en the telegrams received from different places  
along the coast made it clear that the fury of th e invisible enemy was directed only at the brothers  
marked with the crosses of ash. Amaranta fetched  the ledger where she had written down the facts 
about her nephews and  as the telegra ms arrived sh e drew lines through th e nam es unti l only tha t of 
the eldest remained. They remem bered him very we ll because of the contr ast between his dark skin 
and his green eyes. His name was Aureliano Amador  and he was a carpenter, living in a village 
hidden in the foothills. After waiting two weeks for the telegram telling of his deat h, Aureliano 
Segundo sent a messenger to him in order to warn him, thinking that he mi ght not know about the 
threat tha t hung over him. The emissary returned with the n ews that Au reliano Ama dor was safe. 
The night of the extermi nation two men had gone to get hi m at his hou se and had s hot at him with 
their revolvers but they h ad missed th e cross of as hes. Aureliano Amador had been able to leap over  
the wall of the courtyard  and was lost in the labyrinth of the mountains, which he knew like the back 
of his hand t hanks to the friendship he maintain ed with the Indians, from whom he bought wood. 
Nothing more was heard of him. 
Those were dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendía . The president of th e republic sent him a  
telegram of condolence i n which he promised an exhaustive investigation and paid homage to the 
dead men. At his comma nd, the mayo r appeared at th e services with four funeral wreath s, which he 
tried to place on the coffins, but the colonel ordered him into  the street. After the burial he drew u p 
and personal ly submitted  to the presi dent of the r epublic a violent telegram , which the telegrapher 
refused to send. Then he enriched it with terms of singular aggressiveness, pu t it in an envelope, and 
mailed it. As had happened with the death of his wi fe, as had ha ppened to hi m so many ti mes during 
the war with  the deaths of his best friends, he  did not have a feeling of sorrow but a blind and 
directionless rage, a broad feeling of impotence. He even accused Father Antoni o Isabel of 
complicity for having marked his sons with indelible ashes so that they-could be identified by their  
enemies. Th e decrepit pr iest, who co uld no longer string ideas together an d who was b eginning to 
startle his parishioners with the wild interpretation s he gave from the pulpit, appeared one afternoon 
 119GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
at the house with the go blet in whi ch he h ad prepared th e ashes tha t Wednesday an d he tried  to 
anoint the whole family with them to  show that they could be washed off with water. But the horror 
of the misfortune had pen etrated so d eeply that not even Fernanda would let him experiment on her  
and never again was a Bu endía seen to  kneel at the altar rail on Ash Wednes day. 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not recover his calm for a long time. He abandoned the 
manufacture of little fishes, ate with great difficulty, and wandered all through the house as if 
walking in his sleep, dragging his blanket and chew ing on his quiet rage. At the end of three month s 
his hair was ashen, his ol d waxed mu stache poured down besi de his colorless lips, but, on the o ther 
hand, his eyes were on ce more the burning coals th at had s tartled those w ho had seen him born and  
that in other  days had m ade chairs rock with a s imple glance. In the fury of his torment he tried  
futilely to r ouse the o mens th at had guided h is youth along dangerous paths  into the desolate 
wasteland  of glory. He was lost, astra y in a strange house where nothing and no one now stirred in  
him the slightest vestige o f affection. Once he op ened Melquíades’ room, looking for the traces of a 
past from before the war, and he found only rubble, trash, piles of waste accumulated  over all the 
years of abandonment. Between the covers of the book s that no one had ever read again, in the old 
parchments damaged by dampness, a livid flower had prosper ed, and in the air tha t had been  the 
purest and  brightest in th e house an u nbearable smell of rotten memories  floated. One morning he 
found Úrsula weeping u nder the ch estnut tree at th e knees of her dead hus band. Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía was the only inhabitant of the house wh o still did not see the powerful old man who had 
been bea ten down by hal f a century i n the open a ir. “Say hello to your fath er,” Úrsula told him. H e 
stopped for an instant in front of the chestnut tree and once again he saw that the empty space 
before him did not arouse an affection either. 
“What does he say?” he asked. 
“He’s very sad,” Úrsula answered, “because he think s that you’re going to die.” 
“Tell him,” the colonel said, smiling, “that a pe rson doesn’t die when he should but when he 
can.” 
The omen of  the, dead father stirred up the last re mnant of pride that was l eft in his heart, but he 
confused it with a sudden gust of strength. It was for that reason that he hounded Úrsula to tell him 
where in the courtyard the gold coins that they  had found inside the plaster Saint Joseph were 
buried. “You’ll never know,” she told him with a fi rmness inspired by an old lesson. “O ne day,” she 
added, “the owner of that fortune wil l appear an d only he can dig it up.” No one knew why a ma n 
who had always been so generous had begun to covet money with such anxiety, and not the modest  
amounts tha t would have been enough  to resolve a n emergency, but a fortune of such mad size th at 
the mere mention of it left Aureliano Segundo aw ash in am azement. His ol d fellow party memb ers, 
to whom  he went asking for help, hid so as not to  receive him.  It was around  that time that h e was 
heard to say.  “The only difference today between Li berals and Conservatives is that th e Liberals go 
to mass at five o’clock and the C onservatives at  eight.” Nevertheless  he insisted with such  
perseverance, begged in such a way, b roke his code of  dignity to such a d egree, that with  a little h elp 
from here and a little more from there, sneaking  about everywhere, with a slippery diligence and a  
pitiless perseverance, he managed to put together  in eight months more money than  Úrsula had 
buried. Then he visited the ailing Colonel Gerineld o Márquez so that he would help him start the 
total war. 
At a certain time Colonel Gerineldo Márquez wa s really the only one who could have pulled, 
even from hi s paralytics  chair, the mus ty strings of  rebellion. After the armis tice of N eerlandia, while 
Colonel Aur eliano Buendía took refuge with his  little gold fishes, he kep t in touch with the rebel  
officers who had been fa ithful to him until th e defeat. With  them  he wa ged the sad  war of daily 
humiliation, of entreaties and petitions, of co me-back-tomorrow, of any-time-now, of we’re-
studying-your-case-with-the-proper-attention; the war hopelessly lost against the many yours-most-
 120GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
trulys who should have signed and would never sign the lifetime pensio ns. The other war, th e 
bloody one of twenty years, did not cause them as  much da mage as the corrosive war of eternal  
postponements. Even Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, w ho escaped three attempts on his life, survived 
five wounds, and emerged unscathed from innumerabl e battles,  succumbed to that atroci ous siege of 
waiting and sank into th e miserable defeat of ol d age, thinking of Amaranta among the diamond-
shaped patches of light in a bor rowed house. The la st veterans  of whom he had word had appeared  
photographed in a newspaper with their faces sha melessly raised beside an anonymous president of  
the republic who gave them buttons with his likeness on them to wear in their lapels and returned to 
them a flag soiled with blood and gunpowder so that they coul d place it on their coffins. The others, 
more honorable. were still waiting for a letter in the shadow of public charity,  dying of hunger, livin g 
through rage, ratting of old age amid the exquisi te shit of glory. So that when Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía invited him to s tart a mortal  conflagration that would  wipe ou t all vestiges of a regime of 
corruption and scandal backed by the foreign inva der, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez could not hold 
back a shudder of compassion. 
“Oh, Aureliano,” he sighed. “I already knew tha t you were old , but now I realize th at yo u’re a lot 
older than you look.”

Chapter 13 
IN TH E BEWILDERME NT of her last years, Úrsula had had very little free time to attend  to the papal  
education of  José Arcadi o, and the ti me cam e for him to get ready to leav e for the seminary right 
away. Mem e, his sister, dividing her time between  Fernanda’s rigidity and Amaranta’s bitterness, at 
almost the s ame moment reached the age set for her to be sent to the nuns’ school, where they 
would make a virtuoso on the clavich ord of her. Úrsula felt tormented by grave doubts concerning 
the effectiveness of the methods with which she ha d molded the spirit of the languid apprentice 
Supreme Pontiff, but she did not put the blame on he r staggering old age or the dark clouds that 
barely permi tted h er to make out th e shape of things, but on something  that she h erself could n ot 
really define and that sh e conceived  confusedly as a progressive breakdown of time. “The years 
nowadays do n’t pass the way th e old ones used to ,” she would say, feeling that everyd ay reality wa s 
slipping through her hands. In the past, she though t, children took a long time to grow up. All one  
had to  do wa s remember  all the time n eeded for Jo sé Arcadio, the elder, to  go awa y with  the gypsies 
and all that happened before he came back painted like a snake and talking like an astronomer, and  
the things that happened in the house before Am aranta a nd Arca dio forgot the language of th e 
Indians and learned Span ish. One had  to see onl y the days of s un and d ew that po or José Arcad io 
Buendía wen t through under the ches tnut tree an d all the tim e weeded to  mourn his death before 
they brought in a dying Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who after so much war and so much suffering  
from it was still not fifty years of age . In other times, after sp ending the whole day making candy 
animals, she had more th an enough ti me for the ch ildren, to see from the whites of th eir eyes tha t 
they need ed a dose of castor oil. Now, however, when she had nothing to do and would go about 
with José Arcadio riding on her hip from dawn to d usk, this bad kind of time compelled her to leave 
things half d one. The truth was that Úrsula resist ed growing old even when she had already los t 
count of her age and she was a bother on all sides as she tried to meddle in everything and as she 
annoyed stra ngers with her questions as to whether they had left a plaster Saint Joseph to be kept 
until the rains were over during the days of the war. No one knew exactly when she had begun to 
lose her sight. Even in h er later years , when sh e could no longer get out of bed, it s eemed that she 
was simply defeated by decrepitud e, but no on e discovered that sh e was blind. She had noticed it 
before the birth of José Arcadio. At first she th ought it was a matter of a passing debility and she 
secretly took  marrow syrup and put honey on her eyes, but quite soon she began to realize that she 
was irrevoca bly sinking into the darkness, to a  point where s he never ha d a clear no tion of the 
invention of the electric light, for when they put in the first bulbs she was o nly able to p erceive th e 
glow. She did not tell anyone about it because it  would have been a pu blic recognition of her  
uselessness. She concentr ated on a silent schoolin g in the distances of things and peoples voices, so 
that she would still be able to see with her memo ry what the shadows of her cataracts no longer 
allowed her to. Later on she was to d iscover the un foreseen help of odors, which wer e defined in 
the shadows with a strength that was much more c onvincing than that of bulk and color, and which 
saved her finally from the shame of admitting defeat. In the darkness of the room she was able to 
thread a needle and sew a buttonhole and she knew when the milk was about to boil. She knew with 
so much certainty the location of everything that she herself forgot that she was blind at times. On 
one occasion Fernanda had the whole house u pset because she h ad los t her weddi ng ring, and 
Úrsula foun d it on a shelf in the children’s be droom. Quite simply, while the oth ers were goin g 
carelessly all about, she watched them  with her four  senses so that they never took her by surprise,  
and after some time she discovered that every memb er of the family, without realizing it, repeated 
the same path every day, the same actions, and al most repeated the sam e words at the same hour.  
 122GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Only when they deviated from meticulous routine did they run the risk of losing something. So  
when she heard Fernanda all upset b e cause she had lost her ring, Úrsula remembered  that th e onl y 
thing different that sh e had done tha t day was to  put the m attresses out in the sun because Meme 
had found a bedbug the might before. Since the child ren had been present at the fumigation, Úrsula 
figured that Fernanda had put the ring in the on ly place where they could not reach it: the shelf. 
Fernanda, on the other hand, looked for it in vain along the paths of her ev eryday itinerary without 
knowing that the search for lost things is hindered by  routine habits and th at is why it i s so difficult 
to find them. 
The rearing of José Arca dio helped Ú rsula in the exhausting tas k of keeping herself up to  date on 
the smallest changes in the house. When she realized  that Am aranta was d ressing the saints in the 
bedroom she pretended to show the b oy the differences in the colors. 
“Let’s see,” she would tell  him. “Tell me what  color the Archa ngel Raphael is wearing.” 
In that wa y the child gave her the inf ormation tha t was denied  her by her eyes, and lon g before 
he went awa y to the seminary Úrsula could already distinguish the different colors of the saints’ 
clothing by the texture.  Sometimes  unfores een accidents would happen. One afternoon when 
Amaranta was ‘embroidering on the porch with  the begonias Úrsula bumped into her. 
“For heaven’s sake,” Amaranta protested. “watch where you’re going.” 
“It’s your fa ult,” Úrsula said. “You’re not sitting where you’re supposed to.” 
She was  sure of it. But th at day she began to rea lize something that no  one had noticed and it was  
that with the passage of the year the sun imperceptibly changed position and those who sat on th e 
porch had to  change their  position little by little without being aware of it. From then on Úrsula had 
only to remember the date in order to know exa ctly where Am aranta was si tting. Even though the 
trembling of her hands was more and more noticea ble and the weight of her feet was too much for 
her, her small figure was never seen in so many places at the same time. She was almost as diligent as  
when she ha d the whole weight of the house on her shoulders. Nevertheless, in the impenetrable 
solitude of decrepitude s he had such  clairvoyance as  she exami ned the most insignificant happenings  
in the family that for the first time she saw clearl y the truths that her busy life in former times ha d 
prevented her from seeing. Around  the time they were preparing José Arcadio for the seminary she 
had already made a  detai led recapitul ation of life in the house since th e founding of Macondo an d 
had completely changed the opinion that she had  alwa ys held of her descendants. She realized tha t 
Colonel Aureliano Buend ía had not lost his love for th e family because he h ad been hard ened by th e 
war, as she had thought before, but that he had ne ver loved anyone, not even his wife Remedios or  
the coun tless one-night women who  had passed th rough his life, and much less his sons. She sensed 
that he had  fought so many wars not out of idealism, as everyone had thought, nor had he 
renounced a  certain victory because of fatigue, as  everyone had thought, but that he had won and  
lost for the same reason, pure and sinful pride. She reached th e conclusion  that th e son  for whom 
she would h ave given he r life was simply a man in capable of love. One night when she was carrying  
him in her belly she hear d him weepi ng. It was suc h a definite lament tha t José Arcad io Buendía  
woke up b eside her and  was happ y with the idea th at his son was going to be a ventril oquist. Other 
people predicted that he would be a prophet. She,  on the other hand, shuddered from t he certainty 
that the d eep moan was a first indica tion of the fearful pig tail and she begged God to  let the child 
die in her womb. But the lucidity of her old age allowed  her to see, and she said so many times, tha t 
the cries of children in their mothers’ wombs are not announcements of ventriloquism or a faculty 
for prophecy but an un mistakable sign of an inca pacity for lo ve. The lowering of the image of her  
son brought out in her all at once all the compassi on that she o wed him. Amaranta, ho wever, whose 
hardness of heart frightened her, whose concen trated bitterness made her bitter, suddenly becam e 
clear to h er in the final an alysis as the most ten der woman wh o had ever exis ted, and sh e understood 
with pitying clarity that the unjust tortures to  which she had submitted Pietro Crespi had not been  
 123GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
dictated b y a desire for vengeance, a s everyone  had thought, nor had the slow martyrdom with 
which she h ad frustrated the life of C olonel Gerineldo Márquez been  determined by th e gall of her  
bitterness, as everyone had thought, but that bot h actions had been a mortal struggle between a  
measureless love and an invincible cowardice, and that the irrational fear that Amaranta had always  
had of her own tormented heart ha d triumphed in the end. It was during that time that Úrsula, 
began to speak Rebeca’s name, bringing back the me mory of her with an old love that was exalted  
by tardy repentance and  a sudden ad miration, coming  to und erstand th at only she, R ebeca, th e one 
who had never fed of her milk but only of the eart h of the land and the whiteness of the walls, the 
one who did  not carry the blood of her veins in he rs but the u nknown blood of the str angers whos e 
bones were still clocing in their grave. Rebeca, th e one with an  impatient heart, th e one with a fierce 
womb, was the only one who bad the unbridled co urage that Úrsula had wanted for her line. 
“Rebeca,” she would say, feeling along the walls, “how unfair we’ve been to you!” 
In the house they simply thought that her mind wa s wandering, especially si nce the time she had  
begun walking about with her right arm raised like the Archangel Gab riel. Fernanda, however, 
realized that there was a sun of clairvoyance in th e shadows of t hat wand ering, for Úrsula  could say 
without hesi tation how much m oney had been  spent in the house d uring the previous year. 
Amaranta  had a similar idea one d ay as her mother  was stirring a pot of sou p in the kitchen and said  
all at once without knowing that they were listening to her that the corn  grinder they had bought 
from the first gypsies and  that had dis appeared du ring the time before José Arcadio, had  taken hi s 
sixty-five trips around the world was still in Pilar Ternera’s house. Also almost a hundred years old, 
but fit and a gile in spite of her inconceivable fatn ess, which frightened children as her laughter had 
frightened the doves in  other times, Pi lar Terner a was not surprised that Úrsula was correct b ecaus e 
her own experience was beginning to tell her that an alert old age can be mor e keen than the cards. 
Nevertheless , when Úrsula realized tha t she had not had enough time to cons olidate the v ocation 
of José Arcadio, she let herself be dist urbed by c onsternation. She began to make mistakes, trying to 
see with h er eyes the thi ngs that intu ition allowed  her to see with greater clarity. One morning she 
poured the contents of an inkwell over the boy’s head thinking that it was rose water. She stumbled  
so much in her insistence in taking part in everything that she felt herself upset by gusts of ba d 
humor and she tried to get rid of the shadows th at were begi nning to wrap her in a straitjacket of  
cobwebs. It was then that it occur red to her that her clumsiness was  not the first victory of 
decrepitude and darkness but a sen tence passed b y time. She th ought that p reviously, when God did  
not make th e same traps  out of the months and years that th e Turks used when they measured a  
yard of percale, things were different. Now ch ildren not only grew faster, but even feelings 
developed in a different way. No sooner had Reme dios the Beauty ascended to heaven in body an d 
soul than th e inconsiderate Fernanda  was going about mumbl ing to herself because her sheets had  
been carried  off. The bodies of the Aurelianos were no soo ner cold in their graves than Aurelian o 
Segundo had the house lighted up a gain, filled wi th drunkards playing t he accordion and dousing 
themselves i n champagn e, as if dogs and not Chris tians had died, and as if that madhou se which had  
cost her so many headaches and so many candy animals was destined to become a tr ash heap of 
perdition. Remembering those thing s as she prepar ed José Arcadio’s trunk, Úrsula wondered if it 
was not preferable to lie down once a nd for all in her grave and let them throw the ear th over her, 
and she asked God, without fear, if h e really believe d that people were made of iron in order to bear 
so many troubles and mortifications, and asking  over and over she was stirring up her ow n 
confusion and she felt irrepressible desires to let herself go and scamper about like a foreigner and  
allow herself at l ast an instant of  rebellion, that instant yearned f or so many ti mes and  so many times  
postponed, putting her r esignation as ide and shitti ng on everything once and for all and drawing out 
of her heart the infinite stacks of bad words that she had been forced to swallow over a century of 
conformity. 
 124GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“Shit!” she shouted. 
Amaranta,  who was s tarting to put the clothes  into the trunk, th ought that s he had b een bitten b y 
a scorpion. 
“Where is it?” she asked in alarm. 
“What?” 
“The bug!” Amaranta said. 
Úrsula put a finger on her heart. 
“Here,” she said. 
On Thursday, at two in  the afterno on, José Arcadio left for the seminary. ‘Úrsula would 
remember him always as she said good-bye to him, languid  and serious, wit hout shedding a tear, as 
she had taught him, swel tering in the heat in the green corduroy suit with copper buttons and a 
starched bo w around his neck. He l eft the dinin g room impregnated with  the pen etrating fragrance 
of rose water that she had sprinkled on his head so that she could follow his tracks through the 
house. While the farewell lunch was going on, t he family co ncealed its n ervousness with festive 
expressions and they celebrated with exaggerated enthusiasm th e remarks th at Father  Antonio Isabel  
made. But when they too k out the trunk bound in velv et and wi th silver corners, it was as  if they ha d 
taken a coffin out of the house. The only one wh o refused to take part in the farewell was Colonel 
Aureliano Buendía. 
“That’s all we need,” he muttered. “A Pope!” 
Three months later Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda took Meme to sch ool and cam e back with a  
clavichord, which took the place of the pianola. It was around that time that Amara nta started  
sewing her own shroud. The banana  fever had cal med down.  The ol d inhabitants of M acondo found 
themselves s urrounded by newcom ers and working hard to cling to their precarious resources of 
times gone by, but com forted in any case by th e sense that they had survived a shipwreck. In the 
house they still had guests for lunch and the old routine was never really set up again until the 
banana com pany left yea rs later. Nevertheless, ther e were radical changes in the traditio nal sense of  
hospitality b ecause a t that time it was Fernanda wh o imposed h er rules. With Úrsula relegated to th e 
shadows an d with Ama ranta absorb ed In th e work of her winding cloth, the form er apprentic e 
queen had the freedom to choose the guests and  impose on them the rigid norms that her parents 
had taught her. Her sever ity made the house a red oubt of old customs in a town convulsed by the 
vulgarity with which the outsiders squandered thei r easy fortunes. For her, with no further questions 
asked, proper people were those who had nothi ng to do wi th the b anana compan y. Even Jos é 
Arcadio Segundo, her brother-in-law, was the victim  of her discriminatory jealousy because during  
the excitem ent of the first days he gave up his stupendous fighting cocks again and took a job as 
foreman with the banan a company. 
“He won’t ever come into this house again,” Fernan da said, “a s long as he carries the ra sh of the 
foreign ers.” 
Such was the narrowness imposed in the house tha t Aureliano Segundo felt more comfortable a t 
Petra Cotes’ s. First, with the pre text of taking the burden off his wife, he transferred his parties.  
Then, with the pretext that the animals were l osing their fertility, he tr ansferred his barns an d 
stables. Finally, with the pretext tha t it was cool er in his concu bine’s house, he transferred the sm all 
office in which he handl ed his business. When Fe rnanda realized tha t she was a  widow whose 
husband had still not died, it was already too late for things to return to their former state. Aureliano 
Segundo barely ate at home and  the only appearances  he put in, such as  to sleep with h is wife, wer e 
not enough to convince anyone. One night, out of carelessness, morning found him in Petra Cotes’s  
bed. Fernanda, contrary to expecta tions, did not repr oach him  in the least or give the slightest sigh 
of resentment, but on the same day she sent two trunks with his clothing to the house of his 
concubine. She sent them in broad daylight and wi th instructions that th ey be carried through the 
 125GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
middle of the street so that everyone could see th em, thinking that her straying husband would be 
unable to bear the shame and would return to the fold with his head hung low. But that heroi c 
gesture was just one more proof of how poorly  Fernanda knew not onl y the character of her  
husband but the character of a community that had nothing to do with that of her parents, for 
everyone wh o saw th e trunks pass by said tha t it was the n atural culmination of a story whos e 
intimacies were known to everyone, and Aurelian o Segundo celebrated the freedom he had received  
with a party that lasted for three days. To the gr eater disadvantage of his wife, as she was entering  
into a sad m aturity with her somber long dresses,  her old-fashioned med als, and her out-of-place 
pride, the concubine seemed to be b ursting with a second you th, clothed in gaudy dresses of natural 
silk and with her eyes tiger-striped with a glow of  vindication. Aureliano Se gundo gave himself over 
to her again with the fury of adolescen ce, as befo re, when Petra Cotes had n ot loved him  for himself 
but because she had him mixed up with his twin brother and as she slept with both  of them  at th e 
same time s he thought that God had  given her th e good fortune of having  a man who could make 
love like two. The restored passion was so pressing that on more than on e occasion they would look 
each other i n the eyes a s they were getting read y to eat and without sayi ng anything they would  
cover their p lates and  go into the bed room dying of hunger and of love. Inspired by th e things h e 
had seen on his furtive visits to the French ma trons, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a bed  
with an archiepiscopal canopy, put velvet curtains  on the wind ows, and covered the cei ling and the 
walls of the bedroom with large rock-crystal mirro rs. At the sa me time h e was more of a carouser  
and spendth rift than ever . On th e trai n, which arri ved every da y at eleven  o’clock, he would receive 
cases and more cases of champagne and brandy. On  the way back from the station he would drag 
the improvised cumbiamba  along in full view of all the peop le on the way, natives or outsiders, 
acquaintances or people yet to be kn own, withou t distinctions  of any kind . Even the s lippery Mr. 
Brown, who talked only in a strange tongue, let himself be seduced b y the tempting  signs that 
Aureliano Segundo made him and s everal times he got dead  drunk in Petra Cotes’s h ouse and h e 
even made the fierce German shepherd dogs that  went everywhere with him dance to some Texas  
songs that he himself mumbled in one way or a nother to the a ccompanimen t of the acco rdion. 
“Cease, cows,” Aureliano Segundo shouted a t the height of the party. “Cease, becau se life is  
short.” 
He never looked better, nor had he been loved more, nor had the breed ing of his animals been 
wilder. There was  a slaug htering of so many cows,  pigs, and chickens for the endless p arties tha t the 
ground in the courtyard turned black and muddy with so mu ch blood. It was an etern al execution  
ground of bones and innards, a mud pit of left overs, and they had to keep exploding dynamite 
bombs all the time so that the buzza rds would not pluck out the guests’ eyes. Aurelia no Segundo 
grew fat, purple-colored, turtle-shaped, because of  an appetite comparab le only to that of José 
Arcadio wh en he cam e back from traveling arou nd the world. The prestige of his outlandish 
voracity, of his immense capacity as a  spendthrift,  of his unprecedented hospitality wen t beyond th e 
borders of the swamp a nd attracted the best-qual ified gluttons from all along the coas t. Fabulous 
eaters arrived from everywhere to take part in th e irrational tourneys of capacity and resistance tha t 
were organized in the ho use of Petra Cotes. Aureliano Segundo was the un conquered eater until th e 
luckless Saturday when Camila Sagastume appeared, a totemic female known all through the land by 
the good na me of “The Elephant.” T he duel la sted until dawn  on Tuesday.  During the first twenty-
four hours, having dispatched a dinner of veal, with  cassava, yams, and fried b ananas, and a case and 
a half of c hampagne in addition, Aureliano Segundo was sure of victory. He seemed more  
enthusiastic, more vital th an his imper turbable adversary, who possessed a style th at wa s obviously 
more profes sional, but a t the same time less emotional for t he large cro wd that fille d the house.  
While Aureliano Segundo ate with great bites, overcome by th e anxiety of victory, The E lephant was 
slicing her meat with the art of a surgeon and eati ng it unhurriedly and ev en with a certain pleasure. 
 126GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
She was gigantic and sturdy, but over her colossal form a tenderness of femininity prevailed and she 
had a face that was so beautiful, hands so fine an d well cared for, and such an  irresistible personal 
charm that when Aureliano Segundo saw her enter the house he commen ted in a low voice that he  
would have preferred to have the tou rney in bed and not at the table. Later on, when  he saw her 
consume a side of veal without br eaking a sing le rule of good table manners, he commented  
seriously that that delicate, fascinating, and insa tiable proboscidian was in a certain way the ideal  
woman. He was not mistaken. The reputation of a bone crusher that had  preceded The Elephant 
had no basis. She was not a beef cruncher or a bear ded lady from a Greek circus, as ha d been said,  
but the director of a school of voice. She had le arned to ea t when she was already th e respectable 
mother of a  family, looking for a way for her childre n to eat b etter and  not by means  of any artificial  
stimulation of their app etites bu t through the a bsolute tran quility of th eir spirits. Her theory,  
demonstrated in practice,  was based  on the princi ple that a pers on who had all matters of  conscience 
in perfect sh ape should b e able to eat until overco me by fa tigue. And it wa s for moral reasons and  
sporting interest that she left her school and her home to co mpete with a man whos e fame as a 
great, unprincipled eater had spread throughout the country. From the first moment s he saw him 
she saw that Aureliano Segundo would lose not his st omach but his character. At the end of the first 
night, while The Elepha nt was boldly going on, Aureliano Segundo was  wearing himself out with a 
great deal of talking and laughing. They slept four  hours. On awakening each one had the juice of 
forty oranges, eight quarts of coffee, and thirty ra w eggs. On the second mo rning, after many hours 
without sleep and having put away two pigs, a bunc h of bananas, and four cases of champagne, The 
Elephant suspected that Aureliano Segundo had unknow ingly discovered the same method as hers, 
but by the absurd route of total irres ponsibility. He  was, ther efore, more dangerous than she had 
thought. Nevertheless, when Petra Cotes brought two roast turkeys to the table, Aureliano Segundo 
was a step away from being stuffed. 
“If you can’t, don’t eat an y more,” The Elephant s aid to him. “Let’s call it a tie.” 
She said it fr om her heart, understan ding that she could not eat ano ther m outhful either, out of  
remorse for bringing on the dea th of her adversary.  But Aureli ano Segundo interpreted  it as a nother  
challenge and he filled h imself with turkey beyond hi s incredible capacity. He lost consciousness. He 
fell face do wn into the plate filled with bones, frot hing at t he mouth like a dog, and drowning in  
moans of agony. He felt, in the midst of the darkne ss, that th ey were throwi ng him from  the top of a 
tower into  a bottomless  pit and in a last flash of consciousnes s he re alized  that at the end of tha t 
endless fall death was wai ting for him. 
“Take me to Fernanda,” h e managed to say. 
His friends left him at the house thinking that they had helped him fulfill h is promise to his wife  
not to die in his concubi ne’s bed. Petra Cotes had  shined his patent leather boots that he wanted to 
wear in his coffin, and she was already looking for someone to take them when they ca me to tell her 
that Aureliano Segundo was ou t of danger. He did recover, indeed , in less than a week, and two 
weeks later he was celeb rating the fact of his surviv al with unprecedented festivities. He continued 
living at Petra Cotes’s bu t he would visit Fernanda  every da y and sometimes he would stay to eat 
with th e fam ily, as if fate had reversed  the situat ion and had made him the husband of hi s concubine 
and the lover  of his wife. 
It was a rest for Fernanda. During the boredom  of her abando nment h er only distractio ns wer e 
the clavichord lessons at siesta time a nd the letter s from her children. In the detailed messages tha t 
she sent them every two  weeks there was not a si ngle line of truth. She hid her troubles from them.  
She hid from them the sa dness of a house which, in spite of the light on the begonias, in spite of the 
heaviness at two in the afternoon, in spite of the fr equent waves of festivals that came in from the 
street was m ore and mor e like the co lonial mansi on of her pa rents. Fernanda would wander alon e 
among the three living ghosts and the dead ghos t of José Arcadio Buendía, who at times would  
 127GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
come to sit down with  an inquisitive attention in  the h alf-light of the parl or while she was pla ying 
the clav ichord. Colonel Aureliano Buendía was a s hadow . Since the last ti me that he had gone out 
into the street to propos e a war without any future  to Colonel Geri neldo Márquez, he left the 
workshop only to urinate under the chestnut tree. He did not receive  any visits except that of the 
barber every three weeks, He fed on anything that Úrsula brought him once a day, and even thoug h 
he kept on making little gold fishes with the sa me passion as before, he stopped selling them when 
he found out that people were buying them not as pi eces of jewelry but as historic relics. He made a  
bonfire in the courtyard of the dolls of Remedios  which had decorated, their bedroom since their 
wedding. The watchful Úrsula realized what her so n was doing but she coul d not stop hi m. 
“You have a heart of stone,” she told him. 
“It’s not a question of a heart,” he said. “The room’s getting full of moths.” 
Amaranta was weaving her shroud. Fernanda did not understa nd why she would write occasional 
letters to Meme and even  send her gifts and on th e other hand did not even  want to hea r about José 
Arcadio. “They’ll die without knowing why,” Amaranta ans wered when  she was asked through 
Úrsula, and that answer planted an enigma in Fe rnanda’s hea rt that she was never a ble to clarify.  
Tall, broad-shouldered, proud, always dressed in abundant petticoats with  the lace an d in air of 
distinction that resisted the years and bad memories, Amaranta  seemed to carry the cross of ashes of 
virginity on her forehead. In reality she carried it  on her hand in the black bandage, which she did 
not take off even to sleep and which she washed and ironed herself. Her life was spent in weaving  
her shroud. It might have been said th at she wove  during the day and unwo ve during the night, and 
not with any hope of defeating solitude in that way,  but, quite the contrary, in order to nurture it. 
The greatest worry that Fernanda had during her years of abandonment was that Meme would 
come to spend her first vacation and  not find Au reliano Segundo at home. His congestion had pu t 
an end to that fear. When Meme returned, her parents had ma de an agreement that no t only would 
the girl think that Aureliano Segundo was still a do mesticated husband but also that she would not 
notice the sa dness of the house. Every year for two months Aureliano Segundo played his role of an 
exemplary husband and he organized  parties with  ice cream  and cookies which the g ay and lively 
schoolgirl enhanced with the clavichord. It was obvious from  then on that she had inherited very 
little of her mother’s cha racter. She seemed more of a second version of Amaranta when the latter 
had not kno wn bitternes s and was ar ousing the h ouse with  her dance step s at the age of twelve or  
fourteen before her secr et passion f or Pietro Crespi was to  twist th e direction of her heart in th e 
end. But unlike Amaranta, unlike all of them, Meme still did not reveal the solitary fate of the family 
and she seemed entirely in conformity with the worl d, even when she would shut herself up in the 
parlor at two in the afternoon to practice the clavic hord with an inflexible discipline. It was obvious  
that she liked the house, that she spent the whol e year dreami ng about the excitemen t of the young  
people her arrival brought around, and that she wa s not far removed from the festive v ocation and  
hospitable excesses of her father. The first sign of  that calami tous inherita nce was revealed on her  
third vacation, when Meme appeared  at the hous e with four nuns and sixty-eight classmates who m 
she had invited to spend  a week wi th her family on her own  Initiative an d without a ny previous 
warning. 
“How awful!” Fernanda lamented. “T his child is as much of a barbarian as her father!” 
It was neces sary to borrow beds and hammocks from  the neighbors, to set up nine shifts at the 
table, to fix hours for bathing, and to borrow forty stools so  that th e girls in blue uniforms with 
masculine buttons would not spend the whole day ru nning from one place to another. The visit was  
a failure because the nois y schoolgirls would scarcely finish bre akfast before they had to start taking  
turns for lunch and then for dinner, and for the whole week th ey were abl e to take only one walk  
through the plantations. At nightfall the nuns were exhausted,  unable to move, give another order, 
and still the troop of tireless adolescents was in th e courtyard singing school songs out of tune. One 
 128GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
day they were on the poi nt of trampli ng Úrsula, who made an effort to be useful precisely where sh e 
was most in the way. On another day the nuns got all excited because Colonel Aureliano Buendía 
had urinated  under the chestnut tree without being concer ned that the schoolgirls were in the 
courtyard. Amaranta was  on th e poi nt of causin g panic because one of th e nuns went into the 
kitchen as she was salting the soup and the only thing that occurred to her to say was to ask wha t 
those handfuls of white powder were.  
“Arsenic,” Amaranta ans wered. 
The night of their arrival the students carried on in such a way, trying to go to the b athroom  
before they went to bed, that at one o’clock in the morning the last ones were still goin g in. 
Fernanda then bought seventy-two chamberpots  but she only managed to change the nocturnal  
problem into  a morning o ne, becaus e from dawn o n there was  a long line o f girls, each with her po t 
in her hand, waiting for her turn to wash it. Altho ugh some of th em suffered fevers and several of  
them were in fected by mo squito bites, most of them showed an unbreakable resistance as they faced  
the most tro ublesome difficulties, and even at the time of th e greatest heat they would scamper  
through the garden. When they finally left, the flo wers were destroyed, the furniture broken, and the 
walls covered with drawings and writing, but Fern anda pardoned them for all of the damage becaus e 
of her relief at th eir leaving. She retu rned the borrowed beds and stools and kept the seventy-two 
chamberpots  in Melquíades’ room. The locked ro om, about which the spiritual life of the hous e 
revolved in former times, was known from that  time on as the “chamberpot room.” For Colonel 
Aureliano B uendía it wa s the most a ppropriate n ame, becaus e while the r est of th e family was s till 
amazed  by the fact that Melquíades’ room was i mmu ne to  dust and destruction, he s aw it turned 
into a dunghill. In any c ase, it did n ot seem to bother him who was correct, and if he found out 
about the fate of the room it was because Fernanda kept passing by and disturbing his work for a 
whole afternoon as she put away the chamberpots.  
During those days José Arcadio Segundo rea ppeared in the house. He went along the porch 
without greeting anyone and he shu t himself up in the workshop to ta lk to the colonel. In spite of  
the fact th at she could n ot see him, Úrsula analyz ed the clicking of his foreman’s boots and was  
surprised at the unbridgeable distance that sep arated him from the family, even from the twi n 
brother with whom he had played ingenious games of confusion in childhood and with whom he no 
longer had a ny traits in common. He was linear, solemn, and had a pensiv e air and the sadness of a 
Saracen and a mournful glow on his face that wa s the color of autumn. He was the on e who most 
resembled his mother, Santa Sofía de la Piedad. Úr sula reproached herself for the habit of forgetting 
about him when she sp oke about the family, b ut when sh e sensed him  in the hous e again an d 
noticed that the colonel let him into the works hop during working hours, she reexamined her old 
memories and confirmed the belief that at some moment in childhood he had changed  places with 
his twin brother, because it was  he and not the other one who should have  been called Aureliano. 
No one knew the details  of his life. At one time it  was discov ered that he had no fixed abode, th at 
he raised fighting cocks a t Pilar Ternera’s house an d that so metimes he would stay there to sleep but 
that he almo st always spent the night in the rooms of the French matrons. He drifted about, with no  
ties of affection, with no a mbitions, like a wanderin g star in Úrsula’s planetary system. 
In reality, José Arcadio Segundo was not a member  of the fa mily, nor would he ever be of any 
other since that distant d awn when  Colonel Geri neldo Márquez took him to the barracks, not so 
that he coul d see an execution, but so that for th e rest of his life he would never forget the sad and  
somewhat m ocking smile of the man being shot. Th at was not only his oldest memory, but the onl y 
one he had of his childhood. The other one, that of an old man with an old-fashioned vest and a ha t 
with a brim like a crow’s wings who told him marvelous things framed in a dazzling window, he wa s 
unable to pl ace in any p eriod. It was  an uncertai n memory, entirely devoid of lessons or nostalgia, 
the opposite of the memory of the executed man , which had really set the direction of his life and 
 129GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
would return to his memory clearer  and dearer as  he grew older, as if the passage of time wer e 
bringing him closer to it. Úrsula tried to use José Arcadi o Segundo to get Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía. to give up his imprisonment. “Get him to go  to the movies,” she said to him.  “Even if he 
doesn’t like the picture, a s least he’ll b reathe a  little fresh air.” But it did not take her lon g to realize 
that he was a s insensible to her begging as the colo nel would ha ve been, and  that th ey were armored 
by the same impermeability of affection. Although  she never knew, nor did anyone know, what they 
spoke about in their prolonged sessions shut up in the workshop, she understood that they wer e 
probably the only members of the family who seem ed drawn together by som e affinity. 
The truth is that not even José Arcadio Segundo wo uld have been able to draw the colonel out of 
his confinement. The inv asion of schoolgirls had lo wered th e limits of his p atience. With  the pretext 
that his wed ding bedroom was at the mercy of th e moths in s pite of the d estruction of Remedios’ 
appetizing d olls, he hung a hammock  in the workshop and then he woul d leave it only to go into th e 
courtyard to  take care of his necessities. Úrsula was unab le to string together even a trivial 
conversation  with him. She knew th at he did not l ook at the di shes of food but would p ut them at 
one end of his workbench while h e finished a littl e fish and i t did not ma tter to  him i f the soup  
curdled or if the meat go t cold. He grew harder a nd harder ever since Colonel Gerineldo Márquez 
refused to back him up in a senile war. He locked  himself up inside himself and the family finally 
thought of him is if he were dead. No other hu man reactio n was seen  in him until one Octo ber 
eleventh, when he went to the. street door to watch a circus parade. For Colonel Aureliano Buendía  
it had been a day just like  all those of his last yea rs. At five o’clock in the morning the noise of the 
toads and cri ckets outside the wall wo ke him up. The drizzle ha d persisted since Saturday and there 
was no necessity for him to hear their tiny whisperi ng among the leaves of the garden because he 
would have f elt the cold i n his bones i n any case. He was, as  always, wrapped in his woolen blanket 
and wearing his crude cotton long dr awers, which he still wore for co mfort, even though because of  
their musty, old-fashioned style he ca lled them his “Goth drawers.” He put on his tight pants bu t 
did not button them up, nor did he put the gold button into his shirt collar as he always did, becaus e 
he planned to take a bath. Then he put the blank et over his head like a cowl. brushed his dripping  
mustache with his fingers , and went to urinate in the courtyard. There was still so much time left for  
the sun to come out that José Ar cadio Buendía was still dozing under the shelter of palm f ronds that 
had been  rotted b y the rain. He did not see him, as he had n ever seen hi m, nor did he hear th e 
incomprehensible phrase that the gh ost of his father  addressed to him as he awakened , startled by 
the stream of hot urine that splattered his shoes. He put the bath off for later, not because of the 
cold and th e dampn ess, but b ecaus e of the op pressive October mist. On  his way back to th e 
workshop he noticed the odor of the wick that Santa Sofía de l a Piedad was  using to light the stoves, 
and he waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil so that he co uld take along his mug without sugar. 
Santa Sofía de la Piedad asked him, as on every morning, what day of the week it was, and h e 
answered th at it was Tu esday, Octo ber eleventh . Watching the glow of the fire as it gilded the 
persistent woman who neither then  nor in any instant of her life seemed to exist completely, h e 
suddenly remembered that on one October elev enth in the middle of the war he had  awakened with  
the brutal certainty that the woman with whom he  had slept was dead. She really was and he could  
not forget the date beca use she had asked him an hour before what da y it was. In spite of the 
memory he did not have an awarenes s this time either of to what degree his omens had  abandoned  
him and while the coffee was boiling he kept on th inking out of pure curiosity but without the 
slightest risk of nostalgia about the woman whos e name he had never known and whose face he had 
not seen  because she h ad stumbled to  his hammock in the dark.  Nevertheles s, in the emp tiness of so  
many women who came into his life in the same way, he did not remem ber that she was the one 
who in the delirium of that first meeting was on the point of foundering in her own tears an d 
scarcely an hour before her death had  sworn to love him until she died. He did not think about her  
 130GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
again or about any of the others after he went in to the workshop with the steaming cup, and he 
lighted the l amp in order to count the little gold  fishes, which he kept in a tin p ail. There  were  
seventeen  of them. Since he had d ecided not to s ell any, he k ept on m aking two fishes a day an d 
when he fin ished twenty-five he would melt them down an d start all o ver again. He worked all 
morning, absorbed, without thinking about anyth ing, without realizing that at ten o’clock the rai n 
had grown stronger and someone ran past the wo rkshop shouting to close the doors before the 
house was  flooded, and without thin king even ab out himself until Úrsula came in  with  his lunch an d 
turned out the light. 
“What a rain!” Úrsu la said. 
“October,” he said. 
When he sai d it he did not raise his eyes from the first little fish of the day because he was putting 
in the rubies for the eyes. Only when h e finished it and put it wi th the o thers in the pail di d he begin  
to drink the soup. Then, very slowly, he ate th e piece of meat roasted with  onions, the white rice, 
and the slices of fried bananas all on the s ame plate together. His appetite did not ch ange under  
either the b est or the h arshest of circumstances.  After lunch  he felt the drowsiness of inactivity.  
Because of a kind of scientific superstition he nev er worked, o r read, or ba thed, or mad e love until  
two hours of  digestion had gone by, and it was su ch a deep-rooted belief that several  times he held 
up military operations so as not to submit the troops  to the risks of indigestion. So he lay down in 
the hammo ck, removing the wax from his ears with a penknife, and in a few minutes h e was asleep.  
He dreamed  that he was  going into an empty hou se with white walls and  that he was u pset by th e 
burden of being the first human being  to en ter it. In the dream he rememb ered that he h ad dreamed  
the same thi ng the night before and on many nights  over the past years and he knew that the image 
would be erased from his memory wh en he awaken ed because that recurren t dream had the quality 
of not being remembered except within the drea m itself. A moment later, indeed, when the barb er 
knocked at the workshop door, Colonel Aureliano Bue ndía awo ke with the i mpression that he ha d 
fallen asleep involun tarily for a few seconds and that he had not had time to dream anythi ng. 
“Not today.” he told the barb er. “We’ll make it on Friday.” 
He had a th ree-day beard speckled with white h airs, but he did not think it necessary to shave 
because on Friday he was going to have his hair cu t and it could all be done at the same time. The 
sticky swea t of the unwa nted siesta  aroused the scars of the sores in  his armpits. The s ky had cleared 
but the sun had not come out. Colonel Aureliano Buendía released a sonorous belch which brought  
back the a cidity of the so up to his palate and wh ich was like a command from his organism to throw 
his blanket over his shoulders and go to the toil et. He stayed there longer than was necessary, 
crouched ov er the d ense fermentation  that was co ming out of the wood en box until habit told him 
that it was  time to  start work again. During the time he lingered he rem embered agai n that it was  
Tuesday, and that José Arcadio Segundo had not co me to the workshop because it was payday on  
the banan a company farms. That recollection, as all of those of the past few years, led  him to thin k 
about th e war without h is realizing it. He reme mbered that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had on ce 
promised to get him a horse with a white star on its face and that he had never spoken about it 
again. Then he went on toward scattered episodes  but he brou ght them ba ck without a ny judgment 
because since he could not think about anythi ng else, he had learned  to think coldly so that 
inescapable memories would not tou ch any feeling. On his way back to the workshop, seeing that 
the air was beginning to dry out, he decided that it  was a good time to take a bath, but Amaranta ha d 
got there ahead of him. So he started  on the second  little fish of the day. He was putti ng a hook on 
the tail when  the sun cam e out with such strength that the light creaked like a fishing boat. The air, 
which had been washed by the three-day drizzle,  was filled with flying ants. Then he came to the 
realization that he felt like urinat ing and he had  been putting it off until he had finished fixing the 
little fish. He went ou t into the courtyard at ten  minutes after f our, when h e heard th e distant brass 
 131GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
instruments, the beating of the bass drum and the shouting of the children, and for the first time 
since his youth he knowingly fell int o a trap of  nostalgia and relived that prodigious afternoon Of 
the gypsies when his father took hi m to s ee ice. Santa Sofía de la Piedad dropped what she was 
doing in the kitchen and r an to the do or. 
“It’s the circus,” she shouted. 
Instead of going to the chestnut tree, Colonel Au reliano Buend ía also wen t to the street door and  
mingled with the bystand ers who, were watching the parade. He saw a wom an dressed in gold sitting 
on the head  of an elephant. He s aw a sad  dromed ary. He s aw a b ear dr essed like a Dutch girl 
keeping time to the musi c with a sou p spoon and  a pan. He s aw the clowns doing cartwheels at th e 
end of the p arade and o nce more he saw the fa ce of his miserable solitude when ev erything had 
passed by an d there was nothing but the bright expa nse of the street and the air full of flying ants 
with a few onlookers peering into  the precipice of uncertainty.  Then he went to the chestnut tree,  
thinking about the circus, and while h e urinated he tried to keep on thinking about the circus, but he 
could no longer find the memory. He pulled his head  in between his shoulders like a baby chick and  
remained m otionless with his forehead against th e trunk of the chestnu t tree. The fa mily did not 
find him until the following day at eleven o’clock in the mornin g when Santa Sofía de la Piedad went 
to throw out the garbage in back and her atten tion was attra cted by the des cending vultures.

Chapter 14 
MEME’S LAST VACA TIONS coincided with the period of mourning for Colonel Aureliano Buendía.  
The shuttered house was no place for parties. They spoke in whispers, ate in silence, recited the 
rosary three times a d ay, and even  clavichord practice during the hea t of siesta tim e had a funereal  
echo. In spite of her secr et hostility toward the co lonel, it was Fernanda who imposed the rigor of 
that mourni ng, impressed by the solemnity with which the government exalted the m emory of its 
dead enemy. Aureliano Segundo, as was his custom  came b ack to sleep i n the house during his 
daughter’s vacation and  Fernanda must have done  some.  thing to regain her privileges as his 
legitimate wi fe because the following year Meme found a newborn little sister who against the 
wishes of her mother had  been bapti zed with the n ame Am aranta Úrsula. 
Meme had fi nished her course of study. The dipl oma tha t certified her as a concert cla vichordist 
was ratified by the virtuosity with whi ch she ex ecuted popular melodies of the seventeenth centur y 
at the gather ing organized to celebrate the compl etion of her studies and with which the period of  
mourning came to in end . More than her art, the guests admired her duality.  Her frivolous and even 
slightly infantile character  did not seem up to any serious activity, but when she sat down at the 
clavichord she became a different girl, one whose un foreseen maturity gave her the air of an adult.  
That was ho w she had always been. She really did am have any definite vocation, but she had earned  
the highest grades by means of inflexible discip line simply in order not to annoy her mother. They 
could have imposed on her an apprenticeship in any other field and the results would have been th e 
same. Since she had been very sma ll she had  been troubled by Fernan da’s strictness, her custom of  
deciding in favor of extremes; and she would have been capa ble of a much more difficult sacrifice 
than the clavichord lessons merely not to run u p against her intransigence. During the graduation 
ceremonies she had the impression that the parchmen t with Gothic letters and illuminated capitals 
was freeing her from a compromise that she had accepted not so much out of obedience as out of 
convenience,  and she tho ught that from then  on n ot even  the insistent Fer nanda would  worry an y 
more about an instrument that even the nuns looked upon as a  museum fossil. During t he first years 
she thought that her calculations were mistaken beca use after she had put half the town to sleep, not 
only in the parlor but also at all charitable fu nctions, school ceremonies, and patriotic celebrations  
that took place in Ma condo, her mother still invited to the house every newcomer  whom she 
thought capable of appre ciating her daughter’s virt ues. Only after the death of Amaranta , when the 
family shut itself up again in a period of mourni ng, was Meme able to lock the clav ichord and forget 
the key in some dresser drawer without Fernanda’s being annoyed on finding out when and through 
whose fault it had been l ost. Meme b ore up under the exhibitions with the same stoicis m that sh e 
had dedicated to her apprenticeship. It was the pri ce of her freedom. Fernanda was so pleased with  
her docility and so proud of the admir ation that her art inspired that she was  never agains t the house 
being fall of girl friends, her spending the after noon in the groves, and going to the movies with 
Aureliano Segundo or some muted lady as long as the film was approved by Father Antonio Isabel  
from the pulpit. During those moments of relaxation Meme’s real tastes were revealed. Her 
happiness la y at th e oth er extreme from discipline , in noisy parties, in gossip about lovers, in 
prolonged sessions with her girl friends, wher e they learned to smoke and talked  about male 
business, and where they once got th eir hands on  some cane l iquor and ended up naked, measuring 
and compari ng the parts  of their bodies. Meme would never forget that night when she arrived 
home chewing licorice lozenges, an d without n oticing their consternati on, sat down at th e tabl e 
where Ferna nda and Am aranta were eating dinner without sa ying a word  to each o ther. She had 
spent two tremendous h ours in the bedroom of a gi rl friend, weeping with laughter a nd fear, and  
 133GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
beyond an  crises she ha d found the rare feeling of. bravery that sh e needed in order  to run a way 
from school and tell her mother in one way or a nother that she could use  the clavichord as an 
enema. Sittin g at the hea d of the table, drinking a chicken broth that landed in her stomach like an 
elixir of resurrection, Meme then s aw Fernanda an d Amaran ta wrapped i n an accus atory halo of 
reality. She had to make a great effort not to thro w at them their prissiness,  their poverty of spirit 
their delusions of grandeur. From the time of he r second vacation she had known that her father  
was living at home only in order to keep up ap pearances, an d knowing Fernanda as  she did and  
having arranged later to  meet Petra C otes, she tho ught that her  father was right. She also  would have 
preferred being the daug hter of the concubine. In  the h azines s of the al cohol Meme thought with  
pleasure about the scand al that woul d have taken place if she were to express her thoughts at that 
moment, an d the intimate satisfaction  of her roguishness was s o intense tha t Fernanda noticed it. 
“What’s the matter?” she asked. 
“Nothing,” Meme answered. “I was only now  discovering how much I loved you both.” 
Amaranta  was startled b y the obviou s burden of  hate th at the declaration carried. But Fernanda 
felt so moved that she thought she would go ma d when Meme awoke at midnight with her head  
splitting with pain and dr owning in vomited gall. She gave her a vial of castor oil, put compresses on 
her stomach and ice cubes on her head, and she made  her stay in bed for five days and follow the 
diet ordered by the new and outlandish French do ctor, who after examining her for more than two 
hours reached the foggy conclusion that she had  an ailment p eculiar to women. Having lost her 
courage, in a miserable state of demoralization, Me me had no other recourse but to bear up under it. 
Úrsula, completely blind  by then bu t still active and lucid, was the only one who guessed the exact 
diagnosis. “As far as I can see,” she thought, “t hat’s the sa me thing that happens to drunken 
people.” But she not onl y rejected  the idea, she r eproached h erself for the frivolity of her thought. 
Aureliano Segundo felt a twinge of conscience when  he saw Meme’s state of prostration and he 
promised himself to take better care of her in th e future. That was how the relation ship of jolly 
comradeship  was born between father and daughter, which freed him for a time from the bitter 
solitude of his revels and freed her from Fernanda ’s watchful eye without necessity of pr ovoking the 
domestic crisis that s eemed inevitable by th en. At that time Aureliano Segundo postponed any 
appointments in order to be with Meme, to take he r to the movies or the circus, and he spent the 
greater part of his idle ti me with  her. In r ecent times his an noyance with  the absurd obesity that 
prevented hi m from tying his shoes and his abus ive satisfacti on with all manner of a ppetites h ad 
began to sour his character. The discovery of his daughter restored his former joviality and th e 
pleasure of being with her was slowly leading him away from dissipation. Meme was entering a 
fruitful age. She was not beauti ful, a s Amaranta had never been, but on the other hand she was  
pleasant, uncomplicated, and she had  the virtue of making a good impression on peopl e from the 
first momen t. She had  a modem spirit that woun ded the anti quated sobri ety and poor ly disguised 
miserly hear t of Fernanda, and tha t, on the o ther hand, Aureliano Segundo took pleasure in 
developing. It was he who resolved to take her out of the bedroom she had occupied since 
childhood, where the fearful eyes of the saints still  fed her adol escent terrors, and he furnished for 
her a room with a royal bed, a large dressing tabl e, and velvet curtains, not realizing that he was 
producing a second version of Petra Cotes’s room. He was s o lavish with Meme th at he did no t 
even know how much money he gave her because sh e herself would take it out of his pockets, and 
he kept abreast of every kind of new beauty a id that arrived in the commissary of the banana  
company. M eme’s room became filled with pumice- stone cushions to polish her nails with, hair  
curlers, toothbrushes, drops to m ake her eyes la nguid, and so many and such new cosmetics and 
artifacts of beauty tha t every time Fernanda went i nto the room she was scandalized by the idea that 
her daughter’s dressing table must hav e been  the same as those of the French ma trons. Nevertheless  
Fernanda divided her time in those days between  little Amaranta Úrsula, who was mischievous and  
 134GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
sickly, and a  touching correspondence with the invi sible physicians. So that when she noticed the 
complicity b etween father and daughter the only pr omise she extracted from Aureliano Segundo was 
that h e woul d never take Meme to Petra Cotes’s  house. It was a meaningl ess demand because the 
concubine was so annoyed with the comradeship between her lover and his daughter that she did 
not want an ything to do  with her. Petra was to rmented b y an unknown fear, as if instinct wer e 
telling her th at Meme, by just wanting it, could su cceed in what Fernanda had been unable to do: 
deprive her of a love that by then she considered  assured unti l death. For the first time Aureliano 
Segundo had to tolerate the harsh expressions and th e violent tirades of his concubine, and he was 
even afraid that his wand ering trunks would make the return journey to his wife’s house. That did 
not happen.  No one kn ew a man  better th an Petra Cotes k new her lover and she k new tha t the 
trunks would remain where they had  been sent b ecause if Aureliano Segundo detested  anything it 
was com plicating his life with modifications and  changes. So the trunks sta yed wh ere th ey were an d 
Petra Cotes  set abou t reconquering the husband  by sharpening  the only weapons that his daughter 
could not us e on him. I t too was  an u nnecessary e ffort because Meme h ad no desire to  intervene in  
her father’s a ffairs and if she had, it wo uld certain ly have been  in favor of the concubine. She had n o 
time to both er anybody. She herself swept her room and made her bed, as the nuns had taught her. 
In the morning she took care of her clothes, sewing on the porch or using Amaranta’s old pedal  
machine. W hile the others were taking their sies tas she would practice th e clavichord for two hours,  
knowing tha t the daily s acrifice would keep Fe rnanda calm.  For the sam e reason sh e continued  
giving concerts at church fairs and school parti es, even though the req uests were l ess and less  
frequent. At nightfall she would fi x herself up, put  on one of her simple dresses and her stiff high 
shoes, and if she had nothing to do with her father  she woul d go to the homes of her girl friends, 
where she would stay until dinnertime. It was ra re that Aureli ano Segundo would not call for her 
then to take her to the m ovies. 
Among Meme’s friends there were three young Am erican girls who broke through the electrified  
chicken fence barrier and made friends with girls from Macondo. One of th em was Patri cia Brown.  
Grateful for the hospital ity of Aureli ano Segund o, Mr. Brown opened  the doors of his house to 
Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances, which were the only ones where gringos and natives 
mingled. When Fernanda found out  about it she forgot about Amaranta Úrsula and the invisible 
doctors for a momen t and becam e very melo dramat ic. “Just think,” she said to Mem e, “what th e 
colonel must be thinking in his grave.” She sought , of course, t he backing of Úrsula. But the blind 
old woman, contrary to what ever yone expected, saw nothing  reproachabl e in Meme’s going to the 
dances and making friends with American girls her own age as  long as she kept her strict habits and  
was not co nverted to the Protesta nt religion. Meme sensed the thou ght of her great-great-
grandmother very well and the day after the dances  she would get up earlier than usual to go to 
mass. Ferna nda’s opposition lasted until the day when Meme broke dow n her resista nce with the  
news that th e Americans  wanted to h ear her play the clavichord. The instrument was taken out of 
the house ag ain and carried to Mr. Br own’s, wher e the young concert artist really did r eceive very 
sincere appla use and the most en thusiastic congra tulations. From then on s he was  invited not onl y 
to the dances but also to the Sunday swim parties in the pool and to lunch once a week. Mem e 
learned to s wim like a professional, t o play tennis , and to eat Virginia ham wi th slices of pineapple. 
Among dan ces, swimmi ng, and ten nis she soo n found herself getting involved in the English 
language. Aureliano Segundo was s o enthusiasti c over the progress of his daughter that from a  
traveling salesman he bought a six-volume English encyclopedia with many color prints which  
Meme read in her spare time. The reading occupied the attention that she had formerly given to 
gossip about sweethearts  and th e experimental r etreats that she would g o through with her girl 
friends, not because i t was imposed as discipline but because she had  lost all interes t by th en in 
talking about mysteries  that were in th e public do main. She lo oked back o n the drunken episode as  
 135GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
an infantile a dventure and it seemed so funny to her that she told Aureliano Segundo about it and he 
thought it was more am using than s he did. “If yo ur mother only knew,” he told h er, doubling up 
with laughter, as he always said when he told her something in confidence. He had made her  
promise that she would let him kno w about h er first love affair with the same confidence, a nd 
Meme told h im that she l iked a redheaded American boy who had come to  spend his vacation with  
his parents. “What do you know,” Aureliano Segu ndo said, laughing. “If your mother only knew.” 
But Meme al so told him that the boy had gone back  to his cou ntry and had  disappeared  from sight. 
The maturity of her judgment ensured peace in the family. Aureliano Segundo then d evoted mor e 
time to Petra  Cotes, and a lthough his body and so ul no longer permitted hi m the debau ches of days  
gone by, he lost no chance to arrange them and to  dig out the accordion, which by then  had som e 
keys held in place by shoelaces. At home, Am aranta was weaving her interminable s hroud and  
Úrsula dragged about in her decrepitude through the dep ths of the shado ws where th e only thing  
that was still visib le was the ghost of José Arc adio Buendía under the chestnut tree. Fernanda 
consolidated  her authority. Her monthly letters to  her son José Arcadio at that time did  not carry a 
string of lies and she hid from him only her correspondence with the invisible doctors, who had  
diagnosed a benign tumor in her large  intestine and were prepa ring her for a telepathic o peration. 
It might hav e been  aid that pe ace and happiness reigned for a long  time in  the tired ma nsion of 
the Buendías if it had not been for the sudden death of Amaranta, which caused a new uproar. It 
was an unex pected event. Although she was old and isolated from everyone, she still looked firm 
and upright and with the health of a rock that sh e had always had. No one knew her thoughts since 
the afternoo n on which  she had  given Colonel  Gerineldo Márquez his final rejecti on and shut  
herself up to weep. She was not seen  to cry during  the ascensi on to heaven  of Remedios the Beauty 
or over the extermination of the Aurelianos or the death of Col onel Aureliano Buendía, who was  the 
person she l oved most i n this world, although she showed it only when they found hi s body under 
the ch estnut tree. She h elped pick u p the body. She dressed him in his soldier’s uniform, shaved 
him, combed his hair, and waxed his mustache better th an he had ever done in his days of glory. No 
one thought that there was any love in that act because they were accustomed to the familiarity of 
Amaranta with the rites of death. Fernanda wa s scandalized that she did not understand the 
relationship of Catholicism with life but only its rela tionship with death, a s if it were not a religion 
but a compendium of funeral conventions. Amaranta  was too wrapped up in the eggplant patch of  
her memories to understand those subtle apologetics. She had reached old age with all of her 
nostalgias intact. When s he listened to the waltzes of  Pietro Crespi she felt the same d esire to weep  
that she had had in adolescence, as if time and har sh lessons had meant no thing. The rolls of musi c 
that sh e hers elf had thro wn into the trash with the pretext that they h ad rotted from dam pness kept 
spinning and playing in her memory. She had tried to sink them into th e swampy p assion that sh e 
allowed hers elf with her nephew Aureliano José a nd she tried  to take refuge in th e calm and virile 
protection o f Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, but sh e had not been able to o vercome them, not even 
with the mo st desperate act of her old age when she would bathe the small José Arcadio three years  
before he was sent to the seminary and caress hi m not as a grandmother would have done with a 
grandchild, but as a wom an would have done with a man, as it was said that the French matrons did 
and as she had wanted to  do with Pietro Crespi at  the age of twelve, fourteen, when she saw him in 
his dancing tights and with the magic wand with wh ich he kept time to th e metronome. At times It 
pained her to have let that outpouring of misery follow its course, and at times it made her so angry  
that she wou ld prick her fingers wi th the needles, but what pained her most and enraged her most 
and made h er most bitter was the fragrant and wo rmy guava grove of love that was  dragging her 
toward death. Just as Colonel Aureliano Buendía t hought about his war, unable to avoid it, so 
Amaranta thought about Rebeca. But while her br other had managed to sterilize his memories, she 
had only managed to make hers more scalding. The only thing that she asked of God for many years  
 136GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
was that he would not visit on her the punishment of dying before Rebeca. Every time s he passed by 
her house and noted the progress of  destruction s he took com fort in the idea tha t God was listening  
to her. One afternoon, when she wa s sewing on the porch, she was a ssailed by the certai nty that she 
would be sitting in that place, in the sa me position, and under th e same light when they b rought her 
the news of Rebeca’s d eath. She sa t down to  wait  for it, as one waits for a  letter, and  the fact was  
that at on e time she woul d pull off buttons to s ew them on again so that ina ctivity would not make 
the wait lon ger and more anxious. No one in the house realized that a t that tim e Amaranta was 
sewing a fine shroud for Rebeca. Later on, when Aureliano Triste told how he had s een her changed  
into an app arition with leathery skin  and a fe w golden threa ds on her s kull, Amaranta was  not 
surprised because the sp ecter d escribed was  exactl y wha t she h ad been  imagining for some tim e. She  
had decided to restore Rebeca’s corpse, to disguise  with paraffin the damage to her face and make a  
wig for her from the hair of the saints. She woul d manufactu re a beautifu l corpse, with the linen  
shroud and a plush-lined coffin with purple trim. and she would put it at the dispo sition of the 
worms with splendid funeral ceremon ies. She worked out the plan with such hatred th at it made her 
tremble to think about the scheme, which she would have carried out in exactly the s ame way if it 
had been do ne out of love, but she would not allow herself to become u pset by the confusion and 
went on per fecting the details so minutely that s he came to be more tha n a specialist and was a  
virtuoso in the rites of death. The only thing that she did not keep In mind in her fearsome plan wa s 
that in spite of her pleas to God she might die befo re Rebeca.  That was, in  fact, what h appened. At 
the final moment, however, Amara nta did not feel  frustrated, but on  the contrar y, free of all 
bitterness because death had awarded  her the privilege  of announcing itself several years ahead o f 
time. She saw it on one burning afternoon sewing with her on the porch a short ti me after Meme 
had left for school. She saw it becaus e it was a woman dressed  in blue with long hair, w ith a sort of 
antiquated l ook, and with a certain resemblance to Pilar Ternera during the time when she had 
helped with the chores in the kitchen. Fernanda was present several times and did not see her, in 
spite of the fact tha t she was so real, so human, and on one occasion asked of Amaranta  the favor of 
thread ing a needle. Death did not tell her when  she was  going to die or wheth er her hour wa s 
assigned before that of R ebeca, bu t ordered her to  begin sewing her own shroud on the next sixth of  
April. She was authorized to make it as complicated  and as fine as she wanted, but just as honestly 
executed as Rebeca’s, and she was told that she woul d die without pain, fear, or bitterness at dusk o n 
the day that she finished it. Trying to waste th e most time possible, Amaranta ordered some rough  
flax and spun the thread herself. She did it so care fully that the work alone took four years. Then she 
started the s ewing. As s he got closer to the una voidable end  she began  to understan d that only a  
miracle would allow her to prolong the work past Rebeca’s dea th, but the very concentr ation gave 
her the calm ness that she needed  to accept the idea of frustration. It was th en tha t she understood 
the vicious circle of Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s little gold fishes. The wo rld was reduced to the 
surface of her skin and her inner self  was safe from all bitterness. It pained her not to have had tha t 
revelation many years bef ore when it had still been possible to purify memories and reconstruct the 
universe under a new light and evok e without tr embling Pietro Crespi’s smell of lavender at dusk 
and rescue Rebeca from her slough  of misery, not out of hatred or  out of love but because of the  
measureless understanding of solitude. The hatred  that she noticed one night in Memes words did 
not upset her because i t was directed  at her, but s he felt th e repetition of a nother adolescence tha t 
seemed as cl ean as  hers must have s eemed  and that, howev er, was alread y tainted  with  rancor. But 
by then  her acceptance o f her fate wa s so deep  that she was  not even  upset by the certainty th at all 
possibilities of rectification were closed to her. He r only objective was to finish the shroud. Instead 
of slowing it down with useless detail  as she ha d done in the beginning, she speeded up the work. 
One week b efore she cal culated that she would ta ke the l ast stitch on the night of February 4, and  
without revealing the motives, she suggested to Meme that s he move up a clavichord concert tha t 
 137GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
she had arra nged for the day after, bu t the girl paid  no attentio n to her. Am aranta th en looked for a 
way to delay for forty-eight hours, and she even t hought that death was giving her her way becaus e 
on the night of February fourth a storm cause d a break down at the power plant. But on t he 
following day, at eight in  the mornin g, she took th e last stitch  in the mos t beautiful piece of work 
that an y wo man had ever finished, and she anno unced witho ut the leas t bit of dramatics that sh e 
was going to die at dusk. She not onl y told the fa mily but the whole town , because Amaranta had  
conceived of the idea th at she could m ake up for a life of meanness with on e last favor to the world,  
and she thou ght that no o ne was in a b etter positio n to take letters to the dead. 
The news that Amaranta Buendía was sailing at dusk carrying the m ail of death spread 
throughout Macondo before noon, and at three i n the afternoon there was a whole carton full of 
letters in the parlor. Those who did not want to write gave Amaranta ver bal messages, which she 
wrote down in a noteboo k with the na me and date of  death of the recipient. “Don’t worry,” she told 
the senders. “The first thing I’ll do when I get ther e is to ask for him and give him your message.” It 
was farcical. Amaranta di d not show any upset or  the slightest sign of grief, and she even looked a  
bit rejuvenated by a duty accomplished. She was as stra ight and as thin as ever. If it had not been for  
her hardened cheekbones and a few missing teeth, she would have looked much youn ger than she 
really was. She herself arranged for them to put the letters in a box sealed with pitch a nd told them  
to place it i n her grave in a way bes t to prot ect it from the dampness. I n the morni ng she had a  
carpenter called who too k her measu rements for the coffin as she stood i n the parlor, as if it wer e 
for a new dress. She sho wed such vigor in her last  hours that Fernanda tho ught she was making fun 
of everyone. Úrsula, with  the experience that Buendías died without any illness, did not doubt at all 
that Am aranta had receiv ed an omen of death, but in any case she was tormented by the fear that 
with the business of the letters and th e anxiety of th e senders for them to a rrive quickly they would  
bury her alive in their confusion. So she set about clearing out the house, arguing with the intruders 
as she shouted at th em, a nd by four in the afterno on she was s uccessful. At that tim e Amaranta ha d 
finished dividing her things among the poor and ha d left on the severe coffin of unfinished boards 
only the ch ange of clothing and the si mple cloth sl ippers that s he would wear in death. She did not 
neglect tha t precau tion because she remembered th at wh en C olonel Aureliano Buendía died the y 
had to bu y a pair of new shoes for him becaus e all he had l eft were the b edroom slippers that h e 
wore in the workshop. A little before five Aure liano Segundo came to fetch  Meme for the concert 
and was surp rised that the house was  prepared for th e funeral. if anyone seemed alive a t the mom ent 
it was the serene Amara nta, who had even had e nough time to cut her corns. Aurelia no Segundo 
and Meme took leave of her with mocking far ewells and promised her that on th e following 
Saturday they would have a big resurrection party. Drawn by the public tal k that Amar anta Buendía  
was receivin g letters for the dead, Father Antonio  Isab el arrived at five o’cl ock for the l ast rites and 
he had to wa it for more than fifteen minutes for the recipient to come out of her bath. When he sa w 
her appear in a madapollam nightshirt and with her ha ir loose over her shoulders, the decrepit parish  
priest thought that it wa s a trick and sent the altar boy away. He thought however, that he would 
take advanta ge of the occasion to have Amaranta  confess after twenty year s of reticen ce. Amaran ta 
answered simply that sh e did not need spiritual he lp of any kind because her conscience was clea n. 
Fernanda was scandalized . Without caring that pe ople could hear her she asked herself a loud what 
horrible sin Amaranta had commit ted to make her prefer an impious death to th e shame of 
confession. Thereupon Amaranta la y down and  made Úrsu la give public testimony as to her 
virgin ity. 
“Let no one have any il lusions,” she shouted  so that Fernanda would  hear h er. “Amaranta 
Buendía is leaving this world just as she came into it. 
She did not get up again.  Lying on cushions, as if she really were ill, she braided her long hair and 
rolled it about her ears as death had  told her it should be on her bier. Then she asked  Úrsula for a  
 138GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
mirror and for the first time in more than fort y years sh e saw her  face,  devasta ted by age and  
martyrdom, and she was  surprised at how much  she resembled the m ental image tha t she had of 
herself. Úrsula understood by the silence in the bedroom that i t had begun to grow dark. 
“Say good-b ye to Fernanda,” she begged her. On e minute of reconciliation is worth more than a 
whole life of friendship.” 
“It’s of no use now,” Amaranta replied. 
Meme could  not help thi nking about her when th ey turned on  the lights on the improvised stage 
and she began the secon d part of the program. In the middle of the piece someone wh ispered the 
news in her ear and the s ession stopped. When he arrived home, Aureliano Segundo had to push his 
way through  the crowd to see the co rpse of the ag ed virgin, ugly and discolored, with the bla ck 
bandage on her hand and wrapped in the magnificent shroud. She was laid out in the parlor beside 
the box of letters. 
Úrsula did not get up  again after the nine nights of mourning fo r Amaran ta, Santa Sofía de la 
Piedad took care of her. She took her  meals to her bedroom a nd annatto  water for her to wash in 
and she kep t her up to  date on everyth ing that hap pened in Ma condo. Aurel iano Segundo visited her  
frequently and he brought her clothing which she would place beside the bed along with the things  
most indispensable for daily life, so that in a shor t time she had built up a world within reach of h er 
hand. She managed to arouse a great love in little Amaranta Úr sula, who was just like her, and whom 
she taught how to read. Her lucidity, the ability to be sufficient un herself made one think that sh e 
was naturally conquered by the weight of her hund red years, but even though it was obvious that sh e 
was having trouble seeing, no one suspected th at she was total ly blind. She had so much time at her  
disposal then and so much interior silence to watc h over the life of the house that she was the first 
to notice Meme’s silent tribulation. 
“Come here,” she told her. “Now that were alone, confess to this poor old woman what’ s 
bothering you.” 
Meme avoided the conv ersation with a short laugh. Úrsula did not insist, but she ended up 
confirming her suspicions when Meme did not come back to visit her. She kn ew th at she was getting  
up earlier than usual, that she did not have a moment ’s rest as she waited for the time for her to go  
out, that sh e spent whole nights wal king back and forth in the adjoinin g bedroom, and that the  
fluttering of a butterfly would bother her. On one o ccasion she said that she was going to see Aureli-
ano Segundo and Úrsula was surprised that Fernanda’s imagination was so limited when her 
husband ca me to the ho use looking for his daughter . It was too obvious that Meme was involved in  
secret matters, in pressing matters,  in repressed anxieties long before the night that Fernanda upset 
the house because she ca ught her kissing a man in the movies. 
Meme was  so wrapped u p in herself at tha t time that she accused Úrsula of having told on her. 
Actually, she told on herself. For a long time she had been leaving a trail that would have awakened  
the most drowsy person and it took Fernanda so l ong to discover it because she too was befogged, 
by her relationship with the invisible doctors. Even  so she finally noticed the deep silences, th e 
sudden outb ursts, the ch anges in mo od, and th e contradictio ns of her da ughter. She s et abou t on a 
disguised but implacable vigilance. She let h er go out with her  girl friends as always,  she helped  her 
get dressed for the Saturday parties, and she neve r asked an embarrassing question that might arouse 
her. She already had a great deal of proof that Me me was doin g different things from what she sai d, 
and yet she would give no indication of her sus picions, hoping for the right moment. One night 
Meme said that she was  going to the movies with her father. A short time l ater Fernand a heard the 
fireworks of the debau ch and the unm istakable accordion of Aureliano Segundo from the directio n 
of Petra Cotes’s place. Then she got dressed, wen t to the mov ie theater, an d in the darkness of the 
seats she recognized her daughter . The upsetting feeling of cer tainty s topped her from seeing the 
man she wa s kissing, but she manag ed to hear his tremulous voice in the midst of the deafening 
 139GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
shouts and la ughter of the audience. “I’m sorry, lo ve,” she heard him say, and she took Meme out of  
the place without saying a word to her, put her th rough the sh ame of parading her along the nois y 
Street of the Turks, and locked her up in her bedroom. 
On the following day at six in the afternoon, Fe rnanda recog nized the voice of the man who 
came to call  on her. He was young, sallow, with  dark and melancholy eyes which wou ld not have 
startled her s o much if sh e had known  the gypsies,  and a dream y air tha t to any wom an with a h eart 
less rigid would have been enough to make her un derstand her  daughter’s motives. He was wearing 
a shabby linen suit with shoes that sh owed the de sperate defense of superimposed patches of white 
zinc, and in his hand he was carrying a straw hat he had bought the Saturday before. In all of his life  
he could never have been as frightened as at th at moment, b ut he had a dignity and presence th at 
spared him from humiliation and a genuine elegance that was defeated only by tarnished hands and 
nails that had been shattered by rough work. Fern anda, howev er, needed o nly one look to guess his  
status of mechanic. She saw that he was wearing his one Sunday suit and that underneath his shirt h e 
bore the rash of the ban ana com pany. She woul d not let hi m speak. Sh e would no t even let hi m 
come through the door, which a moment later she had to close because the house was filled with 
yellow butter flies. 
“Go away,” she told him. “You’ve got  no reason to come calling on any decent person.” 
His name was Mauricio Babilonia. He had been  born and rai sed in Macondo, and he was an 
apprentice mechanic in the banana company ga rage. Meme had met him by chance one afternoon 
when she went with Patricia Brown to get a ca r to take a drive through the groves. Since the 
chauffeur wa s sick they as signed him to take them  and Meme was finally abl e to satisfy her desire to 
sit next to the driver and see what he did. Unlike  the regular ch auffeur, Mauricio Babilon ia gave her 
a practical lesson. That was during the time th at Meme was beginning to frequent M r. Brown’s 
house and it was still considered improper for a lady  to driv e a car. So she was satisfied with the 
technical information and she did not see Mauricio Babilonia again for several months. Later on she 
would remember that du ring the drive her attenti on had been  called to his  masculine b eauty, excep t 
for the coar seness of his  hands, but that afterwar d she had  mentioned to Pa tricia Brown that she 
had been bothered by hi s rather proud sense of security. The first Saturday tha t she went to  the 
movies with her father she saw Mauricio Babilonia ag ain, with his linen suit, sitting a few seats away  
from them, and she noti ced that h e was not payi ng much attention to th e film in order to turn 
around and l ook at her. Meme was  bothered by th e vulgarity of that. Afterward Mauricio Babilonia 
came over to say hello to Aureliano Segundo and only then did Meme find out that they knew ea ch 
other becaus e he had wo rked in Aureliano Triste’s early power  plant and h e treated h er father with  
the air of an employee.  That fact relieved the dislik e that his pr ide had caus ed in her. Th ey had  never  
been alone together nor had they spo ken except i n way of greeting, the night when she dreamed tha t 
he was savin g her from a shipwreck and she did not f eel gratitude but rage. It was as if she had given 
him the opportunity he was waitin g for, since Meme yearned  for just the opposite, not only with 
Mauricio Ba bilonia but with any other man who was interested in her. Therefore she was so  
indignant after the drea m that instead of hating him,  she felt an irresistible urge to see him. The 
anxiety beca me more intense during the course of the week an d on Saturday it was so p ressing that 
she had to make a great effort for Mauricio Babil onia not to notice tha t when he greeted her in the 
movies her heart was in h er mouth. D azed b y a co nfused feeling of pleasure and rage, she gave hi m 
her hand for the first time and onl y then did Mauricio Babilonia let h imself shake hers. Mem e 
managed to repent her impulse in a fraction of a second but the repentan ce changed i mmediately 
into a cruel satisfaction on seeing that his hand too was sweaty and cold. That night she realized that 
she would not have a moment of rest until she showed Mauricio Babilon ia the uselessness of his 
aspiration an d she spent the week turning that anxiety abou t in her mind. She resorted to  all kinds of 
useless tricks so that Patricia Brown would go g et the car with her. Finally she made use of the 
 140GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
American redhead who  was spendin g his vacatio n in Macond o at that tim e and with the pretext of 
learning about new models of cars she had him take her to the garage. From the moment she sa w 
him Meme l et herself be deceived by herself and be lieved that what was rea lly going on was tha t she 
could not bear the desire to be alone with Mauric io Babilonia, and she was made indignant by the 
certainty that he understo od that wh en he saw her a rrive. 
“I came to s ee the n ew models,” Meme said.  
“That’s a fin e excuse,” he said. 
Meme realized tha t he was burning in the heat of  his pride, and she desp erately looked  for a wa y 
to humiliate him. But he would not give her any ti me. “Don’t get upset,” he said to her  in a low 
voice. “It’s not the first time that a wo man has gone  crazy over a man.” She felt so defeated that she 
left the garage without seeing the new models and she spent the night turning over in bed and  
weeping with indignation. The Amer ican redhead , who was really beginning to interest her, looked  
like a baby in diapers. It was then that she realized that the yellow butterflies preceded th e 
appearances of Mauricio Babilonia. She had seen them before, especially over the garage, and she 
had thought that th ey were drawn b y the smell of paint. Once she had s een them flu ttering about 
her head before she went into the mo vies. But when Mauricio Babilonia began to pursue her like a  
ghost that o nly she could identify in the crowd, sh e understood  that the bu tterflies had something to  
do with him. Mauricio Babilonia was always in th e audience at the concerts, at the movi es, at high  
mass, and she did not hav e to see him to know that  he was th ere, because th e butterflies were always  
there. Once Aureliano Segundo beca me so impa tient with the suffocating fluttering that she felt th e 
impulse to confide her secret to him as she had p romised, but instinct told  her that he would laugh 
as usual and  say: “What would your mother say if she found out?” One morning, wh ile she was 
pruning the roses, Fernanda let out a  cry of frig ht and had Meme taken  away from the spot wher e 
she was, wh ich was the same pla ce in the gard en where R emedios th e Beauty had  gone up to 
heaven. She had thought for an instan t that the miracle was  going to be rep eated with h er daughter,  
because she had been bo thered by a  sudden flappi ng of wings. It was th e butterflies. Meme saw 
them as if they had suddenly been bo rn out of the light and he r heart gave a turn. At that moment 
Mauricio Babilonia came in with a package that according to what he said, was a present from  
Patricia Brown. Meme s wallowed her blush, absorb ed her tri bulation, an d even ma naged a natura l 
smile as she asked him the favor of le aving it on the railing because her hands were dirty from the 
garden. The only thing that Fernanda noted in th e man whom a few month s later she was to expel 
from the house without r emembering where she ha d seen him was the bilious texture of his skin. 
“He’s a very strange man,” Fernanda said. “You can see in his face tha t he’s going to die.” 
Meme thou ght that her  mother h ad been  imp ressed by the butterflie s When they finished 
pruning the row bushes she washed her hands and took the package to her bedroom to open it. It 
was a kind of Chinese toy, made up of five concentric boxes,  and in the last one ther e was a card 
laboriously inscribed by s omeone who could barely write: We’ll get together Saturday at the movies . Meme 
felt with an aftershock that th e box had been on the railing for a long time within reach of 
Fernanda’s curiosity, and although she was flat tered by the audacity an d ingenuity of Mauricio 
Babilonia, she was moved  by his Inno cence in exp ecting that s he would keep  the date. Meme knew 
at that time that Aureliano Segundo had an appoint ment on Saturday night. Nevertheless , the fire of 
anxiety burned her so mu ch during the course of the week th at on Saturday she convinced her father 
to leave her alone in the theater an d come back for her after the show. A nocturnal butterfly 
fluttered abo ut her head while the lights were on.  And then i t happened.  When the lights wen t out, 
Mauricio Babilonia sat down beside her. Meme f elt herself s plashing in a bog of hesitation from 
which she could only be rescued, as had occurred in  her dreams, by that man smelling of greas e 
whom she could barely see in the sha dows. 
“If you hadn’t come,” he said, “You  never would have seen me again.” 
 141GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Meme felt the weight of his hand  on her knee an d she knew that th ey wer e both  arriving at th e 
other side of abandonment at that ins tant. 
“What shocks me about you,” she said, smilin g, “is that you always say exactly what you 
shouldn’t be saying.” 
She lost her mind over him. She could  not sleep an d she lost her appetite an d sank so deeply into  
solitude that even her father beca me an annoyance. She worked out an  intricate web of false dates to 
throw Fernanda off the track, lost sight of her girl  friends, leaped over conventions  to be with 
Mauricio Babilonia at any time and at any place. At first his crudeness bothered her. The first time 
that they wer e alone on the deserted fields behind the garage he pulled her me rcilessly into an animal 
state tha t left her exhausted. It took her time to re alize that it was also a form of tenderness and it 
was th en th at she lost her  calm and liv ed only for h im, upset b y the desire to sink into his stupefying 
odor of grease washed  off by lye. A s hort time before the dea th of Amaran ta she suddenly stumbled  
into in open  space of lucidity within  the madn ess and she tr embled befo re the uncer tainty of the 
future. Then she heard about a wom an who mad e predictions from cards and went to  see her in 
secret. It wa s Pilar Ternera. As soon  as Pilar saw her com e in she was  aware of Meme’s hidden 
motives. “Sit down,” she told her. “I don’t need cards to tell the future of a Buendía,” Meme did not 
know and n ever would that the centenarian witch  was her great-grandmother. Nor would she have 
believed it after the aggressive realism with which she revealed  to her that the anxiety of fallin g in 
love could not find repose except in b ed. It was th e same point of view as Mauricio Babilonia’s, but  
Meme resisted believing it becaus e underneath it a ll she imagined that it had been inspired by the 
poor judgment of a mechanic. She thought then th at love on one side was defeating love on the 
other, becau se it was cha racteristic of men to den y hunger once their appetites were sa tisfied. Pilar 
Ternera not only cleared up that m istake, she also offered the old cano pied bed wh ere she had 
conceived Arcadio, Meme’s grandfather, and where afterward she concei ved Aureliano José. She 
also taught her how to avoid an unwanted con ception by means of the evaporation of mustard 
plasters and gave her recipes for potions that in cases of trouble could expel “even the remorse of 
conscience.”  That interview instilled In Meme the same feeling of bravery  that she had felt on the 
drunken evening. Amaranta’s death, however, oblig ed her to postpone the decision. While the ni ne 
nights lasted she did not once leave the side of Ma uricio Babilonia, who mingled with the crowd that 
invaded the house. Then came the long period of mourning and the obligatory withdrawal and they 
separated for a time. Those were da ys of such inne r agitation, such irrepressible anxiety, and so 
many repres sed urges that on th e first evening th at Meme wa s able to get out she went straight to 
Pilar Ternera’s. She surrendered to Mauricio Babil onia, without resistance, without shyn ess, without 
formalities, and with a vocation tha t was so fluid and an intuition that was so wise that a mo re 
suspicious man than hers would have confused th em with obvious experience. They made lov e 
twice a week for more than three months, pro tected  by th e innocent complicity o f Aureliano 
Segundo, who believed without suspicion in his daughter’s alibis simply in order to set her free from  
her mother’s rigidity. 
On the night that Fernanda surprised them in the movies Aureliano Segundo felt weighted down  
by the burden of his conscience and  he visited Meme in the bedroom where Fernanda kept her 
locked up, trusting that she would reveal to him  the confidences that sh e owed him.  But Meme 
denied everything. She was so sure of herself, so  anchored in her solitude that Aureli ano Segundo 
had the imp ression that no link existed between them anymore, that the comrades hip and th e 
complicity were nothing but an illusion of the pa st. He thought of speaking to Mauricio Babilonia, 
thinking that his authority as his former boss woul d make him desist from hi s plans, but Petra Cotes 
convinced hi m that it was  a woman’s business, so he was left fl oating in a limbo of indecision, barel y 
sustained by the hope that the confinement woul d put an end to his daughter’s troubles. 
 142GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Meme showed no signs of affliction. On the con trary, from the next roo m Úrsula perceived the 
peaceful rhythm of her sl eep, the serenity of her ta sks, the ord er of her meal s, and the good health 
of her digest ion. The only thing that i ntrigued Úrs ula after almost two months of punishment was  
that Meme d id not take a  bath in the morning like everyone els e, but at sev en in the evening. Once 
she thought of warning her about the scorpions, but Meme wa s so distant, convinced th at she had  
given her a way, that she preferred not to distur b her with the impertinences, of a great-great-
grandmother. The yellow butterflies would invade the h ouse at dusk. Every night on her way b ack 
from her bat h Meme would find a de sperate Fern anda killing butterflies with an insecticide bomb.  
“This is terrible,” she wo uld say, “All my life they to ld me tha t butterflies at night bring bad luck.” 
One night while Meme was in the ba throom, Fernanda wen t into her bedro om by chan ce and there 
were so m any butterflies that she coul d scarcely br eathe. She grabbed for th e nearest piece of cloth 
to shoo them away and her heart froze with terror as she connected her daughter’s evening bath s 
with the mu stard plaster s that rolled onto the floor. She did not wait for an opportune moment as  
she had the first time. On the following day she invited the new mayor to  lunch. Like her, he had  
come down from the highlands, and she asked him to station  a guard in the backyard because sh e 
had the impression that hens were being stolen. That night the guard brought down Maurici o 
Babilonia as he was lifting up the tiles to get into  the bathroo m where Meme was wai ting for him, 
naked and tr embling with love amon g the scorpions and butterflies as she had done al most every 
night for the past few m onths. A bullet lodged in his spinal column reduced him to hi s bed for the 
rest of his life. He died of old age in solitude, without a moan , without a protest, with out a single 
moment of betrayal, tor mented by memories an d by the yell ow butterflies, who did not give him a 
moment’s peace, and ostr acized as a chicken thief.

Chapter 15 
THE EVENTS that would deal Macondo its fatal blow were just showing themselves  when they 
brought Meme Buendía’ s son home.  The public si tuation wa s so uncertai n then th at no one had  
sufficient spirit to become involved with private scandals, so that Fernanda was able to count on an 
atmosphere that enabled her to keep the child hidden as if he had never existed. She had to take him 
in because the circumsta nces under which they b rought him made rejection impossible. She had to 
tolerate him against her will for the rest of her lif e because at the moment of truth sh e lacked the 
courage to go through with her inner determinati on to drown him in th e bathroom cistern. She 
locked him up in Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s ol d workshop. She succeeded in convincing Santa 
Sofía de la Piedad that she had found him floa ting in a basket. Úrsula would die without ever  
knowing his origin. Little Amaran ta Úrsula, who w ent into the workshop once when Fernanda was  
feeding the child, also believed the ver sion of the floating basket. Aureliano Segundo, having broke n 
finally with his wife because of the irrational wa y in which she handled Meme’s tragedy, did not 
know of the existence of his grandson until three ye ars after th ey brought hi m home, wh en the child 
escaped from captivity through an oversight on Fe rnanda’s part and appeared on the porch for a 
fraction of a second, naked, with matted hair, an d with an impressive sex organ that was like a 
turkey’s wattles, as if he were not a h uman ch ild but the en cyclopedia definition of a can nibal. 
Fernanda had not counted on that nasty trick of  her incorrigible fate. The child was  like the 
return of a s hame that she had thought exiled by he r from the house forever. As soon as  they carried  
off Mauricio Babilonia with his shatter ed spinal column, Fernanda had worked out the m ost minute 
details of a p lan destined  to wipe out all traces of the burden. Without con sulting her husband, she 
packed her bags, put the three ch anges of clothi ng that her daughter would need  into a smal l 
suitcase, and went to get h er in her bedroom a half hour before the train arrived. 
“Let’s go, Renata,” she tol d her. 
She gave no explanation. Meme, for her part, di d not expect or want any.  She not only did no t 
know where they were go ing, but it would have been the sam e to her if they had been ta king her to 
the slaughter house. She had not spoken again nor would she do so for the rest of her life from the 
time that sh e heard the shot in the backyard a nd the simultaneous cry of pain from Mauricio 
Babilonia. When her mother ordere d her out of the bedroom  she did not comb her hair or wash her  
face and sh e got into th e train as if she were wa lking in her sleep, not even noticing the yellow 
butterflies that were still accompan ying her. Fernanda never found out nor did she take the trouble 
to, whether that stony silence was a determination of her will or whether  she had become mute 
because of the impact of  the tragedy.  Meme barely  took notice of the journey through the formerly 
enchanted region. She did not see the shady, endless banana groves on both sides of the tracks. She 
did not see the white h ouses of the gringos or thei r gardens, dried out by dust and heat, or the 
women in sh orts and blue-striped shirts playing cards on the ter races. She di d not see the oxcarts on  
the dusty ro ads loaded d own with  bunches of b ananas. She did not see the girls diving into the 
transparent rivers like t arpons, leaving the pass engers on the train with the bitterness of thei r 
splendid breasts, or the miserable huts of the wo rkers all huddled together where Mauricio Babilo-
nia’s yellow butterflies fluttered abou t and in th e doorways of which there were green and squalid  
children sitting on their pots, and pregnant wom en who shouted insults at the train. That fleeting  
vision, which had been a celebration for her wh en she came home from school, pas sed through 
Meme’s heart without a quiver. She did not look out of the window, not even when the burning 
dampness of the groves ended and the train went through a poppy-laden plain where the carbonized  
 144GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
skeleton of the Spanish g alleon still sa t and then came out into the dear  air alongside the f rothy, dirty 
sea where al most a cen tury before José Arcadio Bu endía’s illusions had met defeat. 
At five o’clock in the afternoon, when they had come to the l ast station in the swamp,  she got 
out of the train because Fernanda made her. They got into a small carriage that looked like an 
enormous bat, drawn by an asthmati c horse, and they wen t through the desolate city in  the endless  
streets of which, split by saltiness, there was th e sound of a piano lesson just like the one that  
Fernanda heard during the siestas  of her adolesce nce. They went on b oard a riverboat, the wood en 
wheel of which had a sound of conflagration, and whose rusted metal  plates reverberated like th e 
mouth of an oven. Meme shut herself up in her cabi n. Twice a day Fernan da left a plate of food by  
her bed and twice a da y she took it away intact, not because Meme had resolved to die of hunger,  
but becaus e even the sm ell of food was repugnan t to her and her stomach  rejected even water. No t 
even she herself knew that her fertility had outwitted  the mustard vapors, just as Fernanda did not  
know until almost a year later, when they brought the child. In the suffocating cabin, maddened by 
the vibration of the meta l plates and the unbeara ble stench o f the mud stirred up by the paddl e 
wheel, Mem e lost track of the days. Much time had passed when she sa w the last yellow butterfly 
destroyed in the blades of the fan and she admitted  as an irremediable truth that Mauricio Babilonia  
had died. She did not let herself be defeated by resignation, however. She kept on thinking about  
him during the arduous muleback cr ossing of th e hallucinati ng plateau where Aureli ano Segundo 
had become lost when he was looking for the mo st beautiful woman who had ever appeared on the 
face of the earth, and wh en they wen t over the mo untains alon g Indian trails and entered the gloomy 
city in wh ose stone alleys the funereal bronze b ells of thirty-two churches  tolled. That night they 
slept in the abandoned colonial mansion on board s that Fernanda laid on the floor of a room 
invaded by weeds, wrapped in the shreds of curtains that they pulled off the windows and that fell to  
pieces with every turn of the body. Meme knew  where they were because in the flight of her  
insomnia she saw pass by the gentleman dressed in black who m they delivered to  the ho use inside a  
lead box on one distant Christmas Eve. On the follo wing day, after mass, Fernanda took her to a  
somber building that Meme recognized immediatel y from her mother’s stories of the convent wher e 
they h ad rais ed her to  be a queen,  and then sh e understood th at they had  come to th e end of th e 
journey. While Fernanda was speakin g to someon e in the office next doo r, Meme remained in a 
parlor checkered with large oil paintin gs of coloni al archbishops, still wearin g an etamine dress with 
small black flowers and s tiff high shoes which were swollen by the cold o f the uplands. She was  
standing in the center of the parlor thinking about Mauricio Babilonia under the yello w stream of  
light from the stained glass windows when a very  beautiful novice came out of the office carryin g 
her suitcase with the thr ee ch anges of clothing. As she p assed Meme sh e took her h and without 
stopping. 
“Come, Renata,” she said to her. 
Meme took  her hand and let hersel f be led. The l ast tim e that Fernanda sa w her, trying  to keep 
up with the novice, the iron grating o f the cloister  had just closed behind her. She was still thinking 
about Mauricio Babilonia, his smell of grease, an d his halo o f butterflies, and she wo uld keep o n 
thinking about him for all the da ys of her life until the remote a utumn morn ing when she died of old 
age, with her name chan ged and her head shaved and witho ut ever having spoken a word, in a  
gloomy hospital in Cracow. 
Fernanda returned to Ma condo on a  train protected by armed  police. During the trip s he noticed  
the tension of the passengers, the military prep arations in the towns along the line, and an 
atmosphere rarified by the certain ty that som ething serious was going to happen, but she had no 
information until she reached Macon do and they to ld her that José Arcad io Segundo was inciting 
the workers of the banan a company to strike. “Tha t’s all we n eed,” Fernanda said to herself. “An 
anarchist in the family.” The strike broke out two weeks later and it did not have the dramatic 
 145GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
consequences that had been feared. The workers demanded tha t they not be obliged to cut and load  
bananas on Sundays, and the position seemed so j ust that even  Father Anto nio Isabel interceded i n 
its favor because he fou nd it in acco rdance with the laws of God. That v ictory, along with other  
actions that were initiated during the following months, drew the colorless José Arcadio Segundo 
out of his an onymity, for people had been accustomed  to say that he was only good fo r fillin g up the 
town with F rench whores. With the same impulsive decision with which he had aucti oned off his 
fighting cocks in order to organize a harebrained boat business, he gave up his position as foreman 
in the banana company and took the side of th e workers. Quite soon he was pointed  out as the 
agent of an international  conspiracy against public order. One night, during the course of a week 
darkened by somber rumors, he miraculously esca ped four revolver shots taken at him by an 
unknown party as he was leaving a secret meeting.  The atmosphere of the following months was s o 
tense tha t even Úrsula perceived it in her dark corner, and she had the im pression that once more 
she was living through the dangerous times when he r son Aureliano carried the homeopathic pills of 
subversion in his pocket. She tried to speak to J osé Arcadio Segundo, to let him know about that 
precedent, b ut Aureliano Segundo told her that since the night of the attempt on his life no one 
knew his wh ereabouts. 
“Just like Aureliano,” Úrsula exclaimed. “It’s as if the world were repeating itself.” 
Fernanda, was immune to the uncertainty of those days. She had no contact with the outside 
world since the violent a ltercation sh e had had  with her husband over her  having decided Memes  
fate withou t his con sent. Aureliano Segundo was p repared to  rescue his d aughter with the help  of 
the police if necessary, b ut Fernanda showed him so me papers  that were pr oof that she had entered  
the convent of her own free will. Meme had indeed  signed once she was already behind the iron 
grating and she did it with the same indifference with which she had allowed herself to be led away. 
Underneath it all, Aureliano Segundo did not believe in the legitimacy of the proof. Just as he never 
believed that Mauricio Babilonia had gone into the yard to  steal chickens, but both expedients 
served to eas e his con science, and thu s he could go back witho ut remorse under the sha dow of Petra  
Cotes, where he revived his noisy revelry and unli mited gourmandizing. Foreign to the restlessness 
of the town,  deaf to Úrsula’s quiet predictions. Fe rnanda gave the las t tam to the screw of her  
preconceived plan. She wrote a long letter to her s on José Arcadio, who was then ab out to take his 
first orders, and in it she told him th at his sister Renata had expired in the pe ace of the Lord and as a 
consequence of the black  vomit. Then she put Amar anta Úrs ula under th e care of San ta Sofía de la  
Piedad and dedicated hers elf to organizing her correspondence with the invisible doctors, which had 
been upset by Meme’s trouble. The first thing that sh e did  was to set a definite date for the  
postponed telepathic operation. But the invisible doctors ans wered her that it was not wise so long 
as the state of social agitation continued in Macondo. She was so urgent and so poorly Informed 
that she exp lained to them In another letter th at there was  no such state of agitation and that 
everything was the result of the lunacy of a brother- in-law of hers who was fiddlin g around at that 
time in that labor union nonsense just as he had been involved with cockfighting and riverboats 
before. They were still not in agreement on the hot Wednesday when an aged nun knocked at the  
door bearing a small bask et on her arm. When she ope ned the door Santa S ofía de la Piedad thought 
that it was a  gift and tried to take the s mall bask et that was covered with a lo vely lace wra p. But th e 
nun stopped  her because she had instructions to give  it personally and with  the strictest secrecy to  
Doña Ferna nda del Car pio de Buen día. It was Me me’s son. Fernanda’s former spiritual director  
explained to  her in a letter that he ha d been born two months  before and that th ey ha d taken th e 
privilege o f baptizing him Aureliano, for h is gran dfather, because his mother would not open her  
lips to tell them her wishes. Fernanda rose up inside  against that trick of fa te, but she had sufficient 
strength to h ide it in front of the nun. 
“We’ll tell them that we f ound him flo ating in the basket,” she said smiling. 
 146GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“No one will believe it,” the nun said. 
“If they believe it in the B ible,” Fernanda replied,  “I don’t see why they sh ouldn’t believe it fro m 
me.” 
The nun lunched at the house while she waited for the train back, and in accordance with the 
discretion they asked of her, she did not mention the child again, but Fernanda viewed her as an  
undesirable witness of h er shame an d lamented the fact that they h ad abandoned th e medieva l 
custom of hanging a messenger who bore bad news. It was then that she d ecided to drown the chil d 
in the cistern  as soon  as the nun left,  but her h eart was n ot strong enough a nd she preferred to wait 
patiently unti l the infinite goodness of God would free her from the annoyance. 
The new Au reliano was a year old when the ten sion of the people broke with no forewarning. 
José Arcadio Segundo and other union leaders wh o had remai ned underground until then suddenl y 
appeared on e weekend a nd organized demonstrati ons in towns throughout the banana r egion. The 
police merel y maintained  public order. But on Monday night the leaders  were taken  from their  
homes and sent to jail in the capital of the pr ovince with two-pound irons on their legs. Taken  
among them were José Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilán,  a colonel in the Mex ican revolution, 
exiled in Macondo, who said that he had been wi tness to the h eroism of his comrade Ar temio Cruz. 
They were s et free, however, within three mon ths because of the fact th at the govern ment and  the 
banana com pany could  not reach  an agreement as  to who sho uld feed them in jail. Th e protests  of 
the workers this time were based on the lack  of sanitary facilities in  their living quarters, the 
nonexistence of medical services, and terrible work ing conditions. They stated, furthermore, that 
they were no t being paid in real money but in scrip, which was good only to buy Virginia ham in the 
company co mmissaries. José Arcadio  Segundo was put in jail because he revealed th at the s crip 
system was a way for the company to finance its fruit ships; which without the commissary 
merchandise would have to return empty from New Orlea ns to the banana ports. The other 
complaints were comm on knowledge. The company physici ans did not examine the sick but had 
them line up behind one another in the dispensari es and a nurse would put a pill the color of copper 
sulfate on th eir tongues, whether they had mal aria, g onorrhea, or constipati on. It was  a cure tha t was 
so common that children would stand in line several times and instead of s wallowing the pills would  
take them ho me to use as bingo markers. The co mpany workers were crowded together in miserable 
barracks. The engineers, instead of putting in to ilets, had a portable latrine for every fifty people 
brought to the ca mps a t Christmas ti me and  they he ld public d emonstrations of how to use them so 
that th ey would last longer. The decrepit lawyer s dressed in black who during other times had  
besieged Colonel Aureliano Buendí a and who now  were controlled by the banana company 
dismissed th ose demands  with d ecisions that seem ed like acts of magic. When the wor kers drew up  
a list of unan imous petitio ns, a long ti me passed  before they were able to n otify the ban ana co mpany  
officially. As soon as he found out about the agr eement Mr. Brown hitched  his luxurious glassed-in 
coach to  the train and disappeared  from Macondo along with th e more prom inent representatives of  
his company. Nonetheles s some workers found one of  them the following Saturday in a brothel and 
they mad e him sign a copy of the sheet with the d emands while he was naked with the women who  
had helped to entrap him . The mourn ful lawyers s howed in co urt that that man had n othing to do 
with the co mpany and in order that no one doubt their arguments they had him jailed as an 
impostor. La ter on, Mr. Brown was surprised tra veling incognito, in a third-class coach and they 
made him sign another copy of the demands. On the following day he appeared before the judges 
with his hair dyed black and speaking flawless Spanish. The lawyers showed that th e man was not 
Mr. Jack Brown, the superintendent of the bana na company, born in Pr attville Alabama, but a 
harmless vendor of me dicinal plants, born in Ma condo and baptized there with the name of  
Dagoberto Fonseca. A while later, faced with  a new attemp t by the wor kers the lawyers publicly 
exhibited Mr. Brown’s death certifica te, attes ted to by consuls and foreign ministers which bor e 
 147GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
witness that on June ninth last he had been run ov er by a fire engine in Chicago. Tired of that 
hermeneutical delirium, the workers turned away f rom the auth orities in Macondo and b rought their 
complaints u p to the higher courts. I t was ther e that the sl eight-of-hand lawyers prov ed tha t the 
demands lacked all validity for the simple reason that the banana company did not have, never had  
had, and never would have any workers in its service because th ey were all hired on a temporary and 
occasional basis. So that the fable of the Virg inia ham was nonsense, the same as that of the 
miraculous p ills and the Yuletide toilets, and by a decision of the court it was established and set 
down in solemn decrees that the workers did not exist. 
The great strike broke out. Cultivation stopped halfway, the fruit rotted on the trees and th e 
hundred-twenty-car trains remained on the sidings.  The idle workers overflowed the towns. The 
Street of th e Turks echo ed with a Sa turday tha t lasted for sev eral days an d in the poo lroom at th e 
Hotel Jacob they had  to arrange twenty-four-hour sh ifts. That was where José Arcadio Segundo was  
on the day it was announced that th e army had been assigned to reestablish public order. Although 
he was not a  man given to omens, th e news was like an anno uncement of de ath that he had been 
waiting for ever since tha t distant mo rning wh en Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had l et him see an 
execution. T he bad o men did not ch ange his solemn ity, however. He took  the shot he had planned 
and it was g ood. A short time later the drumbeats,  the shrill of the bugle, the shouting and running 
of the people told him that not only had the game of  pool come to an end, but also the silent and  
solitary game that he ha d been playi ng with hims elf ever since tha t dawn  execution. Then he wen t 
out into th e street and  saw them. Th ere were three re giments, whose march in time to  a galley drum 
made the earth tremble. Their snorting of a ma ny-headed dragon filled the glow of noon with a 
pestilential vapor. They were short, stocky, and brute like. They perspired with the sweat of a horse 
and had a  smell of sunta nned hide an d the tacitur n and impen etrable persev erance of men from th e 
uplands. Although it took them over an hour to  pass by, one might have thought that they were onl y 
a few squads marching in a circle, because they were all identical, sons of the same bitch, and with 
the sam e stolidity they all bore the weight of their packs and ca nteens, th e shame of th eir rifles with  
fixed bayonets, and the chancre of bli nd obedien ce and a sens e of honor. Úrsula heard them pass  
from her be d in the shadows and she made a crow wi th her fingers. Santa Sofí a de la Pie dad existed  
for an instan t, leaning ov er the embro idered tablecl oth that she had just ironed, and she thought of 
her son, José Arcadio Seg undo, who without changi ng expression watch ed the last sol diers pass by 
the door of the Hotel Jacob. 
Martial law enabled the army to assu me the func tions of arbitrator in the controversy, but no 
effort at conciliation was made. As  soon as they appeared in Macond o, the soldiers put aside their  
rifles and cut and loaded  the bananas  and started  the trains running. The workers, who had been  
content to wait until then, went into the woods with no other weapons but their working machetes  
and they beg an to s abotage the s abotage. They bu rned plantati ons and co mmissaries, tore up track s 
to impede th e passage of the trains tha t began to o pen their path with machi ne-gun fire, and they cu t 
telegraph and telephone wires. The irrigation ditc hes were stained with blood. Mr. Brown, who was  
alive in the electrified ch icken coop, was taken  out of Macon do with his family and those of his 
fellow countrymen and brought to a safe place un der the protection of the army. The situation was  
threatening to lead to a b loody and u nequal civil war when th e authorities  called upon  the workers  
to gather in Macondo. The summons announced th at the civil and military leader of the province 
would arrive on the following Friday ready to intercede in the conflict. 
José Arcadio  Segundo wa s in the cro wd tha t had gathered at the sta tion o n Friday since early in 
the morning. He had tak en part in a meeting of  union leaders and had been commissioned, along  
with Colonel Gavilán, to mingle in the crowd and orient it according to how things went. He did not 
feel well and  a salty pas te was b eginning to collect on his pala te when  he n oticed th at the army had 
set up machine-gun emplacements around the small square and that the wired city of the banana 
 148GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
company was protected by artillery pieces. Around twel ve o’clock, waiting for a train t hat was not 
arriving, mo re than three thousand people, workers, women, and childre n, had spille d out of the 
open space in front of t he station and were pressi ng into th e neighboring streets, wh ich the army  
had closed off with rows of machine guns. At that ti me it all se emed more like a jubilant  fair than a 
waiting crowd. They had brought over the fritter an d drink stands from the Street of the Turks and  
the peopl e were in goo d spirits as they bore the tedium of waiting and the scorchin g sun. A sho rt 
time before three o’clock the rumor sp read that the official train would not a rrive until the following 
day. The crowd let out a sigh of disappointment. An army lieu tenant then climbed up onto the roo f 
of the statio n where th ere were four machine-gun emplacements aiming at the crowd a nd called for 
silence. Next to José Arcadio Segundo there was a barefooted  woman, ver y fat, with two children 
between the ages of four and seven. She was car rying the sm aller one an d she asked José Arcadio  
Segundo, without knowing him, if he would lift up the other o ne so that h e could hear  better. José 
Arcadio Seg undo put the child on his shoulders. Many  years later that child would still tell, to the 
disbelief of all, that he had seen the lieutenant rea ding Decree No. 4 of the civil and military leader  
of the province through an old phonograph horn. It  had be en signed by General Carlos Cortes 
Vargas and his secretary, Major Enrique García Is aza, and in three articles of eighty words he 
declared the strikers to be a “bunch of hoodlums ” and he authorized the ar my to shoot to kill. 
After the decree was read, in the midst of a deafen ing hoot of protest, a captain took the place of  
the lieuten ant on th e roof of the sta tion and with  the horn he s ignaled that he wanted to  speak. The 
crowd was q uiet again. 
“Ladies and gentlemen,” the captain s aid in a low vo ice that was slow and a little tired. “you have 
five minutes to withdraw. ” 
The redoubled hooting and shouting drowned out th e bugle call that annou nced the star t of the 
count. No o ne moved. 
Five minutes have passed ,” the captai n said in  the same ton e. “One more minute and we’ll open  
fire.” 
José Arcadi o Segundo, sweating ice,  lowered the child and gave him to  the wo man. “Those 
bastards might just shoot,” she murmured. José Arcadio Segundo did not have ti me to speak 
because at th at instan t he recognized the hoarse voice of Colonel Gavilán echoing the words of the 
woman with  a shout. Intoxicated by the tension , by the miraculous depth of the silence, and  
furthermore convinced that nothing could move that  crowd h eld tight in a fascination with death, 
José Arcadio Segundo raised himself up over the he ads in front of him and for the first time in his  
life he raised his voice. 
“You bastards!” he shouted. “Take the extra minute and stick it up your ass!” 
After his shout something happened that did not br ing on fright but a kind of hallucination. The 
captain gave the order to  fire and fourteen machin e guns answered at once. But it all seemed like a  
farce. It was as if the machine guns had been load ed with caps, because their  panting rattle could be 
heard and their incandescent spitting could be seen , but not the slightest reaction was perceived, not 
a cry, not even a sigh among the compact cro wd that s eemed petrified by an ins tantaneous  
invulnerabilit y. Suddenly, on one sid e-of the station, a cry o f death tore open the enchantment:  
“Aaaagh, Mother.” A seis mic voice, a volcanic brea th. the roar o f a cataclysm  broke out in  the center  
of the crowd with a great potential of expansion. José Arcadio Segundo barely  had time to pick up  
the child while the mother with the other one was swallowed up by the crowd that swirled about i n 
panic. 
Many years later that child would still tell, in spi te of people thinking that he was a crazy old man, 
how José Ar cadio Segundo had lifted him over his he ad an d hauled him, almost in  the air, as i f 
floating on the terror of the crowd, toward a nea rby street. T he child’s privileged position allowed  
 149GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
him to see a t that mom ent that th e wild mass was starting to get to the corner and the row of 
machine guns opened fire. Several voices shouted at the same time: 
“Get down! Get down!” 
The people in front had  already done so, swept down by th e wave of b ullets. The s urvivors, 
instead of getting down, tried to go back to the small square, and the panic became a drag on’s tail as 
one compact wave ran against another which wa s moving in the oppos ite direction, toward the 
other dragon’s tail In th e street acro ss the wa y, wh ere the m achine guns were also firing without 
cease. They were Penned in. swirling about in a giga ntic whirlwind that little by little was being 
reduced to its epicenter a s the edges were system atically being cut off all around like an onion being 
peeled by the insatiable and metho dical shears of the machine guns. The child saw a wom an 
kneeling with her arms i n the sh ape of a cross in  an open  space, mysteriously free of the stamp ede. 
José Arcadio  Segundo put him up there at the mo ment  he fell with his face bathed in bl ood, before 
the colossal troop wiped  out the em pty space, the kneeling woman, the li ght of the high, drought -
stricken sky, and the who rish world where Úrsula Iguarán had sold so many little candy a nimals. 
When José Arcadio Segundo came to he was lying face up in the darkness. He realized that he 
was riding on an endless and silent train and that his head was caked with dry blood and that all his 
bones ached.  He felt an intolerable desire to sleep . Prepared to sleep for m any hours, safe from the  
terror and the horror, he made himsel f comfortable on the side that pained him less, and only then 
did he discover that he was lying against dead people. There was no free space in the car except fo r 
an aisle in the middle. Several hours must have  passed since the massacre because the corpses ha d 
the same temperature as  a plaster in autumn and the same co nsistency of petrified foam that it had, 
and those who had put them in the car had had ti me to pile th em up in the same wa y in which th ey 
transported bunches of bananas. Trying to flee fr om the nightmare, José Arcadio Segundo dragged  
himself from one car to a n other in th e direction i n which th e train was heading, and in the flash es 
of light that broke through the wooden slats as  they went through sleeping towns he saw the ma n 
corpses, woman corpses, child corpses who would be thrown into the sea li ke rejected b ananas. He 
recognized only a woman who sold drinks  in the square and Colonel Gavilán, who still held  
wrapped in his hand the belt with a buckle of More lia silver wit h which he had tried to open his way 
through the panic. When he got to the first car he jumped into the darkness and lay beside the tracks 
until the train had passed. It was the longest one he  had ever seen, with almost two hundred freight 
cars and a locomotive at either end a nd a third one  in the middle. It had no lights, not even the red 
and green running lights, and it slipped off with a no cturnal an d stealthy vel ocity. On to p of the cars 
there could be seen th e dark shapes of the soldiers with their emplaced ma chine guns. 
After midnight a torrentia l cloudburst came up. José Arcadio Segundo did not know where it was  
that h e had j umped off, but he knew that b y goin g in the opp osite directio n to th at of the train h e 
would reach Macondo. After walking for more than three hour s, soaked to the skin, with a terrible 
headache, h e was able to  make out the first houses in the light of dawn. Attracted by the smell of  
coffee, he went into a kitchen where a  woman with  a child in her arms was leaning over the stove. 
“Hello,” he s aid, exhausted. “I’m  José Arcadio Segundo Buendía.” 
He pronounced his whole name, letter by letter, in order to convince her that he was alive. He 
was wise in doing so, because th e woman had tho ught that he was an app arition as she s aw the dirty,  
shadowy figure with his head and clo thing dirty wi th blood and touched wi th the solem nity of death 
come through the door. She recognized him. She brought him a blanket so that he could wrap 
himself up while his cloth es dried by the fire, she warmed som e water to  wash his woun d, which was  
only a flesh wound, and she gave him a clean diap er to bandage his head. Then she gave him a mug 
of coffee without sugar as she had been told the Buendías drank it, and she spread his clothing out 
near the fire. 
José Arcadio Segundo did not speak u ntil he had finished drinking his coffee . 
 150GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“There must have been three thousan d of them” he murmured. 
“What?” 
“The dead,” he clarified. “It must have b een an of the people w ho were at th e station.” 
The wom an measured  him with a pi tying look. “T here haven’t been any dead here,” she said. 
“Since the ti me of your u ncle, the col onel, nothin g has happen ed in Macon do.” In the three kitchen s 
where José Arcadio Seg undo stopped before reachi ng home they told hi m the same thing. “There 
weren’t any dead. He went through the small squ are by  the station and h e saw the fritter stands piled 
one on top of the other and he could find no trace of the massacre. The streets were deserted under 
the persisten t rain and th e houses locked up with no trace of li fe inside. The only huma n note wa s 
the first tolling of the bells for mass. He knocked at the door at Colonel Gavilán’s house. A pregnant 
wom an whom he had s een several ti mes closed the door in his face. “He left,” she said, frightened.  
“He went back to his  own country.” The main en trance to the wire chic ken coop was guarded as  
always by two local pol icemen who  looked as if  they were made of sto ne under th e rain, with  
raincoats an d rubber boots. On their marginal str eet the West Indian Negroes were singing Saturday 
psalms. José Arcadio Segundo jumped over the courtyard wall and entered the house through the 
kitchen. San ta Sofía de l a Piedad bar ely raised her voice. “Don’t let Ferna nda see you, ” she said. 
“She’s just getting up.” As if she were fulfill ing an implicit pact, sh e took her  son to the 
“chamberpot room.” arranged Melquíades’ broken -down cot for him and at two in the afternoon,  
while Fernanda was takin g her siesta, she passed a plate of food in to him th rough the window. 
Aureliano Segundo had s lept at home because the ra in had ca ught him ti me and at th ree in the 
afternoon he was still waiting for it to clear. Inform ed in secret by Santa Sofía de la Piedad, he 
visited his brother in Melquíades’ room at that ti me. He did not believe the version of the massacre 
or the nightmare trip of  the train lo aded with  corpses traveling toward the sea  either. The night 
before he had read an extraordinary proclamation to  the n ation which said that th e work ers had left 
the station a nd had returned home in peaceful groups. The proclama tion also stated th at the union 
leaders, with great patriotic spirit, had reduced their demands to two points: a reform of medical 
services and the building of latrines in  the living q uarters. It was stated later that when the military 
authorities o btained the agreement with the work ers, they has tened to tell  Mr. Brown and he not 
only accepted the new conditions but offered to pay for three days of public festivities to celebrate 
the end  of the conflict. Except th at when the mi litary asked him on what date they could announce 
the signing of the agreement, he looked out the wi ndow at the sky crossed with lightning flashes and 
made a profound gesture of doubt. 
“When the rain stops,” he said. “As long as th e rain lasts we’re suspending all activities.” 
It had not rained for three month s and there had been a drought. But when Mr. Brown 
announced his decision a torrential downpour spread over the whole banana region. It was the one 
that caught José Arcadio Segundo o n his way to  Macondo. A week later  it was still raining. The  
official version, repeated  a thousand times and ma ngled out all over the co untry by every means of 
communicati on the government found at hand, was finally accepted: there were no dead, the 
satisfied workers had go ne back to their familie s, and the b anana company was suspending all 
activity until  the rains stopped. Martial law con tinued with  an eye to the necessity of taking 
emergency measures for the public d isaster of th e endless downpour, but the troops were confined  
to quarters. During the day the soldi ers walked th rough the torrents in the streets wi th their pant 
legs rolled up, playing with boats with the chil dren. At night a fter taps, they knocked d oors down 
with their rifle butts, hauled suspec ts out of their beds, and took th em off on trips from which there 
was no return. The search for and extermination of the hoodlums, murderers, arsonists, and rebels 
of Decree No. 4 was still going on , but the military de nied it even to the relatives of the victims who 
crowded the commandan t’s offices in search of news . “You must have been dreaming,” the officers 
 151GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
insisted. “N othing has happened in Macondo, nothi ng has ever happened, and nothing ever will 
happen. “This is a happy town.” In that way they were finally able to wipe o ut the union leaders. 
The only survivor was José Arcadio Segundo. One Fe bruary night the unmistakable blows of rifle 
butts were heard at the door. Aureliano Segundo, w ho was still waiting for it to clear, opened the 
door to six soldiers under the command of an offi cer. Soaking from the rain, without saying a word, 
they search ed the house room by room, closet by closet, from parlor to pantry. Úrsula woke up 
when they turned on the light in her room and she did not breathe while the march went on but 
held her fingers in the shape of a cross, pointin g them to wh ere the soldiers were mo ving about. 
Santa Sofía de la Piedad  managed to warn José Arcadio Segundo, who was sleeping in Melquíades’ 
room, but he could see that it was to o late to  try to  escap e. So Santa Sofía de la Pieda d locked the  
door again and he put o n his shirt and his shoes and sat down on the co t to wait for them. At that  
moment they were searching the gold workshop. Th e officer made them open the padlock and with 
a quick sweep of his lantern he saw the workbench and the glass cupboard with bottles  of acid and  
instruments that were sti ll where their owner had left them and he seemed to understand that no 
one lived in that room. He wisely asked Aureliano Segundo if h e was a silversmith, however, and th e 
latter explained to him that it had been Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s workshop. “Oho,” the officer 
said, turned on the lights,  and ordered  such a  minu te search  that they did no t miss th e eighteen little 
gold fishes that had not been melted down and th at were hidd en behind th e bottles Is their tin can. 
The officer examined th em one by o ne on the workbench an d then h e turned human.  “I’d like to  
take one, if I  may,” he s aid. “At one ti me they we re a mark of subversion, but now they’re relics.” -
He was young, almost an adolescent, with no sign  of timidity and with a  natural pleas ant mann er 
that had  not shown itself until th en. Aureliano Segundo gave him the littl e fish. The officer put it in  
his shirt pocket with a ch ildlike glow in his eyes an d he put the others back i n the can an d set it back 
where it had been. 
“It’s a wonderful memento,” he said. “Colonel Aureliano Buendía was one of our greatest men.” 
Nevertheless , that surge of humanity did not alter his professional conduct. At Melquíades’ room, 
which was locked up again with the padlock, Santa Sofía de la Piedad tried one last hope. “No one 
has lived in that room for a century,” she said. The officer had it opened a nd flashed the beam of  
the lantern o ver it, and Aureliano Segundo and Santa Sofía de la Piedad saw the Arab eyes of José 
Arcadio Segundo at th e moment wh en the ra y of lig ht passed over his face and they understood that 
it was the end of one anxiety and  the beginning  of another which would find relief only in 
resignation. But the offic er continued examining t he room with the lantern and showed no sign of 
interest until he discovered the seventy-two chambe rpots piled up in the cupboards. Then he turned  
on the light. José Arcadio Segundo was sitting on the edge of the cot,  ready to go, more solemn an d 
pensive than ever. In t he background were the shelves with the shredded books, the rolls of 
parchment, and the clean and orderl y worktable with the ink still fres h in the inkwells. There was the 
same pureness in the air, the same clar ity, the sa me respite from dust and destruction tha t Aureliano 
Segundo had known in c hildhood and that only Colonel Aureliano Buendía could not perceive. But 
the officer was only inter ested in the chamberpots.  
“How many people live in this house?’ he asked. 
“Five. ” 
The officer obviously did not understand. He paused with his glance on the space where 
Aureliano Segundo and Santa Soft de la Piedad were  still seeing José Arcadio Segundo and the latter  
also realized that the soldier was looking at him without seei ng him. Then he turned out the light 
and closed the door. When he spoke to the soldiers, Aureliano, Segundo understood that the you ng 
officer had seen the roo m with the s ame eyes as Colonel Aureliano Buendía. 
“It’s obvious that no one has been in that room fo r at least a hundred years.” the officer said to 
the soldiers. “There must even be sna kes in there.” 
 152GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
When the d oor closed, José Arcadi o Segundo was sure tha t the war was over. Yea rs before 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía had spoken to him about the fascination of war and had tried to show it  
to him with countless examples drawn from his ow n experience. He had believed him. But the night 
when the sol diers looked at him witho ut seeing hi m while he thought about the tension  of the past 
few months, the misery of jail, the panic at the station, and th e trai n loaded with dead people, José 
Arcadio Segundo reached the conclu sion that Col onel Aureliano Buendía was not hing but a faker or 
an imbecile. He could not understand why he had needed so many words to explain what he felt in 
war because one was enough: fear. In Melquíad es’ room, on the other hand, protected by the 
supernatural light, by the sound of the rain, by th e feeling of being invisible, he found the repose 
that he had not had for one single instant during his previous life, and the only fear that remained 
was tha t they would bury him alive. He told San ta Sofía de la Piedad about it when sh e brought him  
his daily meals and she promised to struggle to stay  alive even beyond her na tural forces in order to 
make sure that th ey wo uld bury him dead. Free from all fear, José Ar cadio Segundo dedicated 
himself then to peruse th e manuscripts of Melquíad es many times, and with so much more pleasur e 
when he cou ld not understand them. He becam e accustom ed to the sound  of the rain, which after 
two months had become another form of silence, and the onl y thing that disturbed his solitude was  
the coming and going o f Santa Sofía de la Piedad. He asked her, therefore, to leave the meals on the 
windowsill and padlock the door. The rest of the family forgot  about him including Fernanda, who 
did not mind leaving him there when she found that  the sold iers had seen him without recognizing 
him. After six months of encl osure , since the soldiers had  left Macon do Aureliano Segundo 
removed the padlock, looking for someone he could talk to until the rain stopped. As soon as he 
opened the door he felt the pes tilenti al attack of  the cha mberpots, which were placed on the floor  
and all of which had been used  several times.  José Arcad io Segundo, devoured by baldness,  
indifferent to the air that had been sharpened by the nauseating vapors, was still reading and  
rereading the unintelligib le parchments. He was illu minated by a seraphic glow. He scarcely raised 
his eyes when he heard the door open, but that look was enough for his brother to see repeated in it  
the irreparable fate of his great-grandfather. 
“There were more than three thousan d of them,”  was all that José Arcadio Segundo said. “I’m 
sure now tha t they were everybody wh o had been a t the sta tion.”

Chapter 16 
IT RAINED FOR four years, eleven months, and two days. Th ere were perio ds of drizzle during which 
everyone put on his full dress and a co nvalescent lo ok to celebra te the clearin g, but the people soon  
grew accusto med to  inter pret the paus es as a sign of  redoubled rain. The sk y crumbled i nto a set of  
destructive s torms and out of the north came hu rricanes that scattered ro ofs about and knocked  
down walls and uprooted every last plant of the ba nana groves. Just as during the insomnia plague, 
as Úrsula came to  rem ember during those days, the cala mity itself i nspired defenses against 
boredom. Aureliano Segundo was one of those w ho worked hardest n ot to be co nquered b y 
idleness. He had gone home for some minor m atter on th e night that Mr. Brown unleashed th e 
storm, and F ernanda tried to h elp him with a hal f-blown-out umbrella tha t she found i n a clos et. “I  
don’t need it,” he said. “I’ll stay until it clears.” That was not, of course, an ironclad promise, but he 
would acco mplish it literally. Since his clothes were at Petra C otes’s, every three days h e would tak e 
off what he had on and wait in his shorts until they washed.  In order not to becom e bored, he 
dedicated  himself to the task of rep airing the m any things that needed fixing in the house. He 
adjusted hinges, oiled locks, screwed knockers tigh t, and planed doorjambs. For several months h e 
was seen  wandering about with a to olbox that the gypsies must have left behind in José Arcadi o 
Buendía’s days, and no one knew whether becaus e of the involuntary exercise, the winter tedium or 
the imposed abstinence, but his belly was deflating little by little like a wineskin and his face of a 
beatific tortoise was becoming less bloodshot and  his double chin less prominent until  he becam e 
less pachydermic all over and was able to tie his own shoes again. Watching him putting in latches  
and repairing clocks, Fernanda wondered whether or not he too might be falling into  the vice of 
building so that he could take apart like Colone l Aureliano Buendía and his little gold fishes, 
Amaranta and her shroud and her buttons, José Arcadio and the parchm ents, and Úrsula and her 
memories. B ut that was not th e case.  The worst part  was that the rain was  affecting ev erything and 
the driest of  machines would have flowers popping out among their gears if they wer e not oiled  
every three days, and the threads in brocades rusted , and wet clothing would break out in a rash of 
saffron-colo red moss. The air was so damp that fi sh could have come in  through the doors and  
swum out th e windows, floating through the atmo sphere in the rooms. One morning Úrsula woke 
up feeling that she was reaching her end in a pl acid swoon and she had already asked them to tak e 
her to Father Antonio Isabel, even if it had to b e on a stretcher, when Santa Sofía de la Piedad  
discovered that her ba ck was paved with leeches. S he took them off one by one, crushing them with  
a firebrand before they bled her to death. It was n ecessary to dig canals to get the water  out of the 
house and rid it of the frogs and snails so that they could dry the floors and take the bricks from 
under the bedposts and walk in shoes once more. Occupied with the many small details that call ed 
for his attention, Aureliano Segundo did not realize that he was g etting old until one afternoon when 
he found himself contemplating the premature d usk from a rocking chair and thinking about Petr a 
Cotes witho ut quivering. There would have been  no problem in going back to Fernanda’s insipid  
love, because her beauty had beco me solemn with age, but the rain had spared him from all 
emergencies of passion and had filled him with the spongy serenity of a lack of appetite. He amused  
himself thinking about the things that he could ha ve done in other times with that rain which had 
already lasted a year. He had been one of the first to bring zinc sheets to  Macondo, much earlier 
than their p opularization by the ba nana compan y, simply to roof Petra Cotes’s bedroom with them  
and to take pleasure in the feeling of deep intim acy that the sprinkling of the rain pro duced at tha t 
time. But even those wil d memories of his mad yo uth left him unmoved, just as during his last 
debauch he had exhausted his quota of salaciousne ss and all he had left was the marvelous gift of 
 154GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
being able to remem ber it without bitterness or re pentance. It might ha ve been tho ught that th e 
deluge had given him the opportunity to sit and refl ect and that the business of the pliers and the 
oilcan had a wakened in him the tard y yearning of so many useful trades that he might h ave followed 
in his life and did not; but neither case was true, because the tempta tion o f a sedentary domesticity 
that was bes ieging him was not the result of any re discovery or moral lesion. it came from much 
farther off,  unearthed by the rain ’s pitchfork from the days  when in Melquíades’ room he would 
read the pro digious fables about flyin g carpets an d whales that fed on entir e ships and their crews. It 
was during those days  that in a moment of care lessness little Aureliano ap peared on  the porch and  
his grandfather recognized the secret of his identi ty. He cut his hair, dressed him taught him not to 
be afraid of people, and very soon it was evident that he was a legitimate Aureliano Buendía, with his  
high cheekbones, his startled look, and his solitary air. It was a relief for Fernanda. For some time 
she had measured the extent of her pridefulness, but she could not find any way to remedy i t 
because th e more she th ought of solutions the le ss rational they seem ed to her. If she had known  
that Aurelia no Segundo was going to take thin gs the way he did, with the fine pleasure of a 
grandfather, she would n ot have taken so many turns or got so mixed up , but would have freed 
herself from mortification the year before Amar anta Úrsula, who already had her second teeth,  
thought of her nephew as a scurry ing toy who was a consolation for the tedium of the rain. 
Aureliano Segundo remembered th en the English en cyclopedi a tha t no one had sin ce touched in  
Meme’s old room. He began to show  the children the pictures, especia lly those of animals, and later  
on the maps  and photographs of remote countries and famous people. Si nce he did not know any  
English and could identify only the most famou s cities and people, he would invent names and 
legends to satisfy the children’s insatiable curiosity. 
Fernanda really believed that her husband was wa iting for it to clear to  return to his co ncubine.  
During the first months of the rain she was afrai d that he wo uld try to slip into her b edroom and 
that she wo uld have to undergo the shame o f revealing to him that she was incapable of 
reconciliation since the birth of Am aranta Úrsula. That was the reason for her anxious correspon-
dence with the invisible doctors, interrupted by fr equent disasters of th e mail. During the firs t 
months when it was lear ned that the trains were ju mping their tracks in the rain, a letter from the 
invisible doctors told her that h ers were not arriving. Later on, when con tact with th e unknown 
correspondents was broken, she had seriously thought of putting on the tige r mask that her husband 
had worn in the bloody carnival and having hersel f examined under a fictitious name by the banan a 
company do ctors. But on e of the man y people wh o regularly brought unpleasant n ews o f the delug e 
had told her  that th e company was  dismantling its dispensaries to move them to wh ere it was no t 
raining. The n she gave up hope. She resigned herself to waiting until the ra in stopped and the mail  
service was back to nor mal, and in the meantim e she sought relief from her secret ailments with  
recourse to her imagination, because she would rather  have died than put herself in the hands of the 
only doctor l eft in Macondo, the extra vagant Frenchman who a te grass like a donkey. She drew close 
to Úrsula, trusting that she would know of some pa lliative for her attacks. But her twisted habit of  
not calling things by their names made her put first things last and use “expelled” for “gave birth” 
and “burnin g” fo r “flow” so that it would all be  less shameful, with the result that Ú rsula reached 
the reasonab le conclusion that her trouble was intesti nal rather than uterine, and she advised her to 
take a dose of calomel on an empty stomach. If it  had not been for that suffering, which would hav e 
had nothing shameful about it for someone who did not suffer as well fro m shamefulness, and if it  
had not b een for the los s of the letters, the rain  would not have bothered  Fernanda, because, after  
all, her whole life had been spent as  if it had b een raining. She did not change her schedule or 
modify her ritual. When the table was still raised u p on bricks and the chairs put on pla nks so that  
those at the table woul d not get their feet wet, she still served with linen tablecl oths and fine 
chinaware a nd with lighted candles, because she fe lt that th e calamities should not be used as a 
 155GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
pretext for any relaxation in customs. No one went out into the street any more. If it had depended  
on Fernanda, they would  never have done so, not onl y since it started  raining but since long before  
that, because she felt that doors had been invented to stay clo sed and that curiosity fo r what was  
going on in the street was  a ma tter for  harlots. Yet she was the f irst one to lo ok out when  they wer e 
told that the funeral proc ession for Colonel Gerine ldo Márquez was passing by and even though she 
only watched it through the half-opened window it left  her in such a state of affliction that for a long 
time she rep ented in her weakness. 
She could not have conceived of a more desolate co rtege. They had put th e coffin in an oxcart 
over which they built a canopy of banana leaves, but the press ure of the rain was so intense and the 
streets so m uddy that wi th every step the wheels got stuck and the cover ing was on the verge of 
falling apart. The streams of sad water that fell on  the coffin were soaking the flag that had been 
placed on to p which was  actually th e flag staine d with blood and gunpowder that had b een rejected  
by more hon orable vetera ns. On th e coffin they ha d also placed  the saber with tass els of silver and  
copper, the same one that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez used to hang on the coat rack in order to go 
into Am aranta’s sewing r oom unarmed. Behind th e cart, so me barefoot an d all of them with their  
pants rolled up, splashing in the mud were the last survivors of the surrender at Neerlandia carrying 
a drover’s staff in one hand and in the other  a wreath of p aper fl owers tha t had becom e discolored  
in the rain. They appeared  like an unreal vision alo ng the street which still bore the name of Colonel 
Aureliano Buendía and they all looked at the ho use as they passed and turned the corner at the 
square, where they had to ask for help to move th e cart, which was stuck. Úrsula had herself carried 
to the door by Santa Sofía de la Piedad. She fo llowed the difficulties of the procession with such  
attention th at no one doubted that s he was seei ng it, especially because he r raised hand of an 
archangelic messenger was moving with the swa ying of the cart. 
“Good-bye, Gerineldo, my son,” she  shouted. “Say hello to my people and tell them I’ll see them  
when it stops raining.” 
Aureliano Segundo helped her back to bed and with  the same informality with which he always  
treated her, he asked her th e meaning of her farewell. 
“It’s true,” she said. “I’m only waiting for the rain to stop in order to die.” 
The condition of the streets alarmed Aureliano Se gundo. He finally became worried about the 
state of his animals and he threw an  oilcloth ov er his head and sent to Petra Cotes’s house. He 
found her in the courtyard, in the water up to  her waist, trying to float the corpse of a horse.  
Aureliano Segundo helped her with a lever, and the enormous swollen body gave a turn like a bell 
and was dra gged away b y the torrent of liquid mud. Since the rain began, all that Petr a Cotes had  
done was to clear her courtyard of dead animal s. During the first weeks she sent messages to  
Aureliano Segundo for him to take ur gent measures and he had answered that there was no rush, 
that the situ ation was not alarming, that there wo uld be plenty of time to think about something 
when it cleared. She sent him word that the horse  pastures were being flooded, that the cattle wer e 
fleeing to high ground, where ther e was nothing to eat and where they  were at th e mer cy of jaguars 
and sickness. “There’s no thing to be d one,” Aure liano Segundo answered her. “Others w ill be born  
when it cl ears.” Petra Cates had s een them die i n dusters an d the was a ble to butch er only thos e 
stuck in the mud. She saw with quiet impotence how the deluge was pitilessly exterminating a  
fortune that at one tim e was consi dered the la rgest and most solid in Macondo, and of which 
nothing remained but pestilence. When Aureliano Se gundo decided to go s ee wha t was going on, he 
found only t he corpse of the horse and a squalid  mule  in the ruins of the st able. Petra Cotes watched 
him arrive without surprise, joy, or resentment, a nd she only allowed herself an ironic smile. 
“It’s about time!” she said. 
She had aged, all skin and bones, and her tapere d eyes of a car nivorous animal had become sad  
and tame from looking at  the rain so much. Aureliano Segundo stayed at her house more than three 
 156GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
months, not because he felt better there than in that of his family, but because he n eeded all that 
time to make the decision to throw the piece of oilc loth back over his head. “There’s no rush,” he 
said, as he had said in the other home. “Let’s hope th at it clears in the next few hours.” During the 
course of the first week he became accustomed to th e inroads that time and th e rain had made in  the 
health of his concubine, and littl e by little he was seeing her as she had been before, remembering  
her jubilant excesses and the delirious fertility that her love provoked in the animals, and partly  
through love, partly through interest, one night du ring the second week he awoke her with urgent 
caresses. Petra Cotes did  not rea ct. “Go back to  sleep,” she murmured. “These aren’ t times  for 
things like t hat.” Aureliano Segundo saw himself in the mirrors on the ceiling, saw Petra Cotes’s 
spinal column like a row of spools st rung together  along a  cluster of withered nerves, a nd he saw 
that sh e was  right, not b ecause of th e times  but because of themselves, w ho were n o longer up to 
those things. 
Aureliano Segundo returned home with his trunks, convinced that not only Úrsula but all the 
inhabitants o f Macondo were waiting  for it to dea r in order to die. He had  seen th em a s he pass ed 
by, sitting in their parlors with an a bsorbed l ook and folde d arms, feeling unbroke n time pass , 
relentless times, because it was usele ss to divide  it into months and years, and the days into hours, 
when one could do nothing but contemplate the rain. The children greeted Aureliano Segundo with  
excitemen t because he wa s playing the asthmatic acco rdion for t hem again. But the concerts did not 
attract th eir attention a s much as the sessions  with the en cyclopedia, and once m ore they got 
together in Meme’s room, where Aureliano Segundo’ s imagination chang ed a dirigible  into a flying 
elephant wh o was looking for a place to sleep a mong the cloud s. On one occasion he came across a 
man on horseback who in spite of his strange ou tfit had a fa miliar look, and after examining him 
closely he ca me to the co nclusion that it was a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He showed it 
to Fernanda and she also admitted th e resemblan ce of the horseman not only  to the colonel but to  
everybody in  the family, although he was actually a Tartar warrior. Time passed in that way with the 
Colossus of Rhodes and snake charmers until his wi fe told hi m that there were only three pounds of 
dried meat and a sack of rice left in the pantry. 
And what do you want me to do abou t it?” he asked. 
“I don’t kno w,” Fernand a answered. “That’s men’s business.” 
“Well,” Aure liano Segundo said, “something will be done when it clears.” 
He was  more interested i n the encyclopedia than  In the dom estic problem,  even wh en he had to  
content hims elf with a scr ap of meat a nd a little rice  for lunch. “It’s impossible to do anything now,” 
he would sa y. “It can’t rain for the rest of our lives.” And while the urgencies of the pantry grew 
greater, Fernanda’s indignation also grew, until her eventual protests, her infrequent outbursts cam e 
forth in an uncontained, unchained torrent that  begin one morning like the monotonous  drone of a 
guitar and as  the day adv anced rose i n pitch, ri cher and more splendid. Au reliano Segundo was  not 
aware of the singsong until the fo llowing day after  breakfast wh en he felt hi mself being bothered b y 
a buzzing that was by th en more fluid and louder than the so und of the rain, and it was Fernanda, 
who was wal king throughout the hous e complainin g that they h ad raised her to be a queen only to  
have her end up as a servant in a madhouse, with a lazy, idolatrous, libertine husband who lay on his 
back waiting for bread to rain down from heaven while she wa s straining her kidneys trying to keep 
afloat a h ome held together with pins where ther e was  so mu ch to  do, so  much to b ear up under  
and repair from the time God gave his morning su nlight until it  was ti me to go to bed that when she 
got there her eyes were full of ground glass, an d yet no on e ever said to her, “Good morning, 
Fernanda, did you sleep well?” Nor had they asked her,  even out of courtesy, why she was so pale or 
why she awo ke with purple rings under her eyes in spite of the fact that she expected it, of course, 
from a family that had al ways considered her a nuisance, an old  rag, a booby painted on the wall, and  
who were always going a round saying things again st her behind her back, c alling her church mouse, 
 157GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
calling her Pharisee, calling her cra fty, and even A maranta, may she rest in peace, had said aloud that 
she was  one of those people who co uld not tell their rectums  from their ashes, God have mercy, 
such words, and she had tolerated everything with resignation b ecause of th e Holy Fath er, but sh e 
had not been able to to lerate it any more when  that evil José Arcadio Segundo said that the 
damnation o f the family had come when it open ed its doors to a stuck-up highlander, just imagine, a 
bossy highlander, Lord save us, a highlander daug hter of evil spit of the sa me s tripe as th e 
highlanders the government sent to kill workers, you tell me, and he was referring to no one but her,  
the godchild of the Duke of Alba, a lady of such lin eage that s he made th e liver of presidents’ wives  
quiver, a noble dame of fine blood  like her, who had the right to si gn eleven peninsular names and 
who was  the only mortal  creature in  that to wn full of bastards who did not feel all conf used at th e 
sight of sixteen pieces of silverware, so that her adulterous husband could die of laughter afterward 
and say that so many knives and forks and s poons were not meant for a human being but for a 
centipede,  and the only o ne who  coul d tell with  her eyes closed  when  the white wine wa s served and  
on what side and in which glass and when the red wi ne and on  what side and in which glass, and not 
like that pea sant of an Amaranta, ma y she rest in peace, who thought that wh ite wine was served in 
the daytim e and red wine at night, and the only o ne on the whole coast who could take pride in the 
fact tha t she took care o f her bodily needs only i n golden chamberpots, s o that Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía, may he rest in peace, could have the effrontery to ask her with his Masonic Ill humor 
where she had received that privilege and wheth er sh e did not shit shit but shat sweet basil, just 
imagine, with those very words, and so that Re nata, her own daughter, who through an oversight 
had seen her stool in the bedroom, had answered that even if the pot was al l gold and with a co at of 
arms, what was inside was pure sh it, physical shit,  and worse even th an any other kind because it was  
stuck-up highland shit, just imagine, her own daug hter, so that she never had any illusions about th e 
rest of the f amily, but in  any cas e she had th e right to expect a little mor e considerati on from her 
husband because, for better or for worse, he wa s her consecr ated spouse her helpmate, her legal  
despoiler, who took upon himself of his own fr ee and sovereign will the grave responsibility of  
taking her away from her paternal home, where sh e never wanted for or suffered from anything, 
where she wove funeral wreaths as a pastime, since her godfather had sent a letter with his signature 
and the stamp of his ring on the sealing wax simply  to say that the hands of his goddaughter were 
not mean t for tasks of this world except to pl ay the clavichord, and, nevertheless, her insane 
husband had taken her from her home with all manner of admonitions and warnings and had 
brought her to that frying pan of hell where a person could not breathe b ecause of th e heat, an d 
before she h ad completed her Pentecostal fast h e had gone off with his wandering trunks and his 
wastrel’s accordion to loaf in adultery with a wretc h of whom it was only enough to see her behind, 
well, that’s been said, to see her wiggle her mare’s behind in order to guess that she was  a, that sh e 
was a, just the opposite of her, who wa s a lady in a palace or  a pigsty, at  the table or in bed, a lady of  
breeding, God-fearing, obeying His laws and submissi ve to His wishes, and with whom he could not 
perform, naturally, the acrobatics and trampish antics  that he did with the other one, who, of course, 
was ready fo r anything like the French matrons, a nd even wor se, if one co nsiders well, because they 
at least had the honesty to put a red  light at their door, swinishness like that, just imagine, and tha t 
was all that was needed by the o nly and beloved daughter of Doña Renata Arg ote and Do n 
Fernando del Carpio, and especially the latter, a n upright man, a fine Christian, a Knight of the 
Order of the Holy Sepulcher, those who receive di rect from G od the privilege of remai ning intact in  
their graves with their skin smooth like the cheek s of a bride and their eyes alive and clear like 
emeralds. 
“That’s not true,” Aureliano Segundo interrupted her. “He wa s already beg inning to smell when  
they brought him here.” 
 158GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
He had th e patience to listen to h er for a whole d ay until he caug ht her in a sli p. Fernanda did not 
pay him  any mind, but sh e lowered  her voice. That night at dinner the exas perating buzzing of the 
singsong had conquered  the sound of the rain. Au reliano, Segundo ate very little, with his head  
down, and he went to his room early. At breakfast on the following day Fernanda was  trembling, 
with a look of not having slept well, and she seemed completely exhausted by her rancor. Never-
theless, when her husband asked if it was not possi ble to have a soft-boiled egg, she did not answer  
simply that they had run out of eggs the week bef ore, but she worked up a violent diatribe against 
men who  spent th eir tim e contemplating their navels and then had the gall to ask for larks’ livers at 
the table. Aureliano Segundo took the children to  look at the encyclopedia, as alwa ys, an d Fernanda  
pretended to  straighten o ut Meme’s r oom just so  that h e coul d listen to  her muttering, of course,  
that it certai nly took cheek for him  to tell the poor innocents  that there was a picture of Colonel 
Aureliano B uendía in the encycloped ia. During th e afternoon, while the chi ldren were having their 
nap, Aureliano Segundo sat on the porch and Fernan da pursued him even there, provoking him, 
tormenting him, hovering about him with her impl acable hor sefly buzzing, saying that, of course, 
while there was nothing to eat except stones, her husband was sitting there like a sultan of Persia , 
watching it rain, because that was all he was, a sl ob, a sponge, a good-for-not hing, softer than cotton 
batting, used to living off women and convinced th at he had married Jonah’s wife, who was so 
content with  the story of the whale. Aureliano Segundo listened to her for more than two hours,  
impassive, as if he were deaf. He did not interrupt  her until late in the after noon, when he could no 
longer bear the echo of the bass drum that was tormenting his head. 
“Please shut up,” he begged. 
Fernanda, quite the con trary, raised her pitch. “I don’t have any reason to shut up,” she said.  
“Anyone who doesn’t want to listen to me can go  someplace else.” Then Aureliano Segundo lost 
control. He stood up un hurriedly, as if he only intended to  stretch, and wi th a perfectly regulated 
and methodi cal fury he grabbed the p ots with th e begonias one after the oth er, those with the ferns, 
the oregano, and one after the  other he smashe d them onto the floor. Fernanda was  frightened 
because unti l then sh e had really no t had a clea r indication of the tremen dous inner force of her  
singsong, but it was too late for any attempt at rect ification. Intoxicated by the uncontain ed torrent 
of relief, Aureliano Segundo broke the glass on the china closet and piece by piece, witho ut hurrying, 
he took ou t the chinaware and sh attered it on th e floor. Systematically,  serenely, in the same 
parsimonious way in whi ch he had  papered the house  with ba nknotes, he then set abo ut smashing 
the Bohemia n crystal war e against the walls, the ha nd-painted vases, the pictures of maidens in flow-
er-laden boats, the mirrors in their gilded frames , everything that was brea kable, from  parlor to 
pantry, and he finished with the large earthen jar in the kitchen, which exploded in the middle of the 
courtyard wi th a hollow boom. Then he washed his hands, threw the oil cloth over himself, and 
before midnight he return ed with a few strings of dried meat, s everal bags of rice, corn with weevils, 
and some emaciated bu nches of bananas. From then on there was no mor e lack of food. 
Amaranta  Úrsula and little Aureliano  would rem ember the rains as a ha ppy time. In  spite of  
Fernanda’s strictness, they would splash in the pu ddles in the courtyard, ca tch lizards a nd dissect 
them, and pretend that they were poisoning the soup  with dust from butterfly wings when Santa  
Sofía de la  Piedad was not looking Úrsula was their most amusing plaything. They looked upon her 
as a big,. broken-down doll that they carried back and forth from one corner to another wrapped in 
colored cloth and with h er face p ainted with  soot  and annatto, and once they were on the point of  
plucking out her eyes with the prun ing shears as they had done with the frogs. Nothing gave them as  
much excitement as the wanderings of her mind . Something, indeed, must have happened to her 
mind during the third yea r of the rain,  for she was gradually losing her sense of reality and  confusing 
present time with remote periods of her life to the point where, on one occasion, she spent three 
days weepin g deeply over the dea th of Petronila Ig uarán, her great-grandmother, buried for over a 
 159GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
century. She sank into such an insane state of co nfusion that she thought little Aureliano was her 
son the colo nel during the time he wa s taken  to see ice, and th at the José Arcadio who  was at tha t 
time in the s eminary was her firs tborn who had gone off with the gy psies. S he spoke so much about 
the family that the children learned to make up imaginary visits with beings who had not only been  
dead for a l ong time, but who had  existed at diffe rent times. Sitting on the bed, her hair covered  
with ashes  and her face wrapped in a red kerchi ef, Úrsula was happy in the midst of the unreal  
relatives wh om the child ren describe d in all detail, as if they ha d really known them. Úrsula would  
converse with her forebears about events that to ok place before her own existence, enjoying the 
news they ga ve her, and she would weep with th em over deaths that were much more recent than  
the guests themselves. The children did not take long  to notice that in the course of those ghostly 
visits Úrsula  would always ask a question destined to establis h the one who had brought a life-size 
plaster Saint Joseph to the house to be kept until the rains stopped. It was in that way that Aureliano 
Segundo remembered the fortune b uried in some place that only Úrsula knew, but th e questions a nd 
astute ma neuvering that occurred to him were of no use becaus e in the labyr inth of her madness she  
seemed to pr eserve enough of a margin of lucidi ty to keep the s ecret which s he would reveal only to  
the one who could prove that he was the real owner of the buried gold. She was so skillful and strict 
that wh en Aureliano Segundo instructed one of hi s carousing companions to pass himself off as the 
owner of the fortune, she got him all caught up in a minute inter rogation sown with subtle traps. 
Convinced that Úrsula would carry the secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a crew of 
diggers under the pretext that they were making so me drainage canals in the courtya rd and the 
backyard, and he himsel f took soundings in th e earth with iron bars and all manner of metal-
detectors without finding anything th at resembled  gold in three months of exhaustive exploration. 
Later on he went to Pilar Ternera with the hop e that  the cards  would we m ore than the diggers, but 
she began b y explaining that an y attempt would  be useless unl ess Úrsula cut the cards. On the other 
hand, she confirmed the existence of the treas ure with the precision of its consisting of seven 
thousand two hundred f ourteen coin s buried in th ree canvas  sacks reinf orced with  copper wire 
within a circle with a rad ius of three hundred ei ghty-eight feet with Úrsula’s bed as th e center, but  
she warned  that it woul d not be found until it  stopped raining and the sun s of three consecutive 
Junes had changed the piles of mu d into dust . The profusion and meticulous vagueness of the 
information seemed to Aureliano Segundo so similar to  the tales of spiritualists that he kept on with  
his enterprise in spite of the fact that they were in August and they wo uld have to  wait a t least three 
years in ord er to satisfy the co nditions of the pr ediction. The first thing that startled him, even  
though it increased his confusion at the same time,  was the fact that it was precisely three hundred 
eighty-eight feet from Úrsula’s bed to  the ba ckyar d wall. Fernanda feared that he was a s crazy as his 
twin brother when she saw him taking the measurem ents, and even more when he told the digging  
crew to make the ditches  three feet deeper. Overco me by an exploratory delirium comparable only 
to tha t of his great-grandfather wh en he was s earchi ng for the route of inventions, Aureliano Segun-
do lost the last layers of fat that he had left and the old resemblance to his twin brother wa s 
becoming accentu ated ag ain, not onl y because of his slim figure, but also because of the distant air 
and the with drawn attitu de. He no longer bothered with the children. He ate at odd hours, muddled 
from head to  toe, and he did so in a corner in the kitchen, barely answering the occasional questions 
asked by Santa Sofía de la Piedad. Seeing him work  that way, as she had never dreamed him capabl e 
of doing, Fernanda thoug ht that his stubbornness was diligence, his greed abnegation, and his thick-
headedness perseverance, and her insides tightened with remo rse over the virulence with which she 
had attacked his idleness. But Aureliano Segundo was in no mood for merciful reconciliations at that 
time. Sunk u p to his neck in a moras s of dead br andies and r otting flowers, he flung the dirt of th e 
garden all about after having finished with the courtyard and the backyard, and he excavated so  
deeply under the foundations of the east wing of the house that one night they woke up in terror at 
 160GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
what seem ed to be an earthquake, as much beca use of the trembling as the fearful underground 
creaking. Three of the rooms were collapsing and a frightening crack had opened up from the porch  
to Fernanda’s room. Aureliano Segundo did not give up the search because of that. Even when his  
last hopes had been exti nguished and the only thin g that seemed to mak e any sens e was what the 
cards had p redicted, he reinforced the jagged fo undation, repaired the crack with  mortar, and  
continued on the side to the west. He was still the re on the second week of the following June when  
the rain began to abate an d the clouds began to lif t and it was obvious from one moment to the next 
that it was going to clear. That was what happ ened. On Friday at two in  the afterno on the worl d 
lighted up wi th a crazy crimson sun as harsh as bric k dust and al most as cool  as water, and it did not 
rain again for ten years. 
Macondo was in ruins. In the s wampy streets  there were the rem ains of furniture, animal 
skeletons covered with red lilies, the last memor ies of the hordes of newcomers who had fled  
Macondo as  wildly as th ey had arrived. The houses that had been built with such haste during the 
banana fever had been  abandoned.  The ban ana compan y tore down i ts installatio ns. All tha t 
remained of the former wired-in city were the r uins. The wooden houses, the cool  terraces for 
breezy card-playing afternoons, seemed  to have been blown away in an anticipation of the propheti c 
wind that years later wou ld wipe Macondo off the face of the earth. The o nly human trace left b y 
that voracio us blast was  a glove bel onging to Patr icia Brown in an automobile smothered in wild 
pansies. The enchanted region explored by José Ar cadio Buendí a in the d ays of the foun ding, where 
later on the banana plantations flourished, was a bog of rotting roots, on the horizon of which one 
could manage to see the silent foam of the sea. Aureliano Segundo went through a crisis of affliction  
on the first Sunday that he put on d ry clothes and went ou t to renew his acquaintan ce with the 
town. The s urvivors of the catastrop he, the s ame ones who  had been  living in Macondo before it 
had been  struck by th e banana comp any hurrican e, were sittin g in the mid dle of the s treet enjoying 
their first sunshine. They still had the green of th e algae on their skin and the musty smell of a 
corner that had been stamped on them by the rain, but in their hearts they seemed ha ppy to have 
recovered th e town in  which they ha d been born . The Street of the Turks was again what it h ad 
been earlier, in the days when the Ar abs with s lippers and rings in their ears were going about the 
world swapping knickkna cks for macaws and had fo und in Macondo a good bend in the road where 
they could fi nd respite from their age-old lot as wa nderers. Having crossed through to the other side 
of the rain. the merchand ise in the bo oths was fall ing apart, the cloths spread over the doors were 
splotched wi th mold, th e counters un dermined by ter mites, th e walls eaten  away by da mpness, but 
the Arabs of the third generation wer e sitting in th e same pla ce and in the same position as their 
fathers and grandfathers, taciturn, dau ntless, invulnerab le to time and disas ter, as alive or as dead as  
they had been after the insomnia plague and Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s thirty-two wars. Their 
strength of spirit in the face of ruins of the gaming tables, the fri tter stands, the shooting galleries, 
and the alley where th ey interpreted d reams and p redicted th e future made Aureliano Segundo ask 
them with hi s usual informality what mysterious resources they had relied upon so as not to hav e 
gone awash in the storm, what the dev il they had done so as not to drown, and one after the other, 
from door to door, they returned a crafty smile  and a drea my look, an d without a ny previous  
consultation they all gave the answer:  
“Swimming.” 
Petra Cotes was perhaps the only native who had an Arab heart. She had seen  the fina l 
destruction of her stables, her ba rns dragged off by the stor m. bu t she had managed to keep her 
house standi ng. During the second year she had sent pressing messages to Aureliano Segundo and 
he had answered that he did not know when he woul d go back to her house, but that in any case h e 
would bring along a box of gold coins to pave the bedroom floor with. A t that time s he had dug 
deep into her heart, searching for the strength th at would allow her to survive the misfortune, and  
 161GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
she had discovered a reflective and just rage with which she had sworn to restore the fortune 
squandered by her lover and then wiped out by the deluge. It was such an unbreakable decision that  
Aureliano Segundo went back to her house eight mont hs after  the las t message and fou nd her green  
disheveled, with sunken eyelids and s kin spangled with mange, but she was  writing out numbers on  
small pieces of paper to make a raffle. Aureliano Segundo was astonished, and he was s o dirty and  
so solemn that Petra Cotes almost believed that the one who had come to see her was not the lover 
of all her life  but his twin brother. 
“You’re crazy,” he told her. “Unless y ou plan to raffle off bones.” 
Then she told him to look in the bedroom and Aureliano Segundo saw the mule. Its skin was 
clinging to its bones like that of its  mistress, but it  was just as al ive and re solute as she. P etra Cotes 
had fed it wi th her wrath,  and when there was no more  hay or corn or roots, she had given it shelter  
in her own bedroom an d fed it on the percale sh eets, th e Persian rugs, the plush bedspreads, th e 
velvet drapes, and the can opy em broidered with gold thread and  silk tassels on the episco pal bed.

Chapter 17 
ÚRSULA HAD to make a great effort to fulfill her prom ise to die when it cleared. The waves of 
lucidity that were so scar ce during the rains beca me more frequent after August, when an and wi nd 
began to blow and suffocated th e rose bushes and petrified the piles of mud, and ended u p 
scattering over Macondo the burning dust that cove red the rusted zinc roofs and the age-old almond  
trees forever. Úrsula cried in lamenta tion when s he discovered that for m ore than thr ee years she 
had been a plaything for the children . She washed he r painted face, took off the strips of brightly 
colored cloth, the dried l izards and frogs, and the rosaries and old Arab necklaces tha t they had hung 
all over her body, and fo r the first ti me since the death  of Amaranta sh e got up out o f bed withou t 
anybody’s help to join in the family life once m ore. The spirit of her in vincible heart guided her 
through the shadows. Those who noticed her stumbling and who bumped into the archa ngelic arm 
she kept raised at head level thought that she was having troub le with her body, but they still did not 
think she was blind. She did not need to see to rea lize that th e flower beds, cultivated wi th such car e 
since the first rebuilding, had been destroyed b y the rain and ruined by Aureliano Segundo’s 
excavations, and that the walls and th e cemen t of the floors were cracked, the furniture mushy and  
discolored, the doors off their hinges, and the family  menaced by a spirit of resigna tion and despair  
that was in conceivable in her time. Feeling her way along through the empty b edrooms she 
perceived th e continuous  rumble of the termites a s they carved  the wood, the snipping of the moths 
in the clothes closets, and the devastating noise of  the enormous red ants that had prospered during 
the deluge and were undermining the foundations of the house. One day s he opened the trunk with 
the saints an d had to ask Santa Sofía de la Piedad  to get off her body the cockroaches that jumped  
out and that had alread y turned th e clothing to d ust. “A pers on can’t live in neglect like this,” she 
said. “If we go on like this we’ll be devoured by an imals.” From then on she did not have a moment 
of repose. Up before dawn, she would use anybody available, even the ch ildren. She put the few 
articles of clothing that were still us able out into the sun, s he drove the cockroaches off with  
powerful insecticide atta cks, she scratched out th e veins that the termites  had made o n doors and 
windows and asphyxiated the ants in their anthills with quicklime. The fever of restora tion finally 
brought her to the forgotten rooms. She cleared ou t the rubble and cobwebs in the room where José 
Arcadio Buendía had lost his wits looking for th e Philosopher’s stone, she put the silver shop which 
had been up set by th e soldiers in order, and lastly she asked for the keys to  Melquíades’ room to see 
what state it was in. Faith ful to the wishes of José Arcadio Seg undo, who had forbidden anyone to 
come in unless there was a clear indica tion that h e had died, Santa Sofía de la Piedad tried all kinds 
of subterfuges to throw Úrsula off the tra ck. But  so inflexible was h er determin ation not to  
surrender even the most remote cor ner of the h ouse to  the insects that s he knocked down ever y 
obstacle in h er path, and after three days of in sistence she su cceeded in g etting them to open the 
door for her. She had to hold on to the doorjamb so tha t the s tench would not knock h er over, but 
she needed only two seconds to remember that the schoolgirls’ seventy-two chamberpots were in 
there and tha t on one of the rainy nights a patrol of  soldiers had  searched the house looking fo r José  
Arcadio Segundo and had been unabl e to find him. 
“Lord save us!” she exclaimed, as if she coul d see everything. “So much trouble teach ing you  
good manners and you end up living like a pig.” 
José Arcadio Segundo was still rea ding over th e parchments. The on ly thing visible in the 
intricate tan gle of hair was the teeth striped with green dime and his motionless eyes. When h e 
recognized h is great-grandmother’s voice he turned  his head  toward th e door, tried to smile, and  
without knowing it repeated an old phrase of Úrsula’s. 
 163GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“What did you expect?” he murmured. “Time passes.” 
“That’s how it goes,” Úrsula said, “but not so much.” 
When she said it she realized that she was givi ng the same reply that Colonel Aureliano Buendía 
had given in his death cell, and once again she shuddered with the evidence that time was not 
passing, as she had just admitted, but that it was tu rning in a circle. But even then she did not give 
resignation a chance. She scolded José Arcadio Segu ndo as if he were a child and insisted that he 
take a bath and shave and lend a hand in fixing up the house. The simple idea of abandoning the 
room that h ad given him peace ter rified José Arcadio Segundo. He shouted tha t there was n o 
human power capable of making hi m go out b ecause h e did not wan t to see the tr ain with two  
hundred cars loaded with dead people which left Macondo every day at dusk on its way to the sea . 
“They were all of those who were at the station,” he shouted. “Three thousand four hundred eight.” 
Only th en di d Úrsula realize th at he was in a  worl d of shadows  more impenetrable than hers, as un-
reachable an d solitary as that of his great-grandfat her. She left him in the room, but she succeeded in 
getting them  to leave th e padlock off, clean it every day, thro w the ch amberpots awa y except for 
one, and to keep José Arcadio Segundo as clean an d presentable as his great-grandfather had been 
during his long captivity under th e chestnut tree. At first F ernanda  interpreted tha t bustle as an  
attack of senile madness and it was difficult for he r to suppress her exasperation. But about that time 
José Arcadio  told her th at he planned  to come to  Macondo from Rome befor e taking his final vows, 
and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that from morning to night she would be seen 
watering the flowers four times a day s o that her so n would not have a bad impression of the house. 
It was that s ame incentive which ind uced her to  speed up her correspondence with the invisible  
doctors and to replace th e pots of ferns and oreg ano and the begonias on the porch even before 
Úrsula found out that they had been destroyed by Aureliano Segundo’s ext erminating fury. Later on 
she sold the silver servic e and bought ceramic dishes, pewter bowls and soup spoons, and alpaca 
tablecloths, and with them brought poverty to th e cupboard s that had been accus tomed to India 
Company chinaware and Bohemian crystal. Úrsula always tried to go a step beyond.  “Open the 
windows and the doors,” she shouted. “Cook some me at and  fish, buy the largest turtles around, let 
strangers come and spread their mats in the corners and urinate in the rose bushes and  sit down to 
eat as many times as they want and belch and ra nt and muddy everything with their boots, and let 
them do wh atever they want to us, because th at’s the only way to drive o ff rain.” But it was a vain  
illusion. She was too old then and living on borrowed time to repeat the m iracle of the little candy 
animals, and  none of her descendants had inher ited her strength. The house stayed closed on 
Fernanda’s orders. 
Aureliano Segundo, who had taken his trunks ba ck to the house of Petra Cotes, barely h ad 
enough mea ns to see th at the family did not starve  to death. With the raffling of the mule, Petra 
Cotes and he bought some more animals with which they managed to set up a primitive lotter y 
business. Aureliano Segundo would go from ho use to house selling the tickets that he himself  
painted with  colored ink to make th em more at tractive and convincing, and perhaps he did not 
realize that many people bought them out of gratit ude and m ost of them out of pity. Nevertheless , 
even the mo st pitying purchaser was getting a ch ance to win a pig for twenty cen ts or a calf for 
thirty-two, and they became so hopef ul that on T uesday nights Petra Cotes’s courtyard overflowed  
with people waiting for the moment when a child  picked at random drew the winning number from 
a bag. It did not take long to become a weekly fair, for at dus k food and drink stands would be s et 
up in the courtyard and many of those who were favored would slaughter the animals they had wo n 
right there o n the conditi on that som eone else su pply the liqu or and mu sic, so tha t without having 
wanted to, Aureliano Segundo suddenly found himself playing the accordion  again and participating  
in modest to urneys of voracity. Those humble replic as of the revelry of former times served to show 
Aureliano Segundo himself how much his spirits ha d declined and to what a degree his skill as a 
 164GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
masterful carouser had dried up. He was a changed man. The two hundred forty pounds that he had  
attained during the days when he ha d been challenged by The Elephant had been reduced to one 
hundred fifty-six; the glowing and blo ated tortoise fa ce had  turn ed into that of an iguana, and h e was 
always on th e verge of boredom and fatigue. For Petra Cotes, however, he had never been a better  
man than a t that time, p erhaps becaus e the pity tha t he inspired was mixed with love, and because of 
the feeling o f solidarity that misery aroused in both of them. T he broken-d own bed ceased to be the  
scene of wild activities and was chan ged into an intimate refuge. Freed of the repetiti ous mirrors, 
which had  been au ctioned off to buy animals for th e lottery, an d from the l ewd damasks and velvets, 
which the mule had eaten, they would stay up very late with the i nnocence of  two sleepless 
grandparents, taking advantage of the time to dr aw up accounts and put away pennies  which they 
formerly wasted just for the sake of  it. Sometimes the cock’s crow would find them piling and 
unpiling coin s, taking a bit away from here to put th ere, to that this bunch would be enough to keep 
Fernanda happy and that would be for Amaranta Úr sula’s sho es, and that other one for Santa Sofía  
de la Piedad,  who had  not had a new dress since the ti me of all the noise,  and this to  order the coffin 
if Úrsula died, and this for the coffee which wa s going up a cent a pou nd in price every three 
months, and this for the sugar which sweeten ed less every day, and this for the lumber which was  
still wet from the rains, and this other one for the paper and the colored ink to make tickets wi th, 
and what wa s left over to pay off the winner of  the April calf whose hide they had miraculously 
saved when it came down with a symptomatic carb uncle just when all of the numbers  in the raffle 
had already been sold. Those rites of poverty were so pure that they nea rly always set aside th e 
largest share for Fernanda, and th ey did not do so  out of remo rse or charity, but becau se her well-
being was m ore importa nt to them  than their o wn. What was  really happening to them, although 
neither of th em realized i t, was tha t they both tho ught of Fernanda as the daughter tha t they would 
have liked to have and never did, to the point wh ere on a certain occasion they resigned themselves  
to ea ting crumbs for three days, so  that she co uld buy a Dutch  tableclo th. Nevertheless , no ma tter 
how much they killed themselves with work, no matter how much money th ey eked out, and no 
matter ho w many sch emes they thou ght of, their guar dian angels were asleep with fatigue while they 
put in coins and took them out trying to get just enough to live with. During the waking hours when  
the accounts  were bad. they wondered  what had happened in the world for the animals not to breed  
with the sam e drive as before, why m oney slipped through their fingers, and why p eople who a sho rt 
time before had burned rolls of bills in the carousi ng considered it highway robbery to charge twelve  
cents for a raffle of six hens. Aureliano Segundo thought without saying so that th e evil was not i n 
the world b ut in some hidden place in the mys terious heart of Petra Cotes, where so mething had 
happened du ring the deluge that had  turned the an imals sterile and made money scarce. Intrigued by 
that enigma, he dug so  deeply into  her sentiments  that in search of interest he found lo ve, becaus e 
by trying to make her lov e him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved 
him more an d more as  she felt his lov e increasing , and that was  how in the ripeness of autumn she 
began to believe once more in the youthful superst ition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both  
looked back  then  on th e wild revel ry, the gaud y wealth, an d the unbridled fornication as an  
annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to fund the paradise of  
shared solitude. Madly in love after so many year s of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of  
loving each other as much at the tabl e as in bed, and they grew to be so h appy tha t even when th ey 
were two worn-out old people they kept on blooming  like little children and playing together like  
dogs. 
The raffles never got very far. At first Aure liano Segundo would spend three days of the week  
shut up in w hat had been his rancher’s office dra wing ticket after ticket, Painti ng with a fair s kill a 
red cow, a green pig, or a group of blue hens, according to the animal being raffled, a nd he woul d 
sketch out a good imitation of printed numbers and the name that Petra Cotes thought good to call  
 165GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
the business:  Divine Providence Raffles . But with tim e he felt so tir ed after dra wing up to two thousand 
tickets a week that he ha d the animal s, the name, and the num bers put on rubber stamps, and then  
the work wa s reduced to moistening them on  pads  of different colors. In his la st years it occurred to  
him to substitute riddles for the numbers so that the prize could be shared by all of those who 
guessed it, b ut the system turned out to be so complicated and was open to so much suspicion that 
he gave it up after the second attemp t. 
Aureliano Segundo was so busy tryin g to maintai n the prestig e of his raffles that h e barely had 
time to see the children. Fernanda put Amaranta Úrsula in a small private school where they 
admitted onl y six girls, but she refused to allow Aureliano to  go to public school. She considered 
that sh e had  already relented to o mu ch in letting him leave the room. Besi des, the schools in those 
days accep ted only the legitimate offspring of Catho lic marriages and on the birth certificate tha t had 
been pinned  to Aureliano’s clothing  when th ey brought him to the house he was registered as  a 
foundling. So he remained shut In at the mercy of  Santa Sofía de la Piedad’s loving eyes and Úrsula’s 
mental quirks, learning in the narrow world of th e house whatever his grandmothers explained to 
him. He was  delicate, thi n, with a  curiosity that unnerved the adults, but u nlike the inq uisitive and  
sometimes clairvoyant look that th e colonel had at  his age, his look was blinking and somewhat 
distracted. While Amar anta Úrsula was in kinderga rten, h e would hunt earthworms  and torture 
insects in th e garden. But once when Fernanda ca ught him putting scorpions in a b ox to put in  
Úrsula’s bed, she locked him up in Meme’s old room, where he spent hi s solitary hours looking 
through the pictures in the ency cloped ia. Úrsula found him ther e one afternoon when she was going 
about sprinkling the house with distil led water an d a bunch o f nettles, an d in spite of the fact tha t 
she had been  with him m any times sh e asked him who he was.  
“I’m Aureliano Buendía,” he said. 
“That’s right ” she replied. “And now it’s time fo r you to start learning how to be a silversmith.” 
She had confused him with her son again, because the hot wi nd that cam e after the deluge and 
had brought occasional waves of lucidity to Úrsul a’s brain had passed. She never got her reason 
back. When she went in to the bedro om she found Petronila Iguarán there with the bothersome 
crinolines and the beaded  jacket that she put on fo r formal visit s, and she fo und Tranquilina Maria 
Miniata Alacoque Buendía, her grandmother, fanning herself w ith a peacock fe ather in her in valid’s  
rocking chair, and her great-grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendía, with his imitation dolman of  
the viceregal guard, and Aureliano Iguarán, her fa ther, who had invented a prayer to make the 
worms shrivel up and dr op off cows, and her tim id mother, a nd her cousin with the p ig’s tail, and 
José Arcadio Buendía, and her dead s ons, all sitting in  chairs lined up against the wall as  if it were a  
wake and  not a visit. She was tying a  colorful stri ng of chatter to gether, com menting on things from 
many separate places  and many different times, so  that when Amaranta Úrs ula returned from school 
and Aureliano grew tired of the encyclopedia, they would find her sitting on her bed, talking to 
herself and lost in a labyrinth of dead people. “F ire!” she shouted once in  terror and for an instant  
panic spread through the house, but what she was telling abo ut was the burning o f a barn that she 
had witnessed when she was four yea rs old. She fina lly mixed up the pas t with the present in such a  
way that in the two or three waves of lucidity that she had before she died, no one knew for certai n 
whether she was speaki ng about what she felt or  what she remembered. Little by little she wa s 
shrinking, turning into a fetus, becom ing mummified in life to the point that in her last months s he 
was a cherry raisin lost inside of her nightgown, and the arm th at she al ways kept raised l ooked like 
the paw of a  marimonda monkey. She was motionl ess for several days, and Santa Sofía de la Piedad  
had to sh ake her to  convince herself that she wa s alive and s at her on  her lap to feed  her a fe w 
spoonfuls of sugar water.  She looked like a newb orn old woman. Amaranta Úrsula and  Aureliano 
would take her in and out of the bedroom, they would lay her on the altar to see if she was any 
larger than the Christ chi ld, and one afternoon they hid her in  a closet in the Pantry where the rats  
 166GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
could have eaten h er. On e Palm Sund ay th ey went into th e bed room while Fernanda wa s in church  
and carried Úrsula out by the neck an d ankles. 
“Poor great-great-grand mother,” Amaranta  Úrsula said. “Sh e died of old age.” 
Úrsula was startled. 
“I’m alive!” s he said. 
“You can see.” Amaranta Úrsula said, suppressing her laughter, “that she’s not even breathing.” 
“I’m talking! ” Úrsula sho uted. 
“She can’t even talk,” Aureliano said. “She died like a little cricket.” 
Then Úrsula gave in to the evidence.  “My God,” sh e exclaimed in a low voice. “So this is what 
it’s like to be dead.” She started an en dless, stumb ling, deep prayer that lasted more than two days, 
and that by Tuesday had  degenerated  into a hodg epodge of requests to God and bits of practical  
advice to s top the red  ants from bringing the hous e down, to  keep th e lamp  burning by Remedios’ 
daguerreotype, and never to let any Buendía marry a person of the same blood because thei r 
children would be born with the tai l of a pig. Aureliano Segundo tried to take advantage of her 
delirium to get her to ten  him where the gold wa s buried, but his entreaties were useless once mor e 
“When the owner appears,” Úrsula said, “God will illumi nate him so that he will find it.” Santa Sofía 
de la Piedad had the certa inty that they would fi nd her dead from one moment to the next, because 
she noticed during those days a certai n confusion in nature: the roses smelled like goosefoot, a pod  
of chick peas  fell down an d the b eans lay on the gr ound in a perfect geometrical pattern i n the sh ape 
of a starfish and one night she saw a r ow of luminous orange disks pass across the sky. 
They found her dead on the morning of Good Frid ay. The last time tha t they had  helped her  
calculate her  age, during the time of the banana  company, she had estimated it as between one 
hundred fifteen and one hundred twenty-two. They buri ed her in a coffin that was not much larger 
than the bas ket in which  Aureliano had arrived, an d very few people were at  the fu neral, partly 
because th ere wet not many left who  remembered her, and partly because it was so hot that noon  
that the bird s in their co nfusion were running in to walls like day pigeon s and breaki ng through 
screens to di e in the bedr ooms. 
At first they thought it was a plague. Housewive s were exhausted from sweeping away so many 
dead birds, especially at s iesta time,  and the m en dumped them into th e river by the cartload. On 
Easter Sund ay the hundr ed-year-old Father Anto nio Is abel stated from th e pulpit that the dea th of 
the birds wa s due to  the evil influence of the Wa ndering Jew, whom h e himself had seen the night 
before. He described him as a cross between a billy  goat and a female heretic, an infernal beast 
whose breath scorched the air and whose look  brought on the birth of  monsters in newlywed  
women. There were not many who paid attention to his apocalyptic talk, for the town wa s 
convinced th at the priest was ramblin g because of  his age. But one woman  woke ev erybody up a t 
dawn on Wednesday because she found the tracks of  a biped with a cloven hoof. They  were so clear 
and unmistakable that those who went to look at them had  no doubt about the existence of a 
fearsome creature similar to the one  described by the parish priest an d they got together to set traps  
in their courtyards. That was how they managed to  capture it. Two weeks a fter Úrsula’s death, Petra  
Cotes and Aureliano Segundo woke up frightened by the especi ally loud bellowing of a calf that was  
coming from  nearby. When they got there a group  of men were already pulling the mon ster off the 
sharpened stakes they had set in the bottom of a pi t covered with dry leaves, and it stopped lowing.  
It was as hea vy as an ox in spite of the fact that it was no taller than a youn g steer, and a green and 
greasy liquid  flowed fro m its wounds. Its body  was covered with rough hair, plagued with small 
ticks, and the skin was hardened with  the scales of a remora fish, but unlike the priest’s description, 
its human parts were m ore like those of a sickly an gel than of a man, for its hands were tense and  
agile, its eyes large and gloomy, and on its shoulder  blades it had the scarred-over and calloused  
stumps of powerful wings which mus t have been chopped off by a woods man’s ax. They hung it to 
 167GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
an almond tree in the sq uare by its a nkles so that everyone co uld see it, an d when it b egan to ro t 
they burned it in a bonfire, for they could not dete rmine whether its bastar d nature was  that of an 
animal to be thrown into the river or a human being to be buried. It was never established whether 
it had really caused th e death of the b irds, but the newly married women di d not bear the predicted  
monsters, nor did the intens ity of the heat decreas e. 
Rebeca died at the end of  that year. Argénida, he r lifelong servant, asked th e authorities for help 
to knock do wn the door to th e bedr oom where her mistress had been  locked in for three days, and  
they found her, on her solitary bed, curled up like a shrimp, wit h her head b ald from rin gworm and 
her finger in her mouth. Aureliano Segundo took charge of the  funera l and tried to restore the house 
in order to sell it, but the destruction was so far advanced in it that the walls became scaly as soon as  
they were pa inted and th ere was no t enough mortar to stop  the weeds  from cracking the floors and  
the ivy from rotting the beams. 
That was ho w everything went after the deluge. The indolence of the people was in co ntrast to  
the voracity of oblivion, which little by little was un dermining memories in a pitiless way, to such an 
extreme that at that time,  on another anniversary of  the Treaty of Neerlandia, some emissaries from 
the presiden t of the rep ublic arrived in Macond o to award at last the d ecoration rej ected  several  
times by Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and they sp ent a whole afternoon looking for someone who 
could tell th em wh ere th ey could  find one of hi s descend ants. Aureliano Segundo wa s temp ted to  
accept it, thi nking that it was a meda l of solid go ld, but Petra Cotes convinced him th at it was not  
proper when the emissaries already had some proclamations an d speeches ready for the ceremony. It 
was also around that tim e that the gypsies return ed, the las t heirs to Melq uíades’ scien ce, and  they 
found the town so defeated and its inhabitants s o removed from the rest of the world that once 
more they went through the houses d ragging magnetize d ingots as if that really were the Babylonian 
wise men’s latest discov ery, and once again they concen trated the su n’s rays with the giant 
magnifying glass, and there was no lack of peopl e standing open-mouthed watching kettles fall and 
pots roll and who paid fifty cents to be startled a s a gypsy woman put in her false teeth and took 
them out again. A broken-down yellow train tha t neither brought anyone in nor took anyone ou t 
and that s carcely paused at the deserted station was the only thing that wa s left of the long train to 
which Mr. Brown would couple his glass-topped coach with the episcopal l ounging chairs and of the 
fruit trains w ith one hundred twenty cars which t ook a whole afternoon to pass by. The ecclesiastical  
delegates wh o had come to investigate the report of  the strange death of th e birds and the sacrifice 
of the Wand ering Jew found Father Antonio Isa bel playing blind man’s buff with the children, and  
thinking that his report w as the product of a halluci nation, they took him off to an asylum. A short 
time later th ey sent Fath er Augusto Angel, a crusader of the new breed,  intransigent, audacious, 
daring, who personally rang the bells several times  a day so that the peopl es spirits wo uld not get 
drowsy, and who wen t from house to  house waki ng up the sleepers to go to mass but b efore a year  
was out he too was conquered by the negligence that one brea thed in with the air, by the hot dust 
that mad e everything old and clogged up, and by the drowsiness caused by lunchtime meatballs in 
the unbearab le heat of siesta time. 
With Úrsula’s death the house again fell into a ne glect from which it could not be rescued even 
by a will as r esolute and vigorous as that of Amar anta Úrsula, who many years later, being a happy,  
modern woman without prejudices, with her f eet on the ground, opened doors and windows in 
order to drive away th e rain, restored the ga rden, exterminated the red  ants who were already  
walking acro ss the porch in broad da ylight, and t ried in vain to reawaken  the forgotten spirit of 
hospitality. Fernanda’s cloistered passion built in  impenetrable dike against Úrsula’s torrential 
hundred yea rs. Not only did she refuse to open d oors when the arid wind passed thro ugh, but she 
had the wind ows nailed s hut with  boards in the sh ape of a cros s, obeying the paternal or der of being 
buried alive. The expensive correspondence with the invisible doctors  ended in f ailure. After 
 168GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
numerous postponements, she shut herself up in her room on the date and hour agreed upon,  
covered only by a whi te sheet and  with her head p ointed north , and at one o’clock in th e morning 
she felt that they were co vering he r head with a handkerchief soak ed in a glacial liquid. When she 
woke up the sun was shining in the window and  she had a b arbarous stitch in the sh ape of an ar c 
that began a t her crotch and ended a t her sternum. But before she could complete th e prescribed  
rest she received a disturbed letter from the in visible doctors, who mid th ey had inspected her for 
six hours without finding anything that corresponded to the symptoms so many times and so 
scrupulously described by her. Actually, her pernic ious habit of not calling things by their names had 
brought about a new con fusion, for the only thing th at the telep athic surgeons had found was a drop  
in the uterus which could be corrected by the use  of a pessary. The disillus ioned Fernanda tried to 
obtain more precise info rmation, but the unkno wn correspon dents did no t answer her  letters any 
more. She felt so defeated by the weight of an unknown word  that she decided to put s hame behind 
her and ask what a pessa ry was, and  only then  did she discov er that the French doctor  had hang ed 
himself to a beam three months earli er and had b een buried a gainst the wi shes of the townspeople 
by a former companion in arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Then she confided in her son José  
Arcadio and the latter sen t her the pessaries from Rome along with a pamphl et explaining their use, 
which she flushed down  the toilet after committing it to memory so that no one would learn th e 
nature of her troubles. It was a useless precauti on because the only people who lived in the house  
scarcely p aid any atten tion to h er. Santa Sofía de la Piedad wa s wandering about in h er solitary old  
age, cooking the little th at th ey ate and almost co mpletely d edicated to the care of José Arcadio  
Segundo. Amaranta Úrsula, who had inherited certai n attracti ons of Remedios the Bea uty, spent th e 
time that she had formerly wasted tormenting Úrsula at her schoolwork, and she began to show 
good judgment and a dedication to s tudy that br ought back to Aureliano Segundo the high hopes  
that Meme had inspired i n him. He had promised he r to send her to finish her studies i n Brussels, in 
accord with  a custom  established du ring the ti me of the banana company, and that illusion had  
brought him to attempt to revive the lands devasta ted by the deluge. The few times that he appeared 
at the house were for Amaranta Úrs ula, because with time he had becom e a stranger to Fernan da 
and little Aureliano was becoming wi thdrawn as he approached puberty. Aureliano Segundo had  
faith that Fernanda’s heart would soften with old ag e so that the child could join in the life of the 
town where no one certainly would make any effort  to speculate suspiciously about his origins. But  
Aureliano himself seemed to prefer the cloister o f solitude and he did not show the l east desire to  
know the world that began at the street door of the house. When Úrsula had the door of 
Melquíades’ room opened he began to linger about it, peeping through the half-opened door, and no  
one knew at what mom ent he becam e close to Jo sé Arcadio Segundo in a link of mutual affection. 
Aureliano Segundo discovered that friendship a l ong time after it had  begun, when he heard  the 
child talking about the killing at the station.  It happened once when someone at the table 
complained about the ruin into which  the town ha d sunk when the banana company ha d abandoned  
it, and Aureliano contradi cted him with maturity a nd with the vision of a grown person. His point of 
view, contrar y to the general interpreta tion, was that Macondo had been a pr osperous place and  well 
on its way u ntil it was disordered and corrupted and suppressed by the b anana comp any, whose 
engineers brought on the deluge as a pretext to avoi d promises made to the workers. Speaking with  
such good sense tha t to Fernanda he was like a  sacrilegious parody of Jews  among the wise men, th e 
child described with precise and conv incing details how the army had m achine-gunned more tha n 
three thousa nd workers penned up by the statio n and how they loaded the bodies onto a two-
hundred-car train and t hrew them into the sea.  Convinced as most people were by the official  
version that nothing ha d happened, Fernanda was scandalized with th e idea that the child had  
inherited the anarchist ideas of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and told him to be quiet. Aureliano 
Segundo, on the other hand, recognized his twin brothe r’s version. Actu ally, in spite of the fact tha t 
 169GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
everyone co nsidered him mad, José Arcadio Segundo was at that time the most lucid inhabitant of 
the house. He taught li ttle Aureliano how to r ead and write, initiated  him in the study of the  
parchments, and he inculcated him wi th such a personal interpretation of what the bana na company 
had meant to Macondo that many years later, when Aureliano became part of the world, one would  
have thought that he was telling a hallucinated vers ion, because it was radically opposed to the fals e 
one that his torians had created and consecrated in the schoolbooks. In the small isolated room 
where the ari d air never penetrated, no r the dust, nor  the heat, both had the atavistic vision of an old 
man, his back to the window, wearing a hat with a brim like t he wings of a crow who spoke abou t 
the world m any years bef ore they had been born. Both  described at the sam e time how it was always  
March there and always Monday, and then they understood that José Arcadio Buendía was not as 
crazy as the family said, but that h e was the only one who ha d enough lucidity to sens e the truth o f 
the fact tha t time also stumbled an d had accidents and co uld therefore splinter and leave an 
eternalized fragment in a room. José Arcadio Segu ndo had managed, furtherm ore, to classify the 
cryptic letters of the parchments. He was certain  that they corresponded to an alphabet of forty-
seven to fifty-three char acters, which when sep arated looked like scratching and scribbling, and 
which in th e fine hand  of Melquíades looked like pieces o f clothing put out to  dry on a line.  
Aureliano remembered h aving seen a  similar table in the Engli sh encyclop edia, so he br ought it to 
the room to compare it with that of José Arcadio S egundo. They were indeed the same. 
Around the time of the riddle lottery, Aureliano Segundo began waking up with a knot in his 
throat, as if he were repressing a desire to weep. Petra Cotes interpreted it as one more of so many 
upsets brought on by t he bad situation, and ev ery morning for over a year she would touch his  
palate with a  dash of honey and give him some radish  syrup. When the knot in his throat became s o 
oppressive that it was di fficult for him to breathe,  Aureliano Segundo visited Pilar Ternera to see i f 
she knew of  some herb that would give him relie f. The dauntl ess grandmother, who had reached a 
hundred years of age managing a small, clandestin e brothel, did not trust therapeutic s uperstitions, 
so she turned the matter over to her  cards. She saw the queen  of diamonds with h er throat wound ed 
by the steel of the jack o f spades, and  she dedu ced that Fernanda was trying to get her h usband back  
home by means of the discredited method of sticking  pins into his picture but that she had brought 
on an internal tumor because of her clumsy knowledge of the black arts. Since Aureliano Segundo 
had no o ther pictures ex cept those o f his weddin g and the co pies were all in the family album, h e 
kept searchi ng all through the h ouse when his wife was not lo oking, and finally, in the bottom of th e 
dresser, he came across a half-doz en pessaries in their original boxes. Thinking that the small red 
rubber rings were objects  of witchcraft he put them in  his pocket so that P ilar Ternera could have a  
look at them. She could not determin e their natur e, but they looked so suspicious to her that in an y 
case she burned them in a bonfire she built in th e courtyard. In order to conjure away Fernanda’s 
alleged curse, she told Aureliano Segundo that he should soak a  broody hen and bury her alive under 
the ch estnut tree, and  he did it wi th such good fa ith that when he finis hed hiding the turned-up 
earth with dried leaves he already felt that he was breathing better. For her part, Fernanda  
interpreted the disappear ance as a rep risal by the in visible doctors and she sewed a pocket of casing 
to the inside of her camisole where sh e kept the n ew pessaries that her son s ent her. 
Six months after he had  buried the hen, Aureliano  Segundo woke up a t midnight with an a ttack  
of coughing and the feeling that he was being stra ngled within by the claws of a crab. It was then 
that he und erstood that for all of the magical pessa ries that he destroyed an d all the con juring hens 
that h e soak ed, the singl e and s ad piece of truth  was that he was d ying. He did not tell anyon e. 
Tormented by the fear of dying without having se nt Amaranta Úrsula to Brussels, he worked as he  
had never done, and instead of one he made three weekly raffles. From very early in the morning he 
could be seen going through the town, even in th e most outlying and miserable section s, trying to  
sell tickets with an  anx iety th at could only be conceivable in a d ying man. “Her e’s Divine 
 170GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Providence,” he hawked. “Don’t let it get away, b ecause it o nly comes every hundred years.” He 
made pitiful efforts to appear gay,  pleasant, talkative, but it wa s enough to see his sweat and pal eness 
to know that his heart was not in it. Sometimes he  would go to vacant lots, where no one could see 
him, and sit down to rest from the claws that wer e tearing him apart inside. Even at midnight he 
would be in the red-light district tryin g to consol e with predictions of good luck the lon ely wom en 
who were weeping beside their phonographs. “This numb er hasn’t come up in four months,” he 
told them, s howing them the tickets. “Don’t let it  get away,  life is shorter  than you think.” They 
finally lost respect for him, made fun  of him, and in his last m onths they n o longer called him Don  
Aureliano, as they had always done, but they called him Mr. Divine Providence right to his face. His 
voice was  becoming filled with wrong  notes. It was  getting out of tune , and  it finally diminished into 
the growl of a dog, but he still had the drive to s ee that there should be no diminishing of the hope 
people brought to Petra Cates’s courtyard. As he lost  his voice, however, and realized th at in a shor t 
time he wou ld be unable to bear the pain, he began to understand that it was not through raffled 
pigs and goats that his daughter would get to Brussels, so he conceived the idea of organizing the 
fabulous raffle of the lands destroyed  by the deluge, which cou ld easily be restored by a person with 
the money to do so. It was such a s pectacular u ndertaking that the mayor himself lent his aid by 
announcing it in a proclamation, and associations were formed to buy tickets at one hu ndred pesos  
apiece and  they were sol d out in less than a week . The night of the raffle the winners held a huge 
celebration, comparable only to thos e of the g ood days of the banana company, and Aureliano 
Segundo, for the last time, played the forgotten songs of Francisco the Man on the accordion, but 
he could no longer sing them. 
Two months later Amaranta Úrsula went to Brussels. Aureliano Segundo gave her not only the 
money from the special ra ffle, but also what he had managed to put aside ov er the previous months  
and what little he had received from the sale of th e pianola, the clavichord, and other junk that had  
fallen into disrepair.  According to his calculatio ns, that sum would be enough for her studies, so 
that all that was lacking was the price of her fare back home. Fernanda wa s against the trip until the  
last moment, scandalized by the idea that Brussels was so close to Paris and its perdition, but she 
calmed do wn with the l etter th at Father Angel ga ve her addressed to a bo ardinghouse run by nuns  
for Catholic young ladies where Am aranta Úrsula promised to stay until her  studies were completed . 
Furthermore, the parish priest arranged for her to  travel under the care of  a group of Franciscan 
nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to  find dependable people to accompany her to 
Belgium. While the urgent correspondence that made the coordination possible went forward,  
Aureliano Segundo, aided by Petra Cates, prepared  Amaranta  Úrsula’s baggage. The night on which  
they were p acking one of Fernanda’s bridal trunks, the thi ngs were so  well organized th at th e 
schoolgirl knew by heart which were the suits and  cloth slipper s she could wear crossing the Atlanti c 
and the blue cloth coat with copper  buttons an d the cordovan shoes s he would wear when she 
landed. She also knew how to walk so as not to fall into the water as she went up the gangplank, that 
at no time was she to leave the company of the nuns or leave her cabin except to eat, a nd that for no 
reason was  she to answer the qu estions asked b y people of any sex while th ey were at sea. She 
carried a small bottle with drops for seasickness a nd a notebo ok written by Father An gel in his own  
hand containing six prayers to be used  against stor ms. Fernanda made her a  canvas bel t to keep h er 
money in, and she would not have to take it off even to sleep. She tried to give her the chamberpot, 
washed out with lye and  disinfected with alcohol, bu t Amaran ta Úrsula refused it for fear that her  
schoolmates  would make fun of he r. A few m onths  later, at the hour of his deat h, Aureliano 
Segundo would rememb er her as he had seen  her for the la st time as s he tried uns uccessfully to 
lower the window of the second-class coach to hea r Fernanda’s last piece of advice. She was wearing  
a pink silk d ress with a corsage of artificial pans ies pinned to her left shou lder, her cor dovan shoes 
with buckles  and low heels, and sateen stockings held  up at th e thighs with  elastic garters. Her body 
 171GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
was slim, her hair loose and long, and she had the lively eyes th at Úrsula had had at her age and the 
way in which she said good-bye, w ithout crying  but without smiling e ither, revealed the same 
strength of character. Wa lking beside the coa ch as it picked up  speed and h olding Fernanda by th e 
arm so that she would not stumble, Aureliano scarcely had tim e to wave at his daughter as she threw 
him a kiss with the tips of her fingers. The couple stood motionless under the scorching sun, 
looking at th e train as it merged with  the black st rip of the ho rizon, linking arms for the first tim e 
since the da y of their wedding. 
On the ninth  of August, before they received the first letter from Brussels, José Arcadio Segundo 
was speak ing to Aureliano  in Melquíades’ room and, without real izing it, he said: 
“Always remember that they were mo re than three thousand and that they were thrown  into the 
sea.” 
Then he fell  back on th e parchmen ts and died wi th his eyes open. At that same instant, in 
Fernanda’s bed, his twin brother came to the en d of the prol onged and terrible martyrdom of the 
steel crabs  that were ea ting his throat a way. On e week previously he had  retur ned home, without any 
voice, unable to breathe,  and almost skin and b ones, with his wandering trunks and his wastrel’s 
accordion, to fulfill the promise of dying beside his wife. Pe tra Cotes hel ped him pack his clothes  
and bade hi m farewell without shedd ing a tear, b ut she forgot to  give him the paten t leather sho es 
that h e wanted to wear i n his coffin. So when  she heard that he had died, she dress ed in black, 
wrapped the shoes up in a  newspaper, and asked Fe rnanda for permission to see the body.  Fernanda 
would not let her through the door. 
“Put yourself in my place,” Petra Cotes begged.  “Imagine how much I must have loved him to 
put up with this humiliation.” 
“There is no  humiliation that a concubine does not deserve,” Fernanda re plied. “So wait until 
another one of your men dies  and put the shoes on him.” 
In fulfillmen t of her pro mise, Santa Sofía de la Piedad cut the throat of Jo sé Arcadio Segundo’s 
corpse with a kitchen knife to be sure that they wo uld not bury him alive. The bodies were placed in 
identical coffins, and then it could be seen that once more in death they had  become as Identical a s 
they h ad been until adolescence. Aureliano Segundo’ s old caro using comrades laid on his casket a  
wreath that had a purple ribbon with the words: Cease, cows, life is short . Fernanda was so indignant  
with such irreverence tha t she had the wreath thrown onto the trash heap. In the tumult of the last 
moment, the sad drunkards who carried them out of the house got the coffins mixed up and buried  
them in the wrong graves. 
 172GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Chapter 18 
AURELIA NO DID  NOT  leave Melquíades’ room for a long time. He lear ned by heart the fantasti c 
legends of the crumbling books, the synthesis of  the studies of Hermann the Cripple,  the notes on 
the science of demonology, the k eys to the philosopher’s stone, the Centuries of Nostradamus and hi s 
research con cerning the plague, so that he reac hed adolescence without kn owing a thing about his  
own time bu t with  the ba sic knowledge of a m edieval  man. An y time tha t Santa Sofía de la Piedad  
would go into his room s he would fin d him absor bed in his reading. At da wn she would bring him a 
mug of coffee without s ugar and at noon a plate of rice and slices of frie d plantain, which were th e 
only things eaten in the h ouse since the death  of Aureliano Segundo. She saw tha t his h air was cut,  
picked off the nits, took in to his size the old cloth ing that she found in forgotten trunks, and when  
his mustache began to appear the br ought hi m Colonel Aur eliano Buendía’s razor and the small 
gourd he had used as a shaving mug. None of the la tter’s children had looked so much like him, not 
even Aureliano José, particularly in respect to the prominent cheekbones  and the firm and rather  
pitiless line of the lips. As had hap pened to Úrsula with Aureliano Segundo when the latter wa s 
studying in the room, S anta Sofía d e la Piedad  thought tha t Aureliano was talking to himself. 
Actually, he was talking to Melquíades. One burni ng noon, a s hort time after the death of the twins, 
against the light of the window he saw the gl oomy old ma n with his crow’s-wing hat like the 
materializati on of a memory that had  been in his head since long before he was born. Aureliano had 
finished classifying the alphabet of th e parchmen ts, so that when Melquíades asked hi m if he had  
discovered the language in which they had b een wr itten he did not hesitate to answer. 
“Sanskrit, ” he said. 
Melquíades revealed to him that his opportunities  to return to the room were limited. But he 
would go in peace to th e meadows of the ultima te death b ecaus e Aureliano would have time to lear n 
Sanskrit during the years remaining until the parc hments beca me one hun dred years old, when they 
could be deciphered. It was he who indicated to Aureliano that on the narrow street going down to 
the river, where dreams  had been i nterpreted d uring the time of the banana com pany, a wise 
Catalonian had a bookstore where there was a Sanskr it primer, which would be eaten by the moths  
within six years if he did not hurry to buy it. For the first time in her long life Santa Sofía de la  
Piedad let a feeling show through, and it was  a feeling of wonderment when Aureliano asked her to  
bring him t he book that could be found between Jerusalem Delivered and Milton’s poems on the 
extreme right-hand side of the second shelf of  the bookcases.  Since she could not read, she memo-
rized what he had said and got some money by sellin g one of the seventeen little gold fishes left in 
the workshop, the whereabouts of which, after be ing hidden the night the soldiers searched the 
house, was known only by her and Au reliano. 
Aureliano made progress in his studies of Sanskrit  as Melquíades’ visits became less and less 
frequent and he was more distant, fading away in the radiant light of noon. The last time th at 
Aureliano sensed him he was only an invisible pr esence who  murmured: “I died of fever on th e 
sands of Singapore.” The room then became vuln erable to dus t, heat, termi tes, red ants,  and moths, 
who would turn the wisdom of the pa rchments into sawdust. 
There was no shortage of food in the  house. The day after the death of Aureliano Segundo, one 
of the friends who had  brought the wreath with  the irreverent i nscription offered to pay Fernanda 
some money that he had owed her husband. After  that every Wednesday a delivery boy brought a 
basket of food that was quite sufficient for a week.  No one ever knew th at those pro visions were 
being sent by Petra Cotes with the idea that th e continuing charity was a way of humiliating the  
person who had humiliated her. Neve rtheless, the rancor disappeared  much sooner than she hersel f 
 173GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
had expected, and then she continued sending the f ood out of pride and fina lly out of compassion . 
Several times, when she h ad no animals to raffle off and people lost interest in the lottery, she went 
without food so that Fer nanda could have someth ing to eat,  and she continued fulfillin g the pledge 
to herself until she saw Fernanda’s funeral procession pass by. 
For Santa Sofía de la Piedad the redu ction in the number of inhabitants of the house shou ld hav e 
meant the rest she deserved after more than half a century of work. Never a lament had been heard  
from that stealthy, impenetrable wo man who ha d sown in the family the angelic seed of Remedios  
the Beau ty and the mysterious solemnity of José Arcadio Segundo; who dedicated  a whole life of  
solitude and diligence to the rearing o f children alt hough she c ould barely remember whether they 
were her children or grandchildren, and who took ca re of Aureliano as if he had come out of he r 
womb, not knowing herself that she was his great- grandmother. Only in a house like that was it 
conceiv able for her always to sleep o n a mat she laid out on the pantry floor in the midst of the 
nocturnal noise of the ra ts, and without telling anyone that one night she had awakened with the 
frightened feeling that someone was looking at he r in the darkness and that it was a poisonous snake 
crawling over her stomach. She knew that if she had told Úrsula, the latter would have made her  
sleep in her own bed, but those were times when no one was aware of anything unless it was 
shouted on the porch, because wi th the bustle of the bakery, th e surprises of the war, th e care of the 
children, there was not much room for thinking about other peoples happiness. Petra Cotes who m 
she had never seen, was the only one who remem bered he r. She saw to it that she had a good pair of 
shoes for street wear, th at she always had clothi ng, even during the times when the raffles were 
working only through some miracle. When Fernanda  arrived at the h ouse she had go od reason to  
think that sh e was an ageless servant, and even th ough she heard it said several times that she was 
her husband’s mother it was so incredible that it took her longer to discover it than to forget it. 
Santa Sofía de la Piedad never seemed bothered by that lowly po sition. On the contrary, one had the 
impression that she liked to s tay in th e corners, without a  paus e, without a complaint, k eeping clea n 
and in order  the im mens e house that she had  lived in ever si nce adoles cence and  that, especially 
during the time of the b anana co mpany, was mo re like a barracks than a  home. But when Úrsula  
died the superhuman diligence of Santa Sofía de la  Piedad, her tremendous capacity for work, began 
to fall apart.  It was not only that she was old and exhausted, but overnight the house had plunged 
into a crisis of senility. A soft moss grew up the walls. When there was no longer a bare spot in th e 
courtyard, th e weeds bro ke through the cemen t of the porch, breaking it like glass, and out of the 
cracks grew the same yell ow flowers that Úrsula had found in the glass with Melquíades’ false teeth a  
century befo re. With neither the tim e nor the res ources to hal t the challen ge of nature, Santa Sofía 
de la Piedad spent the da y in the bedrooms drivin g out the liz ards who would return at night. One 
morning she saw that the red ants had left the undermined foundations, crossed the garden, climbed 
up the railing, where the begonias had taken on an earthen color, and had penetrated into the heart  
of the house. She first tried to kill them with a broom,  then with insecticides, and finally with lye, bu t 
the next day they were b ack in the sa me place, sti ll passing by, tenacious a nd invincible. Fernanda, 
writing letters to her children, was not aware of th e unchecked  destructive attack. Santa  Sofía de la  
Piedad conti nued struggling alone, fighting the weeds to s top them from g etting into the kitchen,  
pulling from  the walls the tassels of s pider webs wh ich were rebuilt in a few hours, scraping off the  
termites. But when she saw that Melquíades’ room was also dusty and filled with cobwebs even  
though she swept and  dusted three times a da y, an d that in spite of her furious cle aning it was 
threaten ed by the debris and the air of misery that had b een foreseen only by Colonel Aureliano 
Buendía and the young officer, she realized that sh e was defeated. Then she put on her worn Sunday 
dress, some old shoes of Úrsula’s, an d a pair of  cotton stocki ngs that Amaranta Úrsula had given 
her, and she made a bund le out of the two or three changes of clothing that s he had left. 
“I give up,” she said to Aureliano. “T his is too much house for my poor bones.” 
 174GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Aureliano asked her where she was going and she made a vague sign, as if she did not have th e 
slightest idea of her destination. She tried to be more precise, however, saying that she was going to  
spend her last years with  a first cousin who lived in Riohacha. It was not a  likely explanation. Since  
the death o f her parents she had not had contact with anyone in town or received letters or  
messages, nor had she been heard to speak of any relatives. Aureliano gave her fourteen little gold 
fishes because she was determined to leave with on ly what she had: one peso and twenty-five cents. 
From the window of the room he saw her cross the courtyard with her bundle of clothing, dragging 
her feet and bent over b y her years, a nd he s aw her reach her hand through an op ening in the mai n 
door and replace the b ar after she had gone out. Nothing was ever heard of her again. 
When she heard about the flight, Fe rnanda rant ed for a whole day as s he checked trunks, 
dressers, and closets, item  by item, to  make sure th at Santa Sofí a de la Piedad had not made off with 
anything. She burned her fingers trying to light a fi re for the first time in her life and she had to ask  
Aureliano to do her the favor of showing her how  to make coffee. Fernanda would find her 
breakfast ready when sh e arose and  she would le ave her room again only to get the meal tha t 
Aureliano had left covered on the embers for her, wh ich she would carry to the table to eat on linen  
tablecloths a nd between candelabra, sitting at the solitary head of the table facing fifteen empty 
chairs. Even under those circumstances Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their solitude, but 
both continu ed living on their own, cl eaning their respective ro oms while th e cobwebs fell like snow 
on the rose bushes, carp eted the bea ms, cushioned th e walls. I t was around  that time th at Fer nanda 
got the impr ession that the house was filling up with elves. It was as if things, especially those for 
everyday use, had develo ped a faculty for changi ng location on their own. Fernanda would waste  
time looking for the shea rs that sh e was sure sh e had put on the bed  and after turning everything 
upside down  she would find them on a shelf in the kitchen, wh ere she thou ght she had not been for  
four days. Suddenly there was no fork in the silv er chest and she would find six on the altar and  
three in the washroom. That wander ing about of things was even more exasperating when she sa t 
down to write. The inkwell that she h ad placed at  her right would be on the left, the blotter would  
be lost and  she would find it two days  later unde r her pillow, and the pages written to J osé Arcadi o 
would get mixed up with those wr itten to Am aranta Úrsula, and she a lways had the feeling of 
mortification that she had put the letters in opposi te envelopes, as in fact happened s everal times.  
On one occa sion she lost her fountain pen. Two weeks later the mailman, who had found it in his 
bag, returne d it. He had been going from house to  house looking for its owne r. At first she thought 
it was some business of t he invisible doctors, lik e the disappearance of the pessaries, and she even 
started a l etter to them b egging them to leave h er alone, but sh e had to  interrupt it to d o something  
and when she went back to her room she not only di d not find the letter she had started but she had  
forgotten th e reason for  writing it. For a time sh e thought i t was Aurelian o. She bega n to sp y on 
him, to put things in his path trying to catch hi m when he cha nged their location, but s he was soon  
convinced that Aureliano never left Melquíades’ room  except to go to the kitchen or th e toilet, and 
that he was not a man to play tricks. So in the en d she believed that it was the mischief of elves and 
she decided  to secure everything in th e place wher e she would use it. She tied the shears  to th e head 
of her bed with a long string. She tied the pen and  the blotter to the leg of the table, an d the glued 
the inkwell to the top of  it to the right of the pla ce where sh e normally wrote. The pro blems were 
not solved o vernight, because a few h ours after she ha d tied  the string to th e shears it was not long  
enough for her to cut with, as if the elves had s hortened it. The same thing happened to her with the 
string to the pen and even with her own arm which after a short time of writing could not reach the 
inkwell. Neither Amaranta Úrsula in Brussels nor José Arcadio in Rome ever heard about those 
insignificant misfortunes. Fernanda told them th at she was h appy and in reality she was, precisely 
because she felt free from any comp romise, as if  life were pull ing her once more to ward the world 
of her parents, where one did not suffer with day-to-day problems beca use they were solved  
 175GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
beforehand in one’s imagination. That endless  correspondence mad e her lose her sense of time,  
especially after Santa Sofía de la Piedad had left. She had been accustom ed to keep track  of the days, 
months, and years, using as points of reference the da tes set for the return of  her children . But when  
they changed their plans time and time again, the dates beca me confused, the periods were mislaid, 
and one day seemed so much like another that o ne could not feel them p ass. Instead of becoming 
impatient, s he felt a deep pleasure in the dela y. It did not worry her that many years after  
announcing the eve of hi s final vows, José Arcadi o wa s still saying that he was waiting to finish his 
studies in advanced theol ogy in order to undertak e those in diplomacy, because she understood how 
steep and p aved with obs tacles was th e spiral stairw ay th at led to the thron e of Saint Peter. On the 
other hand, her spirits rose with news  that would have been insignificant for other people, such a s 
the fact that her son had seen the Pope. She felt a similar pleasure when Amaranta Úrsula wrote to  
tell her that her studies would last  longer than the time foreseen because her excellen t grades had 
earned her p rivileges that her father had not  taken into account in his calculations. 
More than three years had passed since Santa So fía de la Pie dad had brought him the grammar 
when Aureli ano succeed ed in translating the first sh eet. It was  not a us eless chore. but it was only a  
first step along a road whose length it was impossi ble to predict, because th e text in Spa nish did not 
mean anythi ng: the lines were in code. Aureliano lack ed the m eans to estab lish the keys that would 
permit him to dig them out, but since Melquíades had told him that the bo oks he needed to get to  
the bottom of the parch ments were i n the wise C atalonian’s store, he decided to sp eak to Fernan da 
so that she would let him get them. In the room devoured by rubble, whose unchecked proliferation  
had finally defeated it, h e thought a bout the b est way to frame the requ est, but when he foun d 
Fernanda taking her meal from the embers, which was his only chance to speak to her, the 
laboriously formulated request stuck i n his throat and he lost his voice. That was the o nly time th at 
he watched her. He listened to her steps in the bedroom. He heard her on her way to the door to 
await th e letters from her children and to give hers to the mailman, and he listened until late at night 
to the harsh, impassioned scratching of her pen on the paper before hearing the sound of the light 
switch and  the murmur of her prayer s in the d arkness.  Only then did he go to sleep,  trusting that o n 
the following day the awaited opportunity would come . He became so inspired with the idea that 
permission would be gra nted th at on e morning he cut his hair , which a t that tim e reach ed down to  
his shoulders, shaved off his tangled beard, put on some tig ht-fitting pants and a  shirt with an  
artificial collar that he h ad inherited from he did not know whom, and waited in th e kitchen for  
Fernanda to get her break fast. The wo man of ever y day, th e one with h er head held hig h and with a 
stony gait, did not arrive, but an old woman of s upernatural beauty with a yellowed ermine cape, a  
crown of gilded cardboar d, and the languid look of  a person who wept in s ecret. Actually, ever since 
she had found it in Aureliano Segundo’s trunks, Fe rnanda had put on th e moth-eaten  queen’s dress 
many times. Anyone who  could have seen her in fr ont of the mirror, in ecstasy over her own regal 
gestures, would have had reason to think that she was mad. But she was no t. She had simply turned  
the royal  regalia into a  device for her memory. Th e first time that she put i t on sh e coul d not h elp a 
knot from forming in  her heart and her eyes filling  with tears because at that moment she smelled 
once more the odor of shoe polish on the boots of the office r who came to get her at her house to 
make her a q ueen, and her soul brightened with th e nos talgia of her lost dreams. She felt so old, so 
worn out, so far away from the best moments of her life that she even yearned for those that she 
remembered  as the worst, and only then did she discover how much she missed the whiff of 
oregano on the porch and the smell of the roses at d usk, and even the bestial  nature of the parvenus. 
Her heart of compressed ash, which had resisted the most telling blow s of daily re ality without  
strain, fell apart with the first waves of nostalgia. The need to  feel sad was becoming a vice as th e 
years eroded  her. She became hu man in her solitude. Nevertheless, the morning on which she 
entered the kitchen and found a cup of coffee o ffered her by a pale and  bony adolescent with a 
 176GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
hallucinated  glow in his eyes, th e claws of ridicu le tore at her. Not o nly did she refuse him 
permission, but from th en on she ca rried the keys to th e hou se in the po cket wh ere s he kept the 
unused pessaries. It was a useless precaution beca use if he h ad wan ted to, Aureliano could ha ve 
escaped and  even returned to the house withou t being seen. But the prolonged captivity, th e 
uncertainty of the world, the habi t of obedience had dried up the seeds  of rebellion in his heart. So 
that he wen t back to his enclosure, reading and re reading the par chments and  listening until very late 
at night to F ernanda sobbing in her bedroom. One morning he went to lig ht the fire as usual and on 
the extinguished ashes he found the food that he had left for her the day before. Then he looked  
into her bed room and saw her lying on the bed cove red with the ermine cape, more b eautiful than 
ever and with her skin turned into an ivory casing . Four months later, when José Arcadio arrived, he 
found her intact. 
It was impo ssible to con ceive of a m an more like his mother.  He was  wearing a somber taffeta  
suit, a shirt with a round  and hard collar, and a thin silk ribbon tied in a bow in place of a necktie.  
He was ruddy and languid with a startled look and weak lips. His black hair, shiny  and smooth,  
parted in the middle of hi s head by a straight and tired line, had the sam e artificial appeara nce as  the 
hair on the saints. The shadow of a well-uprooted  beard on his paraffin face looked like  a question 
of conscience. His hands were pale, with green veins and fingers that were like parasites, and he 
wore a solid gold ring w ith a round sunflower opal on his le ft index finger. When he opened the 
street door Aureliano did not have to be told who he was  to realize th at he came fr om far away. 
With his steps the house filled up with the fragran ce of the toilet water that Úrsula used to splash on 
him when h e was a child in order to find him in the shadows, in some way impossible to ascertain,  
after so many years of absence. José Arcadio was still an autumnal child, terribly sad and solitary. He 
went directl y to his moth er’s bedroom, where Au reliano had boiled mercury for four months in his 
grandfather’s grandfather’s water pipe to conserve  the bod y according to Melquíades’ formula. José 
Arcadio did not ask him any question s. He kissed the corpse on the forehead and withdrew from 
under her skirt the pocket of casing which containe d three as yet unused pessaries and the key to h er 
cabinet. He did everythin g with di rect and decisive movements, in c ontrast to his languid look. From 
the cabinet he took a s mall damascene ches t with the family crest and found on the inside, which 
was perfumed with sandalwood, the long letter in which Fernanda unburdened her heart of th e 
numerous truths that she had hidden from him. He read it stan ding up, avidly but with out anxiety,  
and at the thi rd page he stopped and examined Aureliano with a look of second recognition. 
“So,” he said with a voice with a touch  of razor in it, “You’re the bastard.” 
“I’m Aureliano Buendía.” 
“Go to your room,” José Arcadio said. 
Aureliano went and  did not come ou t again even fr om curiosity when  he h eard the sou nd of the 
solitary funeral ceremonies. Sometimes, from th e kitchen, he would see José Arcadio strollin g 
through the house, smothered by his  anxious breath ing, and he continued hearing his steps in the 
ruined bedrooms after midnight. He did not hear his voice for many months, not only because Jos é 
Arcadio never addressed him, but also because he had no desire for it to happen or time to think  
about anythi ng else but the parchmen ts. On Fernanda ’s death he had taken out the next-to-the-last 
little fish and gone to the wise Catalonian’s bookst ore in search of the books he needed. Nothing he 
saw along th e way interes ted him, p erhaps because he la cked a ny mem ories for comparison and t he 
deserted streets and deso late houses were the sa me as he ha d imagined them at a ti me when he 
would have given his soul to know them. He had  given himself the permis sion denied by Fernanda 
and only once and for the minimum time necess ary, so without pausing he went alo ng the eleven  
blocks that s eparated the house from the narrow st reet where d reams had b een interpreted in other  
days and he went panti ng into the confused and gloomy place where there was ba rely room to 
move. More than a bookstore, it looked like a dum p for used books, which were placed in disorder 
 177GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
on the sh elves chewed b y termites, in the corners st icky with  cobwebs, and  even in the spaces th at 
were suppos ed to serve as passageways. On a long ta ble, also heaped with ol d books and papers, the 
proprietor was writing tireless prose in purple lett ers, somewh at outlandish , and on the loose pages 
of a school notebook. He had a hands ome head  of silver hair which fell down over his forehead like 
the plume o f a cockatoo , and his blue eyes, lively and close-set, revealed the gentleness of a ma n 
who had read all of the books. He was wearing short pants and soaking in perspiration, and he di d 
not stop his writing to se e who had come in. Aure liano had no difficulty in rescuing the five books 
that he was looking for from that fabulous diso rder, because they were ex actly where Melquíades  
had told him they would be. Without saying a wor d he handed  them,  along with the little gold fish,  
to the wise Catalonian a nd the latter examined th em, his eyelids contracting like two clams. “You 
must be mad,” he said in his own language, sh rugging his shoulders, and he handed back to 
Aureliano the five books and the little fish. 
“You can h ave them” h e said in Span ish. “The last man  who  read th ese b ooks must ha ve been  
Isaac the Bli ndman, so consider well what you’re doing.” 
José Arcadio restored Meme’s bedroom and had the velvet cu rtains cleaned and m ended along  
with the damask on the canopy of the viceregal be d, and he put to use once more the abandoned  
bathroom where the cement pool was blackened  by a fibrous and rough coating. He restricted his 
vest-pocket empire of worn, exotic clothing, fals e perfumes, and cheap jewelry to tho se places. Th e 
only thing that seemed to worry hi m in the res t of the hou se were the saints on th e family alta r, 
which he bu rned down to ashes one afternoon in a bonfire he lighted in the courtyard . He would  
sleep until p ast eleven  o’clock. He would go to th e bathroom in a shabby r obe with go lden dragon s 
on it and a pair of slippers with yellow tassels, and there he wou ld officiate at a rite which for its care 
and length r ecalled Remedios the B eauty. Before bathing he would perfume the pool with the salts 
that h e carried in three ala baster flacon s. He di d not bath e hims elf with the gourd but would plunge 
into the fragrant waters a nd remain there for two hours floating on his bac k, lulled by t he coolnes s 
and by the memory of Amaranta. A few days after arriving he put aside his taffeta s uit, which in  
addition to b eing too hot for the town  was th e onl y one that h e had, and h e exchanged it for som e 
tight-fitting pants very similar to those worn by Pietro Crespi during his dance lessons and a silk 
shirt woven with thread from livin g caterpillars and with his initials embroidered over the heart.  
Twice a week he would wash the co mplete ch ange in  the tub  and would wear his robe until it dried 
because he had nothing else to put on. He never ate at home.  He would go out when the hea t of 
siesta time had eased an d would not return until well into the night. Then he would continue his  
anxious pacing, breathing like a cat and thinking a bout Amara nta. She and the frightful look of the 
saints in the glow of the nocturnal lamp were the two memor ies he retained of the house. Many 
times during the hallucinating Roman August he had opened his eyes in the middle of his sleep and 
had seen Amaranta rising out of a marble-edged  pool with her lace petticoats and the bandage on 
her hand, idealized by th e anxiety of exile. Unlike Aureliano José who tried to drown that image i n 
the bloody b og of war, he tried to keep it alive in  the sink of concupiscence while he entertained his 
mother with the endless  fable of his pontifical vo cation. It never occurred either to him or to 
Fernanda to think that their correspondence was  an exchange of fantasies. José Arcadio, who left  
the seminary as soon as  he reached Rome, conti nued nourishing the legend of theology and canon 
law so as not to jeopardize the fabulous inheritan ce of which his mother’s delirious letters spoke and 
which would rescue him from the misery and sordid ness he shared with two  friends in a Trastevere 
garret. When he received Fernanda’s last letter, dict ated by the f oreboding of imminent d eath, he pu t 
the leftovers  of his false splendor into a suitcase and crossed the ocean  in the hold of a ship wh ere 
immigrants were cramm ed together l ike cattle in a slaughterhouse, eating cold macaro ni and worm y 
cheese. B efore he read  Fernanda’s wil l, which wa s nothing but a detailed an d tardy recap itulation of  
her misfortunes, the broken-down furniture and th e weeds on  the porch h ad indicated  that h e had 
 178GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
fallen into a trap from which he would never es cape, exiled forever from the diam ond light and  
timeless air o f the Roman  spring. During the crushing insomnia brought on by his asthm a he would  
measure and remeasure the depth of  his misfortune as he went through the shadowy house where  
the senile fussing of Úrs ula had instilled a fear o f the world in him. In order to be sure that she 
would not l ose him in the shadows,  she had assi gned him a corner of th e bedroom, the only on e 
where he wo uld be safe from the dea d people who wandered through the house after sundown. “If 
you do anything bad,” Úrsula would tell him, “th e saints will let me know.” The terror-filled nights 
of his childhood were reduced to tha t corner where he would remain moti onless until it was time to  
go to bed, perspiring with fear on a stool under the watchful and glacial eyes of the ta ttletale sain ts. 
It was useless torture because even at that time he already had a terror of everything around him and 
he was prepared to be frightened at a nything he  met in life: women on the street, wh o would ruin 
his blood; the women in the house, who bore children with th e tail of a pig; fighting cocks, who 
brought on t he death of men and remorse for the rest  of one ’s life; firearms , which with the mere 
touch would bring down twenty years of war; uncer tain ventu res, which led only to disillusionment 
and madness —everything, in short, everything th at God h ad created in H is infinite goodness an d 
that the devi l had perverted. When he awakened, pre ssed in the vise of his nightmares, the light in 
the window and the caresses of Amaranta in the bath and  the pleasure of being powdered between  
the legs with a silk puff would release him from the terror. Even Úrsula was different under the 
radiant light in the garden because th ere she did not talk about fearful things but would brush his 
teeth with charcoal powder so that he would ha ve the radia nt smile of a  Pope, and she would cu t 
and polish his nails so that the pilgrims who ca me to Rom e from all over the world would be 
startled at the beauty of the Pope’s hands as he blessed them, a nd she woul d comb his hair like that 
of a Pope, a nd she would sprinkle his body and his clothing with toilet water so that his body and 
his clothes would have the fragrance of a Pope. In the courtyard of Castel Gandolfo he had seen  the 
Pope on a b alcony maki ng the same speech in seve n languages for a crowd of pilgrims and the onl y 
thing, indeed, that had drawn his attention was the whitenes s of his hands, which seemed to have 
been soaked in lye, the da zzling shine of his su mmer clothing, and the hidden breath of cologne. 
Almost a year after his  return home, having sold the silver candlesticks and the heraldic 
chamberpot—which at the moment of truth turned  out to have only a little gold plating on the 
crest—in order to eat, the only distr action of Jos é Arcadio  was to pick u p children in  town so  that 
they could play in the house. He would appear with th em at siesta time and have them s kip rope in 
the garden, sing on the porch, and do acrobatics o n the furniture in the living room while he would 
go among the groups giving lessons in good manner s. At that time he h ad finished with the tight 
pants and th e silk shirts and was weari ng an ordinary  suit of clothing that he had bought in the Arab 
stores, but he still maintained his languid dignity a nd his papal air. The children took over the house 
just as Meme’s schoolmates had done in the past. Until well into the ni ght they cou ld be hear d 
chattering an d singing and tap-dancing, so that the house resembled a boarding school where there  
was no discipline. Aureliano did not worry about th e invasion as long as they did not bother him in 
Melquíades’ room. One morning two children pushed open the door and were startled at the sight 
of a filthy and hairy man who was still deciphering  the parchments on the worktable. They did not 
dare go in, but they kept on watching the room. T hey would p eep in throu gh the cracks , whispering, 
they threw live animals in through the transom, an d on one occasion they nailed up the door and the 
window and it took Aureliano half a day to force them open. Amused at their unpunishe d mischief, 
four of the children went into the room one morning while Aureliano was in the kitchen, preparing 
to destroy th e parchmen ts. But as so on as they laid hands on the yellowed  sheets an a ngelic force 
lifted them off the ground and held them suspended in the ai r until Aureliano returned and took  the 
parchments away from them. From  then on they did not bother him. 
 179GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
The four oldest children, who wore short pants in spite of the fact that they were on the 
threshold of adolescen ce, busied themselves with  José Arcadi o’s personal appearance. They woul d 
arrive earlier than the o thers and spend the mor ning shaving him, giving him massages with hot 
towels, cutti ng and polishing the nails on his hand s and feet, and perfuming him with toilet water. 
On several occasions they would get into the pool to soap him from head to toe as  he floated on hi s 
back thinking about Amaranta. Then they would dr y him, pow der his body, and dress him. One of 
the children, who had curly blond hair and eyes  of pink glass like a rabbit, was accustomed to  
sleeping in the house. The bonds that linked him to José Arcadio were so strong that he would 
accompany him in his asthmatic in somnia, without speaking, strolling throu gh the house with him in 
the darkness.  One night i n the room  where Úrsula had slep t they sa w a yellow glow co ming through 
the crumbling cement as if an underground sun had changed the floor of the room into a pane of 
glass. They did not have to turn on th e light. It was sufficient to lift the broken slabs in the corner  
where Úrsula’s bed had  always stood  and wh ere the glow was  most intens e to find th e secret crypt 
that Aureliano Segundo had worn himself out sear ching for during the delirium of his excavations.  
There were the three canvas sacks closed with copper wire, and inside of them the seven thousand  
two hundred  fourteen pieces of eight, which contin ued glowing like embers in the darkness. 
The discovery of the treasure was like a deflagra tion. Instea d of returning to Rome with the 
sudden fortune, which had been his dream maturing in misery, José Arcadio converted the house 
into a decadent paradise. He replaced the curtains and the cano py of the b ed with new velvet, and he  
had the bathroom floor covered wi th paving stones and the walls with tiles. The cupboard in the 
dining room  was filled w ith fruit pres erves, ha ms, and pickles, and the unused pantry was opened 
again for the storage of wines and liqueurs which José Arcadio himself brought from the railroad 
station in crates marked with his name. One night he and th e four oldest children had a party tha t 
lasted until d awn. At six i n the morni ng they came out naked from the bedroom, drained the pool , 
and filled it  with champagne. They ju mped in en  masse, swimming like  birds flying through a sky 
gilded with fragrant bubbles, while José Arcadio, floated on hi s back on th e edge of the festivities, 
rememberin g Amaranta  with his eyes  open. He remain ed tha t way, wrapp ed up in hims elf, thinking 
about the bitterness of his equivocal pleasures until after the chi ldren had become tired a nd gone in  
a troop to the bedroom. where they tore down the cu rtains to dry themselves, and in the disorder  
they broke the rock crystal mirror into four pieces and destroyed the canop y of the bed in the tumult  
of lying down. When José Arcadio came back fr om the bathroom, he found them sleeping in a 
naked heap  in the ship wrecked bedro om. Inflamed, not so much because o f the dam age as becaus e 
of the disgust and pity th at he felt for himself in  the emptines s of the saturnalia, he armed himself 
with an eccl esiastical cat- o-nine-tails that he kept  in the botto m of his trunk along with a hair-shirt 
and other i nstruments of mortification and penance, and d rove the chi ldren out of the house,  
howling like a madm an and whipping them  witho ut mercy as a  person woul d not ev en have done to  
a pack of coyotes. He was done in, with an atta ck of asthma that lasted  for several days and tha t 
gave him t he look of a man on his deathbed. On  the third night of to rture, overcome by 
asphyxiation, he went to Aureliano’s room to ask him the favor of buying some powder s to inhale at 
a nearby dru gstore. So it was that Aureliano, wen t out for a second time.  He had to go only two 
blocks to reach th e smal l pharmacy with dusty wi ndows an d ceramic b ottles with  labels in Lati n 
where a girl with the stea lthy beauty of a serpen t of the Nile gave him the medicine the name of  
which José Arcadio had  written down on a piece of  paper. The second vi ew of the d eserted town,  
barely illuminated by the yellowish bulbs of the st reet lights, did not awaken in Aureliano any more 
curiosity than the first. José Arcadio, had come to  think that he had run a way, when he reappeared , 
panting a littl e becaus e of his haste, dra gging legs  that enclosure and lack of mobility had  made weak  
and heavy. His indifference toward the world was so certain  that a few days later José Arcadio 
violated the promise he had made to h is mother an d left him free to go out whenever he wanted to. 
 180GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
“I have nothing to do outside,” Aureliano answered him. 
He remained shut up, ab sorbed in th e parchm ents, which he was slow ly unraveling an d whose 
meaning, nevertheless, he was unable to interpret. José Arcadio would bring slices of ham to him in 
his room, sugared flowers which le ft a spring-like aftertaste in hi s mouth, and on two occasions a 
glass of fine wine. He wa s not interested in the par chments, wh ich he thought of more as an esoteri c 
pastime, but his attentio n was attra cted by the ra re wisdom a nd the inexplicable knowledge of th e 
world that h is desolate kinsman had. He discovered  then th at he could un derstand written English  
and that b etween parch ments he h ad gone from the first page to th e last of the six volumes of the 
encyclopedia  as if it were a novel. At  first he attributed to tha t the fact th at Aureliano  could speak 
about Rome as if he had lived there many years, bu t he soon became aware that he knew things that 
were not in the encyclopedia, such as the price of items. “Everything is known,” was the only reply 
he received from Aureliano when he asked him wher e he had got that information from. Aureliano,  
for his part, was surprised that José Arcadio wh en seen from close by was so different from the 
image that h e had formed of him wh en he sa w him wandering through the house. He was capable of  
laughing, of allowing himself from time to time a feeling of nostalgia for the past of th e house, and 
of showing concern for the sta te of misery present in Melquíades’ room. That dra wing closer 
together of two solitary people of the same blood was far from friendship, but it did allow them  
both to bear  up better u nder the unfathomable s olitude that separated an d united them at the sa me 
time. José Arcadio cou ld then turn to Aurelia no to  unta ngle certain  domestic p roblems tha t 
exasperated him. Aureliano, in turn, could sit an d read on th e porch, wai ting for the letters fro m 
Amaranta Úrsula, which still arrived with the usual punctuality, and could use the bathroom, from 
which José Arcadio had banished him when he arrived. 
One hot da wn they both woke up in a larm at an ur gent knocking on the street door. It was a dark 
old man with large green eyes th at gave his face a ghostly phosphorescence and with a cross of ashes  
on his forehead. His clothing in tatter s, his shoes cracked, the o ld knapsack on his shoulder his only 
luggage, he looked like a beggar, but his bearing ha d a dignity that was  in frank contradi ction to his  
appearance. It was only neces sary to look at him on ce, even i n the shado ws of the pa rlor, to realize 
that th e secr et strength that allowed him to live was not the instinct of self-preservation but th e 
habit of fear. It was Aureliano Amado r, the only survivor of Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s seventeen  
sons, searching for a respite in his lon g and hazard ous existence as a  fugitive. He identif ied himself, 
begged them to give  him refuge  in that house which during his nights as a pariah he had 
remembered  as the las t redoubt of safety left for hi m in life. But José Arcadi o and Aureli ano did not 
remember hi m. Thinking that h e was a  tramp, th ey pushed him i nto the street. They both  saw fro m 
the doorway the end of a  drama that had began b efore José Arcadio had reached the age of reason.  
Two policemen who had been chasing Aureliano Amador for years, who had tracked him like 
bloodhounds across hal f the world, came out from among the almond trees on the opposite 
sidewalk and took two sh ots with thei r Mausers which neatly p enetrated the cross of ashes. 
Ever since he had expelled the children from the house, José Arcadio was really waiting for news 
of an ocean l iner that would leave for Naples be fore Christmas. He had told Aureliano and had even 
made plans to set him up in a business that woul d bring him a living, because the bask ets of food  
had stopped coming since Fernanda’s burial. But th at last dream would not be fulfilled either. One 
September morning, after having coffee in the k itchen with Aureliano, José Arcadio was finishing 
his daily bath when thro ugh the openings in the tiles the fo ur children he had expel led from the 
house burst in. Without giving him time to defend himself, they jumped into the pool fully clothed, 
grabbed him by the hair, and held hi s head under the water until the bu bbling of his death throes 
ceased on the surface and his silent and pale dolphin body dipped down to the b ottom of the 
fragrant water. Then they took out the three sack s of gold from the hiding place which was know n 
only to  them and their victim. It wa s such a  rapid, methodica l, and brutal  action  that it was  like a  
 181GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
military operation. Aureliano, shut up  in his  room, was not aware of anythin g. That afternoon, hav-
ing missed him in the kitchen, he look ed for José Arcadio all over the hous e and found him floating  
on the perfumed mirror of the pool, enormous and bl oated and still thinking about Amaranta. Only 
then did he understand how much he had began to love him.

Chapter 19 
AMARANTA  ÚRSULA returned with th e angels of Decemb er, driven on a sailor’s breeze, leading her  
husband by a silk rope t ied around his neck. She appeared without war ning, wearin g an ivory -
colored dress, a string o f pearls that reached almo st to her knees, emerald and topaz rings, and with  
her straight hair in a smooth bun held  behind he r ears by swall ow-tail brooches. The man whom she 
had married six months before was a thin, older Fl eming with the look of a sailor about him. She 
had only to push open the door to t he parlor to re alize th at her absence h ad been  longer and m ore 
destructive than she had i magined. 
“Good Lord,” she shouted, more gay than alarmed, “it’s obvious that th ere’s no woma n in this  
house!” 
The baggage would not f it on the por ch. Besides Fe rnanda’s old trunk, which they had sent her 
off to school with, she had two upright trunks, four  large suitcases, a bag for her parasols, eight 
hatboxes, a gigantic cage with half a hundred ca naries, and her husband’s velocipede, broken down 
in a special case which allowed him to  carry it like a cello. She did not even take a day o f rest after 
the long trip. She put on some worn denim overalls  that her husband had brought along with other 
automotive i tems and set about on a new restorati on of the ho use. She scattered the red  ants, who  
had already taken possess ion of the po rch, brought th e rose bus hes back to l ife, uprooted the weeds , 
and planted ferns, orega no, and begonias again in  the pots along the railing. She took charge of a 
crew of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons, who f illed in the cracks in the floor, put doors and 
windows back on their hi nges, repaired the furnitu re, and white-washed the walls inside and out, so  
that three m onths after her arrival one breathed once more the atmosph ere of youth and festivity 
that had existed during the days of the pianola. No  one in the house had ever been in a better mood 
at all hours and under any circumstances, nor ha d anyone ever been readier to sing and dance and 
toss all item s and custo ms from the past into th e trash. With a sweep o f her broom she did awa y 
with the funeral mementos and piles of useless tra sh and articles of superst ition that had been piling 
up in the corners, and the only thing she spared, ou t of gratitude to Úrsula, was the daguerreotype of  
Remedios in the parlor. “My, such luxury,” she wo uld shout, dying with laughter. “A fourteen-year-
old grandmother!” When one of the masons told her that th e house was full of apparitions and that 
the only way to drive them out was to look for th e treasures they had l eft buried, she replied amid 
loud laughter that she did not think it was right fo r men to be s uperstitious. She was so s pontaneous, 
so emancip ated, with su ch a free and modern spirit, that Aureli ano did not know  what to do with his 
body when  he saw her a rrive. “My, my!” she sh outed happil y with open arms. “Look at how my 
darling cannibal has grown!” Before he had a chan ce to react s he had alrea dy put a  record on th e 
portable pho nograph she had brought with her a nd was tryin g to teach hi m the latest dance steps. 
She made hi m change th e dirty pan ts that h e had inherited from Colonel Aureliano B uendía and  
gave him some youthful shirts and two-toned shoe s, and she would push him into the street when  
he was spen ding too much time in Melquíades’ room. 
Active, small , and indomitable like Úrsula, and al most as pretty and provocative as Remedios the 
Beauty, she was endowed with a rare instinct for an ticipating fashion. When she received pictures of 
the most recent fashions in the mail, they only proved that she had not been wrong about the 
models that she designed herself and sewed on Am aranta’s primitive pedal machine. She subscribed  
to every fashion magazine, art publication. and popular music review published in Europe, and she 
had only to glance at them to realize that things in the world were going just as she imagined they 
were. It was  incomprehensible why a  woman with th at spirit would have returned to a dead town  
burdened by dust and hea t, and much l ess with a  husband who h ad more tha n enough m oney to liv e 
 183GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
anywhere in the world and who loved her so much that he let h imself be led around by her on a silk 
leash. As tim e passed, ho wever, her intention to  stay was mor e obvious, because sh e did not make 
any plans th at were no t a long way off, nor did she do anything that did not have as an aim the  
search for a comfortable life and a peaceful old age in Macond o. The canar y cage showed that th ose 
aims were m ade up on the spur of the mom ent. Rememb ering that h er mother had  told her in a  
letter about the extermina tion of the birds, she had delayed her trip several months until she found a  
ship that sto pped at the Fortunate Isles and th ere she chose th e finest twen ty-five pairs of canaries 
so that she could repopulate the skies of Macondo. That was the most lamentable of her numerous  
frustrated undertakings. As the birds reproduced Am aranta  Úrsula would release th em in pairs, and  
no sooner di d they feel themselves free than they fled the town. She tried i n vain to awaken love in 
them b y means of the bi rd cage th at Úrsula had bu ilt during the first reco nstruction of the house.  
Also in vain  were the ar tificial nests built of es parto grass in the almond  trees and th e birdseed 
strewn about the roofs, and arousing the captives so that their songs would dissuade the deserters,  
because they would take flights on their first attemp ts and  make a turn in the sky, just the time  
needed to fi nd the direction to the Fortunate Isles. 
A year after  her return, although she had not su cceeded  in making any friends or giving any 
parties, Amaranta Úrsula still belie ved that it was possible to resc ue the community which had been 
singled out by misfortune. Gaston, her  husband, took care not to antagonize her, although since th at 
fatal noon when he got o ff the train he realized th at his wife’s determinatio n had been provoked by  
a nostalgic mirage. Certain that she would be defea ted by the realities, he did not even take the  
trouble to p ut his velocipede togeth er, but he s et about hu nting for the largest eggs among the 
spider webs that th e mas ons had knocked down, and he woul d open them  with his fingernails and 
spend hours looking through a magnifying glass at  the tiny spi ders that em erged. Later on, thinking 
that Am aranta Úrsula was continuing with her re pairs so that her hand s would not be idle, he 
decided to assemble the handsome bicycle, on which the front wheel was much larger than the rear  
one, and he dedicated hi mself to the capture and curi ng of every native insect he coul d find in the 
region, which he sent in j am jars to hi s former pr ofessor of natural history a t the University of Liège 
where he h ad done adva nced work in entomology, although his main vocation was th at of aviator.  
When he rode the bicycl e he would wear acrobat’s tights, gaudy socks, and a Sherlock Holmes cap , 
but when he was on foot he would dr ess in a spotless natural linen suit,  white shoes, a sil k bow tie, a  
straw boater, and he would carry a willow stick in his hand. His pale eyes accentua ted h is look of a 
sailor and hi s small mustache looked  like the fur o f a squirrel. Although he wa s at least fifteen years  
older than h is wife, his alert determi nation to m ake her hap py and his qualities as a good lover 
compensated  for the difference. Actua lly, those who saw that man in his forties with careful habits, 
with the leas h around his neck and his circus bicy cle, would n ot have thou ght that h e had made a  
pact of unbr idled love with his wife a nd that they both gave i n to the reci procal drive in the least 
adequate of places and wherever the spirit moved them, as th ey had don e since they h ad began to 
keep compa ny, and with a passion that the pa ssage of time and the more and more unusual  
circumstances deepened a nd enriched. Gaston was  not only a fierce lover, with endless wisdom and  
imagination, but he was also, perhaps, the first ma n in the history of the species who had made an  
emergency landing and had come close to killing hims elf and hi s sweetheart simply to make love in a 
field of violets. 
They had m et two years  before they were married , when th e sports biplane in which he wa s 
making rolls over the school where Amaranta Ú rsula was studying made an intrepid  maneuver to 
avoid the flagpole and the primitive framework of canvas and aluminum foil was caught by the tail 
on some electric wires. From then on, paying no atten tion to his leg in splints, on week ends he 
would pick up Amaranta Úrsula at the nun’s boa rdinghouse where she lived, where the rules wer e 
not as severe as Fernanda had wanted, and he would take her to his country club. They began to  
 184GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
love each other at an alti tude of fifteen hundred f eet in the Sunday air of the moors, and they felt all 
the closer together as the beings o n earth gr ew more and  more minu te. She spok e to him of 
Macondo as the brightest and most peaceful to wn on earth, and of an enormous house, scented  
with oregan o, where she wanted  to live until old age with a  loyal husband and two s trong sons who  
would be named Rodrigo and Gonzalo, never Aureliano and José Arcadio, and a daughter who 
would be named Virginia and never R emedios. She ha d evoked the to wn idealized by nos talgia with  
such strong tenacity that Gaston und erstood that she would n ot get married unless he took her to 
live in Macondo. He agreed to  it, as he agreed later on to the leash, beca use he th ought it was a 
passing fancy that could be overcome in time . But when two years in Macondo had passed an d 
Amaranta Ú rsula was as happy as on the first day, he began to show signs of al arm. By that time he 
had dissected every dissectible insect in the region, he  spoke Spanish like a native, and he had solved 
all of the crossword puzzles in the magazines that  he received in the mail. He did not have the 
pretext of climate to hasten their retur n because n ature had end owed him wi th a colonial liver which 
resisted the drowsiness of siesta time and wa ter that had vin egar worms in it. He liked the na tive 
cooking so much that o nce he a te eighty-two igua na eggs at one sitting. Amaranta Ú rsula, on the  
other hand, had brought in by train fish and she llfish in boxes  of ice, canned meats an d preserved 
fruits, which  were the only things she  could eat, an d she still dressed in European style and received  
designs by mail in spite of the fact that she had no place to go and no one to visit an d by that tim e 
her husband was not in a mood to appreciate her s hort skirts, her tilted felt ha t, and her seven-strand  
necklaces. H er secret seemed to  lie in  the fa ct tha t she always  found a wa y to keep bus y, resolving 
domestic pr oblems tha t she herself h ad created, and doing a poor job on a thousand things which 
she would fix on the following day with a pernicious diligence  that made one think of Fernanda and  
the hereditar y vice of making something just to un make it. Her festive genius was still so alive then 
that when sh e received n ew records she would invite Gaston to stay in th e parlor until very late to  
practice th e dance steps that her scho olmates desc ribed to her in sketches a nd they wou ld generally 
end up making love on the Viennes e rocking chairs or on the bare floor. The only thi ng that she 
needed to be completely happy was the birth of her children, but she respected the p act she had  
made with h er husband not to have an y until they h ad been marr ied for five years. 
Looking for something to fill his idle  hours wi th, Gaston became accustomed to spending the 
morning in Melquíades’ room with the shy Aureliano. He took pleasure in recalling with him th e 
most hidden  corners of his country, which Aureli ano knew as  if he had s pent much time there.  
When Gasto n asked him what he ha d done to obtain knowledge that was  not in the encyclopedia, 
he received the same ans wer as José Arcadio: “Eve rything Is known.” In addition to S anskrit he ha d 
learned English and French and a littl e Latin and  Greek. Since he went ou t every afternoon at that 
time and Amaranta Úrsula had set a side a weekl y sum for him for his personal expenses, his room 
looked like a branch of the wise Catalonian’s bookstor e. He read avidly until late at ni ght, although 
from the manner in which he referred  to his read ing, Gaston thought that he did not buy the books  
in order to learn but to  verify the truth of hi s knowledge, a nd that non e of them in terested him  
more than  the parchmen ts, to which h e dedica ted mo st of his time in the morning. Both Gaston and 
his wife wou ld have liked  to incorpor ate him  into the family lif e, but Aureliano was  a hermetic man  
with a cloud of mystery that time  was making denser. It was such an unfathomable condition that 
Gaston failed in his efforts to becom e intimate with  him and  had to s eek other pastimes  for his idle 
hours. It was around that time that he conceive d the idea of esta blishing an airmail service. 
It was not a new project. Actually, he had it fair ly well advanced when he met Amaran ta Úrsula, 
except that it was not for Macondo, but for the Be lgian Congo, where his family had investments i n 
palm oil. The marriage a nd the decision to spend a few months in Macond o to please his wife had  
obliged him to postpon e it. But wh en he sa w that Amaran ta Úrsula was deter mined to organize a  
commission for public improvement and even laughed at him when  he hinted a t the possibility o f 
 185GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
returning, he understood that things were going to  take a long time and he reestablished contact 
with his forgotten partn ers in Brussels, thinking that it was  just as well to be a pioneer in the 
Caribbean as in Africa. While his steps were pr ogressing he prepared a landing field in the o ld 
enchanted region which at th at time looked like a plain of cr ushed  flintstone, and he studied the 
wind directio n, the geogra phy of the coastal region, and the bes t routes for a erial navigation, with out 
knowing that his diligence, so similar to that of Mr. Herbert, was filling the town with th e dangerous 
suspicion that his plan wa s not to set up routes bu t to plant banana trees. Enthusiastic over the idea 
that, after all, might justify his permanent establis hment in Macondo, he took several trips to the  
capital of the province, met with authorities, obtained licenses, an d drew up contracts  for exclusive 
rights. In the meantime he maintai ned a corre spondence with his par tners in Br ussels which 
resembled that of Fernanda with the invisible doctors, and he finally convinced them  to ship the 
first airplane under the care of an ex pert mech anic, who woul d assemble i t in the near est port and  
fly it to Macondo. One year after his first meditati ons and meteorological calculations, trusting in the 
repeated promises of his correspondents, he had acquired the habit of strolling through  the streets,  
looking at the sky, hanging onto the so und of the breeze in hop es that th e airplane would appear. 
Although she had not no ticed it, th e return of Amaranta Úrsula had brought on a radical chang e 
in Aureliano’s life. After the death of José Arcadi o he had become a regular customer at the wise 
Catalonian’s bookstore. Also, the freed om that he en joyed then and the time at  his dispos al awoke in 
him a certai n curiosity about the to wn, which he came to k now without any surprise. He went 
through the dusty and so litary streets,  examining with scientifi c interest the inside of houses in ruin,  
the metal screens on the windows broken by rust and the d ying birds, and the inhabitants bowed  
down by memories. He tried to reconstruct in hi s imagination the annihilated splendor of the old 
banana-company town, whose dry swimming pool wa s filled to the brim with rotting men’s and 
women’s shoes, and in the houses of which, destroyed by r ye gras s, he found the s keleton of a  
German shepherd dog st ill tied to a  ring by a steel  chain and a  telephone that was ringing, ringin g, 
ringin g until he picked it up and an anguished an d distant woman spoke in English, and he said yes,  
that the stri ke was over, that three thousand dea d people had been thrown into the sea, that the 
banana company had left, and that Macondo finally  had peace after many years. Those wanderings  
led him to the prostrate red-light district, wher e in other ti mes bundles  of banknotes had been 
burned to li ven up th e revels, and which at tha t time was  a maze of str eets more af flicted and 
miserable than the other s, with a few red lights st ill burnin g and with deserted dance halls adorned 
with the rem nants of wreaths, where the pale, fa t widows of no one, the French great-grandmothers  
and the Babylonian matriarchs, were still waiting be side their photographs. Aureliano could not fin d 
anyone who remembered  his family, not even Co lonel Aureliano Buendía, except for the oldest of  
the West Indian Negroes, an old man whose cottony  hair gave him the look of a photographic nega-
tive and who was still sin ging the mo urnful s unset psalms in th e door of h is house. Aureliano would 
talk to him i n the tortured Papiamento that h e had learned in a few weeks and sometim es he would  
share his chicken-head soup, prepared by the grea t-granddaughter, with him. She was a large black 
woman with  solid bones, the hips of a mare, tea ts like live me lons, and a round and perfect head 
armored with a hard surface of wiry hair which lo oked like a medieval warrior’s mail headdress. Her 
name was N igromanta. In those days  Aureliano lived  off the sale of silverware, candlesticks, and 
other bric-a-brac from t he house. When he was pe nniless, which was most of the time, he got 
people in th e back of th e market to give him the chicken hea ds that they were going to throw awa y 
and he would take them  to Nigromanta to make her soups, fortified wit h purslane and seasoned  
with mint. When the great-grandfather died Aure liano stopped going by the house, but he would run 
into Nigrom anta under the dark alm ond trees on th e square, using her wild-animal whistles to lure 
the few night owls. Many times he stayed with her,  speaking in Papiamento about chicken-head soup 
and other dainties of misery, and he would have ke pt right on if she had not let him know that his  
 186GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
presence frightened off customers.  Although he  sometim es felt the tempta tion and although  
Nigromanta herself might have seem ed to him as the natural culmination of a shared nostalgia, he 
did not go t o bed with her. So Aureliano was still a virgin when Amar anta Úrsula returned to 
Macondo an d gave him a  sisterly emb race tha t left him breathless. Every tim e he sa w her,  and worse 
yet when sh e showed him the latest dances, he felt  the same spongy rele ase in his bones that had 
disturbed his great-great-grandfather when Pilar Ternera mad e her pretexts about th e cards in th e 
granary. Trying to squelch the torment, he sank d eeper into the parchments and eluded the innocent 
flattery of that aunt wh o was poisoning his nights  with a flow of tribulation, but the more h e 
avoided her the more th e anxiety with  which he wai ted for her stony laughter, her howls of a happ y 
cat, and her songs of gratitude, agonizing in love at all hours and in the mo st unlikely parts of th e 
house. One night thirty feet from his bed, on the s ilver workbench, the cou ple with unhinged bellies 
broke the bo ttles and  ended up makin g love in a p ool of muriatic acid. Aureliano not only could not 
sleep for a single second, but he spent the next day with a fever, sobbing w ith rage. The first night 
that he waited for Nigromanta to come to the shadows of the almond trees it seemed like a n 
eternity, pricked as he wa s by th e needles of uncertainty and  clutching in his fist the peso and fifty 
cents that he had asked  Amaranta  Úrsula for, not so mu ch because h e needed it as to  involve her, 
debase her, prostitute her in his adve nture in so me way. Nigromanta took him to her room, which 
was lighted with false candlesticks, to her folding cot with  the bedding stained from bad loves, a nd 
to her bod y of a wild do g, hardened and withou t soul , which prepared itself to  dismiss him as if he 
were a frightened child, and suddenly it foun d a man  whose tremend ous power demanded a  
movement of seismic readjustment from her insides. 
They became lovers. Aureliano would spend his mornings deciphering parchments and at siesta 
time he would go to the bedroom where Nigromanta was waitin g for him, to teach him first how to  
do it like earthworms, then like snails, and finally lik e crabs, until she had to  leave him an d lie in wait 
for vagabond loves. Several weeks passed before Au reliano discovered that around her waist sh e 
wore a small belt that seemed to be made out of a cello string, but which was hard as steel and had  
no end, as  if it had  been born and  grown with he r. Almost al ways, between loves, th ey would eat 
naked in the bed, in the hallucinating heat and un der the dayti me stars that the rust had caused to  
shine on the zinc ceiling. It was the first time that  Nigromanta had had a stea dy man, a bone crusher  
from head to toe, as she herself said, dying with laughter, and she had even begun to get romantic 
illusions when Aureliano confided in her about his repressed passion for A maranta Úrsula, which he 
had not been able to cure with the substitution but which was twisting him inside all the more as 
experience b roadened th e horizons o f love. After th at Nigromanta con tinued to receive him with 
the same wa rmth as ever but she ma de him pay fo r her services so strictly that when Aureliano had  
no money she would make an addition to his bill, which was not figured in numbers but by marks 
that she mad e with her th umbnail behind the door. At sundown , while she was drifting through the 
shadows in the square, Aureliano, was going a long the porch like a st ranger, scarc ely greeting 
Amaranta Ú rsula and Ga ston, who u sually dined at that time,  and sh utting herself up in his room 
again, unable to read or write or even think b ecause of the a nxiety brought on by the laughter, th e 
whispering, the preliminary frolics, and then the explosions of agonizing happiness that capped the 
nights in the house. That was his life two years befo re Gaston began to wait for the airplane, and it 
went on the same way on the after noon that he went to the bookstor e of the wise Catalonian and  
found four ranting boys in a heated argument a bout the methods used to kill cockroaches in the 
Middle Ages. The old bookseller, knowing about Au reliano’s love for books that had been read only 
by the Venerable Bede, urged him with a certain fatherly malice to get into the discussion, and 
without even  taking a breath, he expla ined that the cockroach, the oldest wi nged insect on the face 
of the earth, had already been the victim of slippe rs in the Old Testa ment, but that since the speci es 
was definitely resistant to any and all methods of extermination, from tomato dices with borax to 
 187GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
flour and sugar, and with its one thou sand six hundred three v arieties had r esisted the most ancien t, 
tenacious, a nd pitiless persecution that mankind  had unleas hed against any living thing since the 
beginnings, including man himself, to such an extent that just a s an instinct for reproduction was a t-
tributed to  humankind, so there must have b een another one more definite and  pressing, which was  
the instinct to kill cockroaches, and if  the latter had succeeded in escaping human ferocity it was  
because they had taken r efuge in the shadows, wh ere they became invul nerable becau se of man’s  
congenital fear of the dark, but on the other hand  they became susceptible to the glow of noon, so 
that b y the Middle Ages alread y, and  in present ti mes, and per omnia se cula seculorum , the o nly effective 
method for killing cockroaches was the glare of the sun. 
That encyclopedic coin cidence was  the beginning  of a gre at friendship. Aureliano continued  
getting together in the afternoon with the four  arguers, w hose names  were Álvaro, Germán , 
Alfonso, and Gabriel, the first and last friends that  he ever had i n his life. For a man like him, holed 
up in written reality, those stormy sessions that  began in the bookstore and ended at dawn in the 
brothels were a revelation. It had never occurred to him until then to think that literature was the 
best playthin g that had ever been invented to ma ke fun of pe ople, as Álvaro demonstrated during 
one night of revels. Some time woul d have to pa ss before Aureliano realized th at su ch arbitrar y 
attitudes h ad their origins in the exa mple of the wise Catalo nian, for whom wisdom  was worth  
nothing if it could not be used to invent a way of preparing chick peas. 
The afternoon on which Aureliano gave his lecture on cockroaches, the argument ended up in 
the house of the girls who went to bed because of  hunger, a brothel of lies on the outskirts of 
Macondo. The proprietress was a smiling mamasanta , tormented  by a mania for opening and closing  
doors. Her eternal smile seemed to h ave been  brought on by the credulity of her customers, who  
accepted as s omething certain an esta blishment th at did not ex ist except in the imaginati on, because 
even the tan gible things there were unreal: the furniture that fell apart when one sat on it, the 
disemboweled phonogra ph with a nesting hen i nside, the garden of paper flowers, the calend ars 
going back to the years before the arrival of the banana compa ny, the frames with prints cut out of  
magazines that had never been published. Even the timid little whores who came from the neigh-
borhood: when the proprietress informed them that  customers  had arrived they were nothing but an 
invention. They would a ppear witho ut any greeti ng in their little flowered dresses left o ver from days 
when they were five years younger, and they to ok them off with the sam e innocence with which they  
had put them on, and in the paroxysms of love they would exclaim good heavens, look how tha t 
roof is fallin g in, and as s oon as they got their peso  and fifty c ents they would spend it on a roll with 
cheese that the proprietress sold them, smiling more than ever, because only she knew that that meal 
was not true either. Aureliano, whose world at th at tim e bega n with Melq uíades’ parchments and  
ended in Nigromanta’s bed, found a stupid cure fo r timidity in the small imaginary brothel. At first 
he could get nowhere, in rooms where the proprietre ss would enter during the best mom ents of love 
and make all  sorts of comments abo ut the intim ate charms of the prota gonists. But with time h e 
began to get so familiar with t hose misfortunes of the world th at on one night that was more 
unbalanced than the others he got un dressed in th e small recep tion room an d ran through the hous e 
balancing a bottle of beer on his inconceivable ma leness. He was the one who made fashionable the 
extravagances that the p roprietress celebrated wi th her eternal smile, without protesting, without 
believing in them just as when Germá n tried to bu rn the house down to show that it did not exist, 
and as when  Alfonso wrung the n eck of the parrot and threw it into th e pot where the chicken stew 
was beginning to boil. 
Although Aureliano felt himself linked to the four friends by a common affection and a common  
solidarity, even to th e poi nt where h e thought of them as if th ey were one person, he was closer to  
Gabriel than  to th e oth ers. The link was born on  the night when he casu ally mentioned Colonel  
Aureliano Buendía and Gabriel was the only one who did not think that he was making fun of 
 188GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
somebody. Even the proprietress, who normally did not  take part in the conv ersation argued with a 
madam’s wr athful passion that Col onel Aureliano Buendía, of whom she had indeed heard speak at 
some time, was a figure invented by the government  as a pretext for killing Liberals. Gabriel, on the 
other hand, did not doubt the reality of Col onel Aureliano Buendía because he had been a 
companion in arms and inseparable friend of  his great-great-grandfather Colonel Gerineldo 
Márquez. Those fickle tricks of memory were even more critical wh en the killing of the workers was 
brought up. Every time that Aurelian o mentione d the ma tter, not only th e proprietress but some 
people older than she would repudiate the myth of  the workers hemmed  in at the s tation and th e 
train with two hundred cars loaded  with dead pe ople, and they would even insist that, after all,  
everything had been set forth in ju dicial docu ments and i n primary-sc hool textbooks: that the 
banana com pany had  never existed. So that Aureli ano and Gabriel were linked by a kind of complic-
ity based on real facts that no one believed in, and which had affected their lives to the point tha t 
both of them found themselves off course in the tide of a world that had ended and of which only 
the nostalgia remained. Gabriel would sleep wher ever time overtook him. Aureliano put him up 
several times  in the silver workshop, but he would spend his nights awake, disturbed by the noise of 
the dead people who walked through the bedrooms until dawn. Later he turned him over to  
Nigromanta, who took hi m to her wel l-used room when she wa s free and put down his a ccount with  
vertical marks behind the door in the f ew spaces lef t free by Aur eliano’s debts. 
In spite of their disordered life, the whole grou p tried to do something permanent at the urging 
of the wise Catalonian. It was he, with his experien ce as a former professor of classical literature and 
his storehouse of rare books, who got them to sp end a whole night in search of the thirty-seventh  
dramatic situation in a town where no one ha d any interest any more in going beyond primary 
school. Fascinated by the discovery of friendship, bewildered by the enchantments of a world which 
had been forbidden to him by Fernanda’s mea nness, Aureliano abandoned the s crutiny of the  
parchments precisely when they were beginning to reve al themselves as predictions in coded lines of 
poetry. But the subsequent proof th at there was time enough f or everythin g without ha ving to give 
up the brothels gave him the drive to return to Me lquíades’ room, having decided not to flag in his 
efforts until he had disco vered the las t keys. Tha t was during the time tha t Gaston bega n to wait for  
the airplane and Amaranta Úrsula was so lonely th at one morni ng she appea red in the room. 
“Hello, cannibal,” she said to him. “Back in your cave again?” 
She was irresistible, with a dress she had designed and one o f the long shad-vertebra necklaces  
that she hers elf had mad e. She had s topped using th e leash, convinced of her husband’s faithfulness, 
and for the first time since her return she seem ed to have a moment of ea se. Aureliano d id not need  
to see her to know that she had arrived. She pu t her elbows on the table, so close and so helpless 
that Aureliano heard th e deep  soun d of her bo nes, and she becam e interested in th e parchments.  
Trying to overcome his disturbance, he grasped at  the voice that he was losing, the life that was 
leaving him, the memory that was turning into a petrified polyp, and he spoke to her about the 
priestly destiny of Sanskrit, the sc ientific possibilit y of seeing the future showing through in time as  
one sees what is written on the back of a sh eet of paper through the light, the necessity o f 
deciphering the predictions so tha t they woul d not defea t thems elves, and the Centuries  of 
Nostradamu s and the destruction of Cantabria pr edicted by Saint Milanus. Suddenly, without 
interrupting the cha t, moved by an  impulse that had been  sleeping in him since his origins,  
Aureliano pu t his hand  on hers, think ing that that final decision would put a n end to his doubts. She 
grabbed his index finger with the affectionate in nocence with which she h ad done so i n childhood, 
however, an d she h eld it while he kept on answer ing questions. They remained like that, linked by 
icy index fingers that did  not transmi t anything  in any way un til she awok e from her momentar y 
dream and  slapped her f orehead with her hand.  “The ants!” she exclaimed. And th en she forgot 
about the m anuscripts, went to the door with a dance step, and from th ere she threw Aureliano  a 
 189GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
kiss with the tips of her fingers as she had said  good-bye to her father on the afternoon when they 
sent her to Brussels. 
“You can tell me later,” she said. “I fo rgot that  today’s the day to put quicklime on the anthills.” 
She continued going to the room occasionally when she had something to do in that part of the 
house and sh e would stay there for a few minutes wh ile her husband continued to scrutinize the sky.  
Encouraged by that chan ge, Aureliano stayed to eat with the family at that time as he had not don e 
since the first months  of Amaranta  Úrsula’s retu rn. Gaston wa s pleased. D uring the co nversations 
after meals, which usuall y went on for more than an hour, he complained that his partners wer e 
deceiving him. They had  informed him of the loadin g of the airplane on board a ship that did not 
arrive, and although his shipping agents insisted, th at it would never arrive because it was  not on the 
list of Caribbean ships, his partners insisted that  the shipment was correct and they even insinuated  
that Gaston was lying to them in his letters. Th e correspondence reached s uch a degree of mutual 
suspicion that Gaston decided not to  write again and he began to suggest the possibility of a quick  
trip to Brussels to clear things up and return with the airplane. The plan evaporated, however, a s 
soon as Amaranta Úrsula reiterated her decision not  to mov e from Macondo even if she lost a 
husband. During the first days Aureliano shared  the general opinion that Gaston was  a fool on a  
velocipede, and that brought on a vag ue feeling of pity. Later, when he obtained deep er information 
on the natur e of men in the brothels, he thought that Gaston’s  meekness had its origins in unbridled 
passion. But when he came to know him better an d realized h is true character was th e opposite of 
his submissive conduct, he conceived the malicious suspicion that even the wait for the airplane was 
an act. Then he thought that Gaston was not as f oolish as he appeared, but, quite the co ntrary, was a 
man of infinite steadiness, ability, and patience who had s et about to conquer his wife with th e 
weariness of eternal agreement, of never saying no, of simulating a limitless conformity, letting her  
become enm eshed in her own web un til the day sh e could no lo nger bear th e tedium of the illusions 
close at hand and would pack the bags herself to go back to Europe. Aureliano’s former pity turned  
into a violen t dislike. Gaston’s system seemed so p erverse to hi m, but at the same tim e so effective, 
that he ventured to warn Amaranta Úrsula. She made fun of his suspicio ns, however, without even 
noticing the heavy weight of love, uncertainty, and jeal ousy that he had inside. It had not occurred to 
her that she was arousing something more than fra ternal affection in Aureliano until she pricked her 
finger trying to open a can of pe aches  and he dash ed over to suck the bloo d out with a n avidity and 
a devotion that sent a chi ll up her spine. 
“Aureliano!” She laughed, disturbed. “Y ou’re too suspicious to be a good bat.” 
Then Aureliano went all  out. Giving her some small, orphaned kisses in the hollow of he r 
wounded hand, he opened up the most hidden  passageways of his heart and drew out an  
interminable and lacerated intestine,  the terrible pa rasitic animal that ha d incubated  in his mar-
tyrdom. He told her how he would get up at mi dnight to weep in loneliness and rage over the 
underwear that she had left to dry in the bathroo m. He told her about the anxiety with which he had  
asked Nigromanta  to ho wl like a cat and sob gast on gaston gaston in his ea r, and with  how much  
astuteness  he had rans acked her vials of perfume so that he could smell it on the neck s of the littl e 
girls who w ent to bed because of hunger. Frigh tened by the passion of that outb urst, Amaranta  
Úrsula was closing her fingers, contracting them lik e a shellfish  until her w ounded hand, free o f all 
pain and an y vestige of pity, was co nverted into  a knot of emeralds and  topazes and stony and 
unfeeling bones. 
“Fool!” she s aid as if she were spitting. “I’m  sailin g on the first ship leaving for Belgium.” 
Álvaro had come to the wise Catalonian’s book store one of those afternoons proclaiming at the 
top of his lungs his latest discovery: a zoological brothel. It was called The Golden Child and it was 
a huge open  air salon th rough which no less th an two hundr ed bitterns who told th e time with a  
deafening cackling strolled at will. In  wire pens  that surrounded the dance floor and a mong large  
 190GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Amazonian camellias there were her ons of different colors, crocodiles as fat as pigs, s nakes with 
twelve rattl es, and a turtl e with a  gilded shell who  dove in a s mall artificial ocean. Ther e was a  big 
white dog, meek and a pederast, wh o would give stud  services nevertheles s in order to be fed. The  
atmosphere had an innocent denseness, as if it ha d just been cr eated, and the beautiful mulatto girls 
who waited hopelessly among the blood-red peta ls and the outmoded phonograph records knew 
ways of love that man h ad left behind forgotten in the earthly paradise. The first night that the 
group visite d that greenhouse of illusions the spl endid and taciturn old woman who g uarded the 
entrance in a  wicker rocking chair felt that tim e was turning back to its earliest origins when among  
the five who were arriving she saw a bony, jaundiced man with Tartar cheekbones, marked forever 
and from the beginning of the world with the pox  of solitude. 
“Lord, Lord, ” she sighed,  “Aureliano!” 
She was s eeing Colonel Aureliano B uendía once more as she had seen him in the light of a lamp 
long before the wars, lo ng before the desolatio n of glory and the exile of disillusionment, tha t 
remote dawn when he went to her bedroom to give the first command of his life: the command to  
give him love. It was Pilar Ternera. Years before, when she h ad reached on e hundred forty-five years  
of age, she had given up the perniciou s custom of  keeping track of her age and she went on living in  
the static an d marginal time of memories, in a fu ture perfectly revealed and established, beyond th e 
futures disturbed by the i nsidious snares and suppositions of her cards. 
From that ni ght on Aurel iano, took refuge in the compassionate tend erness and understa nding of 
his unknown great-great-grandmother. Sitting in he r wicker ro cking chair, she would recall the past,  
reconstruct the grandeur and misf ortunes of the family and the splendor of Macondo, which was 
now erased, while Álvaro frightened the crocodile s with his n oisy laughter and Alfons o invented  
outlandish stories about the bittern s who had  pecked ou t the eyes of four customers who  
misbehaved the week before, and Gabriel was in th e room of the pensive mulatto girl who did not 
collect in m oney but in l etters to a s muggler boyfriend who was in priso n on the oth er side of th e 
Orinoco because the bor der guards had caught hi m and had made him sit on a chamberpot that 
filled up with a mixture of shit an d diamonds. That true brothel, wi th that maternal proprietress, was  
the world of which Aureliano had dreamed during his prolonged captivity. He felt so well, so close 
to perfect co mpanionship, that he tho ught of no other refuge on the afternoon on which Amaranta 
Úrsula had made his ill usions crumble. He was  ready to u nburden himself with words so th at 
someone co uld break th e knots that  bound his chest, but he only ma naged to let out a fluid, warm, 
and restorati ve weeping in Pilar Ternera’s lap. She let him finish, scratching his head with the tips of  
her fingers, and witho ut his having revealed that he was  weeping from love, she recognized 
immediately the oldest so bs in the history of man. 
“It’s all right, child,” she consoled him. “Now tell me who it is.” 
When Aureliano told her, Pilar Ternera let out a d eep laugh, the old expansive laugh that ended 
up as a cooing of doves. There was no mystery in the heart of a Buendía that was impenetrable for  
her because a cen tury of cards and experience ha d taught her that the his tory of the family was a  
machine with unavoidable repetitions,  a turning wh eel that would have gone on spilling into eternity 
were it not f or the progressive and irremediable wearing of the axle. 
“Don’t worry,” she said, smiling. “Wherever she is right now, she’s waiting for you.” 
It was half past four in the afternoo n when Amaranta Úrsula came ou t of her bath. Aureliano 
saw her go by his room with a robe of soft folds and a towel wrapped around her head like a turban.  
He followed her almost on tiptoes, stumbling from drunke nness, and he went into the nuptial 
bedroom just as she op ened the robe a nd closed it ag ain in frigh t. He made a silent signal toward the 
next room where the doo r was half o pen and wh ere Aureliano  knew th at Gaston was beginning to 
write a letter. 
“Go away,” she said voicelessly. 
 191GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Aureliano, smiled, picked her up by the wais t with both hands like a pot of begonias, and 
dropped her on her back on the bed. With a brutal tug he pulled off her bathrobe before she had  
time to resist and he loo med over an  abyss of n ewly washed nudity whos e skin color, lines of fuzz, 
and hidden moles had all been imag ined in the shadows of the other rooms. Amaranta Úrsula 
defended herself sincerely with the as tuteness of a wise woma n, weaseling her slippery, flexible, and 
fragrant weasel’s body as she tried to knee him in  the kidneys and scorpion his face with her nails, 
but without either of them giving a gasp that mi ght not h ave been tak en for that brea thing of a 
person watching the meager April sunset through th e open window. It was a fierce fight, a battle to 
the dea th, but it seemed to be wi thout violence be cause it cons isted of disto rted attacks and ghostly 
evasions, slow, cautious, solemn, so that during it all there wa s time for the petunias to  bloom and 
for Gaston to forget abo ut his aviato r’s dream in the next roo m, as if they were two enemy lovers 
seeking reconciliation at the bottom of an aquarium . In the heat of that savage and ceremonious  
struggle,  Amaranta Úrsul a understood that her m eticulous silence was so irrational that it could  
awaken the s uspicions of her nearby husband much  more than  the sound o f warfare that they were 
trying to avoid. Then she began to lau gh with her lips tight together, without giving up the fight, but 
defending herself with false bites an d deweaselin g her body little by littl e until they both were 
conscious of being adversaries and accomplices at the same ti me and the affray degenerated into a  
conventional  gambol and the atta cks became caresse s. Suddenly, almost playfully, like one more bit 
of mischief, Amaranta Ú rsula dropped her defense, and when she tried to recover, frightened by 
what she herself had ma de possible, it was t oo late. A great commotion immobilized her in her 
center of gravity, planted her in her place, and her defensive will wa s demolished by the irresistible 
anxiety to  discover what the orange whistles and the invisible globes on th e other side of  death  were 
like. She barely had time to reach ou t her hand a nd grope for the towel to put a gag between her  
teeth so that she would not let out th e cat howls  that were alrea dy tearing at her insides.

Chapter 20 
PILAR TERNERA died in her wicker rocking chair during one  night of festivities as she watched over 
the entran ce to her para dise. In acco rdance with her last wish es she was n ot buried in a coffin but 
sitting in her rocker, which eight men lowered b y ropes into  a huge hole dug in the center of th e 
dance floor. The mulatto  girls, dressed in black, pale from weeping, invented shadowy rites as th ey 
took off their earrings, brooches, and  rings and thr ew them  into the pi t before it was closed over  
with a slab that bore neither name nor dates, an d that was covered wi th a pile of Amazoni an 
camellias. Af ter poisoning the anim als they closed up the doors an d windows with brick and mortar  
and they sca ttered out into the world with their wooden trunks that were lined with pictures of 
saints, prints from magazines, and th e portraits of sometime sweethearts,  remote and fa ntastic, wh o 
shat diamon ds, or ate ca nnibals, or were cr owned playing-card kings on the high seas. 
It was the end. In Pilar Ternera’s tomb, among the psalm and cheap whore jewelry, the ruins of 
the past wou ld rot, the little that remained after the wise Catalonian had auctioned off his bookstore 
and returned to the Mediterranean village where he  had been born, overcome by a yearning fo r a 
lasting springtime. No o ne could h ave foreseen hi s decision. He had arrived in Macondo during the 
splendor of the banana company, fleeing from on e of many wars, and nothing more practical had  
occurred to him than to set up that bookshop of incunabula and first editions in several languages, 
which casual  customers would thumb through cautiousl y, as if they were junk books, as they waited  
their turn to have their dreams interpr eted in the h ouse across the way. He s pent half his life in the 
back of the store, scribbling in his ext ra-careful ha nd in purple ink and on pages that he tore out of  
school notebooks, and no one was sure exactly what  he was writing. When Aureliano first met him 
he had two boxes of t hose motley pages that in some way made on e think of Melquíades’ 
parchments, and from that time until he left he ha d filled a third one, so it was reasonable to believe 
that he had  done nothi ng else during his st ay in Macondo. The only people with whom he 
maintained relations were the four friends, whom he had exch anged their tops and kites for books, 
and he set them to reading Seneca and  Ovid while  they were sti ll in grammar school. He treated the 
classical writers with a household familiarity, as if they had all been his roommates at some period,  
and he knew many things that should not have b een known,  such as  the fact tha t Saint Augustine 
wore a wool jacket und er his habit that he did n ot take off for fourteen years and th at Arnaldo o f 
Villanova, the necromancer, was impotent since child hood because of a scorpion bite. Hi s fervor for 
the written word was an  interweavin g of solemn respect and gossipy irreverence. Not even his own  
manuscripts were safe from that dualism. Having le arned Catala n in order to  translate them, Alfonso  
put a roll of pages in his pockets, which were always full of newspaper cli ppings and manuals for  
strange trades, and one night he lost them in the h ouse of the little girls who went to b ed because of 
hunger. When the wise old grandfather found out, in stead of r aising a row as had b een feared, he 
commented, dying with laughter, that it was the na tural destiny of literature. On the other hand,  
there was no human power capable of persuading him not to take along the three boxes when  he 
returned to his native village, and he unleashed a string of Carthaginian curses at the railroad 
inspectors who tried to ship them as freight until he finally succeeded in keeping them with him i n 
the pass enger coach. “Th e world mus t be all fucked up,” he s aid then, “when men  travel first clas s 
and literature goes as freight.” That was the last th ing he was heard to say. He had spent a dark week 
on the final preparations for the trip, because as the hour approached his humor was breaking down 
and things began to be misplaced, a nd what h e put in one p lace would a ppear in ano ther, atta cked 
by the sam e elves that ha d tormented Fernanda. 
“Collons ,” he would curse. “I shit on Canon Twenty-seven of the Synod of London.” 
 193GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
Germán and  Aureliano took care of him. They he lped him like a child, fastening his tickets an d 
immigration documents to his pockets with safety pins, making him a detailed list of what he must 
do from the time he left Macondo until he landed in Barcelona, but nonetheless he th rew away a  
pair of pants with half of his money in it withou t realizing it. The night before the trip, after nailing 
up the boxes and putting his clothing into the same  suitcase that he had brought when he first came,  
he narrowed his clam eyes, pointed with a kind of impudent benediction at the stacks of books with 
which he had endured during his exile, and said to his friends: 
“All that shit there I leave to you peop le!” 
Three months later they received in a large en velope twenty-nine letters and more than fifty 
pictures that he had accu mulated during the leisure of the high seas. Althou gh he did not date them,  
the order in which he had written the letters was obv ious. In the first ones, with his customary good 
humor, he s poke about the difficulties of the cro ssing, the urge he h ad to throw the ca rgo officer 
overboard when he woul d not let him  keep the three boxes in  his cabin, the clear imbecili ty of a  lady 
who was  terrified at the number thirteen, not out of superstition but beca use she thou ght it was  a 
number tha t had no  end, and th e bet th at he had won du ring the first dinner because he had 
recognized in the drinking water on board the taste of the nighttime beets b y the springs of Lérida. 
With the passage of the days, however, the reality of life on board mattered less and less to him and 
even the mo st recent an d trivial happenings seemed  worthy of nostalgia, because as  the ship got 
farther away, his memory began to grow sad. That  process of nostalgia was also evident in the 
pictures. In the first ones  he looked happy, with his sport shirt which look ed like a hos pital jacket 
and his snowy mane, in an October  Caribbean f illed with whitecaps. In the last ones  he could be  
seen to  be wearing a dark coat an d a milk scarf, pale in the face, taciturn  from absen ce on the deck  
of a mournful ship that h ad come to b e like a sleep walker on th e autumnal s eas. Germán  and Aureli-
ano answered his letters. He wrote so  many during th e first months that a t that time th ey felt closer 
to him th an when he had  been in  Macondo, and th ey were almo st freed from the ran cor that he ha d 
left behind. At first he told them that everything was just the same, that the pink snails  were still in 
the house where he had been born, that the dry h erring still had the same taste on a pi ece of toast,  
that the waterfalls in the  village still took on a perfumed smell at dusk. They were the notebook 
pages again, woven with the purple scribbling, in  which he dedicated a s pecial paragraph to each 
one. Nevertheless, and although he himself did not seem to  notice it,  thos e letters of r ecuperation  
and stimulation were slowly changing into pastor al letters of disenchantment. One winter night 
while the soup was boiling in the fire place, he missed  the heat of the back of his store, the buzzing  
of the sun on the dusty a lmond trees, the whistle of the train during the lethar gy of sie sta time, just 
as in Macon do he had  missed the winter soup in th e fireplace, the cries of th e coffee ven dor, and th e 
fleeting larks of springtime. Upset by two nostal gias facing each other like two mirrors, he lost his 
marvelous sense of unreality and he ended up recommen ding to all of them that they leave  
Macondo, th at they forget everything he had taugh t them a bout the world a nd the huma n heart, that 
they shit on Horace, and that wher ever they might be  they alwa ys remember  that the pas t was a lie, 
that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest 
and most ten acious love was an ephemeral truth in the end. 
Álvaro was the first to take the advice to aband on Macondo. He sold everything, even the tam e 
jaguar that teased pass ersby from the courtyard  of his house, and he boug ht an eternal  ticket o n a 
train that never stopped traveling. In the postcards that he sent from the way stations he would 
describe with shouts the instantaneou s images tha t he had seen from the window of his coach, and  it 
was as if he were tearing up and throwing into oblivion some long, evanescent poem: th e chimerica l 
Negroes in the co tton f ields of Louisiana, the winged horses in the bluegrass of Kentucky, the 
Greek lovers in the infernal sunsets of Arizona, the girl in the red sweater p ainting watercolors by a 
lake in Michi gan who wa ved at him with her brush es, not to say farewell bu t out of hope, because 
 194GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
she did not know that she was watching a trai n with no return passing by. Then Alfonso and  
Germán left one Saturday with the idea of co ming back on Monday, but nothing more was ever 
heard of them. A year after the depar ture of the wi se Catalonian the only one left in Macondo was 
Gabriel, still adrift at the mercy of Nigromanta ’s chancy ch arity and answering the questions of a  
contest in a French magazine in which the first pr ize was a trip  to Paris. Aureliano, who was the one 
who subscribed to it, helped him fill in the answer s, sometimes in his house but most of the time  
among the ceramic bottles and atmos phere of valeri an in the only pharmacy left in Macondo, where 
Mercedes, Gabriel’s stealthy girl friend, lived. It  was the l ast tha t remained of a past whos e 
annihilation had not taken place because it was still in a proc ess of annihilation, consuming itself 
from within, ending at every momen t but neve r ending its ending. The town had rea ched such  
extremes of inactivity th at when  Gab riel won th e contes t and  left for Paris with two changes of  
clothing, a pair of shoes, and th e com plete works of Rabelais, he had  to sig nal the engineer to  stop 
the train and  pick him up. The old Street of the T urks was at that time an a bandoned co rner where 
the last Arab s were lettin g themselves  be dragged o ff to death with the age-ol d custom of sitting in 
their doorways, although it had been many years si nce they ha d sold the last yard of diagonal cloth, 
and in the shadowy showcases only th e decapitated  manikins remained. The banana com pany’s city, 
which Patricia Brown may have tried to evoke for he r grandchildren during t he nights of intolerance 
and dill pick les in Prattville, Alabama,  was a plain of wild grass. The anci ent priest who had taken 
Father Angel’s place an d whos e name no one had bothered to find out awaited God’s mercy 
stretched ou t casually in a hammock, tortured by arthritis and the insomnia of doubt while the 
lizards and rats fought over the inheritance of th e nearby chur ch. In that Macondo forgotten even 
by the birds, where the dust and th e heat had b ecome so  strong that it was difficult to brea the, 
secluded by solitude and love and by the solitude of  love in a house where it was almost impossibl e 
to sleep  beca use of the n oise of the red ants, Aureliano, and Amaranta  Úrsula were th e only h appy 
beings, and the most hap py on the face of the earth. 
Gaston had returned to Brussels. Tired of w aiting for t he airplane, one day he put his 
indispensable things into a small suitcase, took his file of correspondence, and left with the idea of  
returning by air before his concession was turned  over to a group of German pilots who had  
presented th e provincial authorities with a more  ambitious project th an his.  Since th e afternoon of 
their first love, Aureliano and Amar anta Úrsula had continu ed taking advantage of her husband’ s 
rare unguarded moments , making love with gagged ardor in chance meeti ngs and almost always 
interrupted by unexpected returns. But when they saw th emselves alone in the house they  
succumbed to the delirium of lovers who were ma king up for lost time. It was a mad passion, 
unhinging, w hich made F ernanda’s bones tremble with  horror in her grave and which kept them in a 
state of perp etual excitement. Am aranta Úrsula’s shrieks, her songs of agony would break out the 
same at two i n the afternoon on the di ning-room tabl e as at two in the morning in the pan try. “What 
hurts me most,” she would say, laughing, “is all th e time that we was ted.” In the bewi lderment of  
passion she watched the ants devastating the garden, sating their prehistoric hunger with the beam  
of the house,  and she watched the torrents of living lava take ov er the porch again, but she bothered  
to fight them only when  she found them in her b edroom. Aureliano aband oned the p archments, did  
not leave the house again, and carelessly answered  the letters  from the wise Catalonia n. They lost 
their sense of reality, the notion of time, the rhythm of daily habits. They closed th e doors and  
windows again so as not to waste time getting  undressed and they wa lked about the house as  
Remedios th e Beauty ha d wanted to  do and they would roll around naked in the m ud of the 
courtyard, and one afternoon they al most drowned as th ey made love in the cistern. In a short ti me 
they did more damage than the red ants: they destroyed the furniture in the parlor, in their madness  
they tore to  shreds the hammock th at had resisted the sad bivouac loves of Colonel Aureliano  
Buendía and  they disemb oweled th e mattresses a nd emptied them on th e floor as they suffocated in 
 195GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
storms of cotton. Although Aureliano was just as ferocious a lover as his rival, it was Amaranta 
Úrsula who ruled in that paradise of disaster with  her mad ge nius and her lyrical vorac ity, as if she 
had concentrated in her love the unconquerable energy that her great-great-grandmother had given 
to the makin g of little candy animals. And yet, wh ile she was singing with pleasure and  dying with  
laughter over her own inventions, Au reliano was b ecoming more and more absorbed and silent, for 
his passion was self-centered and b urning. Neve rtheless, they both reached such extremes of  
virtuosity that when  they beca me ex hausted from excitem ent, they woul d take adva ntage of thei r 
fatigue. They would give themselves over to the worship of t heir bodies, discovering t hat the res t 
periods of lo ve had unexplored possibilities, much richer than those of desire. While h e would rub 
Amaranta  Úrsula’s erect b reasts with egg whites or  smooth her elastic thighs  and pea ch-like stomach  
with cocoa butter, she would play with Aureliano’s portentous creature as if it were a doll and would  
paint clown’ s eyes on it with her lipstick and give it a Turk’s mustache with her eyebrow pencil, a nd 
would put on organza bow ties and little tinfoil hats. One night they daub ed themselves from head  
to toe with peach jam an d licked each other like dogs and made mad love on the floor of the porch, 
and they wer e awakened by a torrent of carnivor ous ants who were ready to eat th em al ive. 
During the pauses in their delirium, Amaranta Úr sula would answer Gaston ’s letters. She felt him  
to be so far a way and  busy that his return seemed impossible to  her. In one of his first letters he told 
her that his Partners had actually sent the airplane , but that a shipping agen t in Brussels had sent it  
by mistake to Tanganyika, where i t was delivered to the sca ttered tribe of the Makondo s. That mix-
up brought on so many difficulties that just to ge t the plane b ack might tak e two years. So Amaranta 
Úrsula dismissed the pos sibility of an inopportune  return. Au reliano, for his part, had no other  
contact with  the world except for the letters from the wise Catalonian a nd the news  he had of 
Gabriel thro ugh Mercedes, the silent pharmacist. At first they were real co ntacts. G abriel had turned 
in his return ticket in or der to stay in Paris, selling the old newspapers and empty bottles that the  
chambermai ds threw out of a gloomy hotel on the Rue Dauphine. Aureliano could visualize him 
then in a turtleneck sweater which he took off only when the sidewalk Ca fés on Montpar nasse filled 
with springtime lovers, and sleeping by day and writ ing by night in order to confuse hunger in the 
room that s melled of boiled cauliflower where R ocamadour was to die. Nevertheless , news about 
him was slowly becom ing so uncertain, and th e letters from the wise man so sporadic and  
melancholy,  that Aureli ano grew to  think about them as Amaranta Ú rsula thought about her  
husband, and both of them remained floating in  an empty universe where the only everyday and 
eternal reality was love. 
Suddenly, like the stamp ede in that world of happy unawareness, came the news of Gaston’s  
return. Aureliano and Amaranta Úrs ula opened their eyes , dug deep into their souls, looked at the 
letter wi th their hands on their hearts, and understo od that they were so clos e to each  other that the y 
preferred death to s eparation. Then s he wrote her  husband a l etter of con tradictory tru ths in which 
she repeated her love and said how anxious she wa s to s ee him again, but at the sa me time sh e 
admitted as a design of fate the impossibility of living without Aure liano. Contrary to what they had 
expected, G aston sent them a calm, almost patern al reply, with two whole pages devoted to a 
warning against the fickleness of passion and a fina l paragraph with unmista kable wishes for them to 
be as happy as he had been during his brief conjug al experience. It was such an unforeseen attitude 
that Amaranta Úrsula felt humiliated by the idea that she had  given her husband the pr etext that he 
had wanted i n order to abandon her to her fate. The rancor was aggravated six months later when 
Gaston wrote again from Léopoldville,  where he had finally recovere d the airplane, simply to ask  
them to ship him the velocipede, which of all that he had left behind in Macondo was the only thing 
that had any sentimental value for him. Aureliano  bore Am aranta Úrsula’s spite patien tly and made 
an effort to show her that he could be as good a husband in a dversity as in prosperity, and the dail y 
needs that b esieged them when Gaston’s last money ran out created a bond of solidarity between  
 196GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
them tha t was not as dazzling and heady as passion, but that let them make love as much and be as  
happy as during their uproarious and salacious days. At the time Pilar Ternera died they were  
expecting a child. 
In the lethar gy of her pregnancy, Amaranta Úrsula tried to set up a business in necklaces mad e 
out of the ba ckbones of fish. But exce pt for Merced es, who bought a dozen, she could not find any 
customers. Aureliano was aware for the first time  that his  gift for languages, his encyclopedi c 
knowledge, his rare faculty for remembering the d etails of remote deeds and places without having 
been th ere, were as  useless as th e box  of genuine j ewelry th at his wife owned, which mu st have b een 
worth as much as all the money tha t the last inhabitants of Macondo could have put together. They 
survived miraculously. Al though Amaranta Úrsula did not los e her good humor or her genius for 
erotic mischief, she acquired the habit of sitting on  the porch after lunch in a kind of wakeful and 
thoughtful siesta. Aurelia no would accompany her. Sometimes they woul d remain th ere in silence 
until nightfall, opposite each other, looking into each  other’s eyes, loving each other as much as i n 
their scandal ous days. Th e uncertainty of the future made them turn their  hearts to ward the past. 
They saw th emselves in the lost paradise of the deluge, splashing in the puddles in the courtyard , 
killing lizards to hang on Úrsula, pretending that they were going to bury her alive, and thos e 
memories revealed to th em the truth  that they had been hap py together ever since they had had  
memory. Going deeper into the pas t, Amaranta Úrsula remembered the afternoon on which she had  
gone into the silver shop and her mother told he r that little Aur eliano was nobody’s child because he 
had been fo und floating in a basket.  Although the version seemed unlik ely to th em, they did no t 
have any information en abling them to replace it with  the true one. All tha t they were s ure of after  
examining an the possibilities was that Fernanda  was not Aureliano’s mother. Amaranta Úrsula was  
inclined to believe that he was the son of P etra Cotes, of whom she remembered only tales of  
infamy, and that supposition produced a twinge of horror in her heart. 
Tormented by the certai nty tha t he was his wife’s  brother, Aureliano ran out to the parish house 
to search through the moldy and moth-eaten archiv es for some clue to his parentage. The oldest 
baptismal certificate that he found wa s that of Am aranta Buen día, baptized  in adolescen ce by Father  
Nicanor Reyna during the time wh en he was trying  to prove the existence of  God by mea ns of tricks 
with chocola te. He began  to have that feeling that he was on e of the seven teen Aurelianos, whos e 
birth certificates he track ed down as he went thro ugh four volumes, but the baptism dates were too 
far back for his age. Seeing him lost  in the labyrint hs of kinship, trembling with uncertai nty, the arth-
ritic priest, who was watching him from his ha mmock, asked him compassionately what his name 
was. 
“Aureliano Buendía,” he said. 
“Then don’t wear yourself out searching,” the prie st exclaimed with final conviction. “Many years  
ago there us ed to be a  street h ere with that na me and in  those days  people had th e custom  of 
naming their children after streets.” 
Aureliano trembled with rage. 
“So!” he said. “You don’t believe it either.” 
“Believe what?” 
“That Colonel Aureliano, Buendía fought thirty-two civil wars and lost them all,” Aureliano 
answered. “That the ar my hemm ed in and machin e-gunned three thous and workers and that th eir 
bodies were carried off to be thrown i nto the sea o n a train with two hundred cars.” 
The priest m easured him with a pityin g look. 
“Oh, my son,” he signed. “It’s enough for me to  be sure that you  and I exist at this moment.” 
So Aureliano  and Amaran ta Úrsula accepted the v ersion of the basket, not  because they believed 
it, but becau se it spared them their terror. As th e pregnancy a dvanced they were beco ming a single 
being, they were becomi ng more and  more integrated  in the s olitude of a house that n eeded only 
 197GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
one last breath to b e knocked down. They rest ricted th emselves to an essential  area, from 
Fernanda’s bedroom, where the cha rms of sedentar y love were visible, to the beginning of the 
porch, where Amaran ta Úrsula would sit to s ew bootees an d bonnets f or the newb orn baby an d 
Aureliano, would answer the occasion al letters from the wise Catalonian. The rest of the house wa s 
given over t o the tenacious assault of destruction. The silver shop, Melquíades’ room, the primitive 
and silent realm of Santa Sofía de la Piedad remain ed in the depths of a domestic jungle that no one  
would have had the cou rage to pen etrate. Surro unded by th e voracity o f nature, Au reliano and  
Amaranta Ú rsula continued cultivating the oregano and the begonias and defended thei r world with 
demarcation s of quicklime, building the last tren ches in the a ge-old war between man  and ant.  Her 
long and neglected hair, the splotches that were begi nning to appear on her face, the s welling of her 
legs, the deformation of her former lovemaking weasel’s bod y had changed Amaranta Úrsula from  
the youthful creature she had been wh en she arrive d at the house with the cage of luckless canaries 
and her captive husband, but it did not change th e vivacity of her spirit. “Shit,” she would say, 
laughingly. “Who would have thought that we really would end up living like cannibals!” The last 
thread th at joined them  to the world was br oken on the sixth month of pregnancy when they 
received a letter th at obv iously was n ot from the wi se Catalonian. It had b een mailed  in Barcelona , 
but the env elope was ad dressed in co nventional blue ink by an official hand and it had the innocent 
and impersonal look of hostile messages. Aureliano snatched it out of Amaranta Úrsula’s hands as 
she was abo ut to open it.  
“Not this one,” he told her. “I d on’t want to kno w what it sa ys.” 
Just as he had sensed, the wise Catalonian did not write again. The stra nger’s letter, which no one 
read, was lef t to the mer cy of th e moths on the shelf where Fernanda ha d forgotten her wedding  
ring on occasion and there it remained, consuming it self in the inner fire of its bad news as th e 
solitary lovers sailed against the tide of those days  of the last stages, those impenitent and ill-fate d 
times which were squandered on the useless effort of  making them drift toward the desert of  
disenchantment and  oblivion. Aware of that mena ce, Aurelian o and Amara nta Úrsula s pent th e hot 
months holding hands, ending with the love of loyalty for the child who had his beginning in the  
madness of fornication. At night, holding each  other in b ed, they were not frightened by th e 
sublunary explosions of the ants or the noise of the moths or the constan t and clean whistle of the 
growth of the weeds in th e neighboring rooms. Many times they were awak ened by the traffic of the 
dead. They could hear Úrsula fighting against the la ws of creation to m aintain the li ne, and José 
Arcadio Buendía searchin g for the mythical truth o f the great in ventions, an d Fernanda praying, and 
Colonel Aureliano Buendía stupefying himself with the decep tion of war and the little gold fishes, 
and Aureliano Segundo d ying of so litude in the turmo il of his debauches, an d then they learned tha t 
dominant obsessions can prevail against death and they were h appy again with the certai nty that they 
would go on loving each other in th eir shape as  apparitions long after other species of future animal s 
would steal from the insects the parad ise of misery  that th e insects were final ly stealing from man. 
One Sunday, at six in  the afternoon, Amaranta Ú rsula felt the pangs of childbirth. The  smiling 
mistress of the little girls who went to bed beca use of hunger had her get  onto the dining-room  
table, straddl ed her stom ach, and mis treated h er with wild gallops until her cries were drowned out 
by the bellows of a formidable male child. Throug h her tears Amaranta Úrsula could see that he was 
one of those great Buendías, strong a nd willful lik e the José Arcadios, with the open and clairvoyant 
eyes of the Aurelianos, and predisposed to begin the race again  from the beginning and cleanse it of  
its pernicious vices and solitary calling, fo r he was the only one in a century who had been 
engendered with love. 
“He’s a real cannibal.” she said. “We’ll name him R odrigo.” 
“No,” her husband coun tered. “We’ll name him Aureliano and he’ll win thirty-two wars. ” 
 198GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
After cutting the umbilical cord, the m idwife began to  use a cloth to take off the blue gre ase that 
covered his body as Aur eliano held u p a lamp. Only when they turned him on his stomach did they 
see tha t he h ad somethin g more than  other m en, an d they lea ned over to  examine him . It was the 
tail of a pig. 
They were not alarmed. Aureliano and Amaranta Úr sula were not aware of the family precedent,  
nor did they remember Úrsula’s frightening adm onitions, and the midwi fe pacified them with th e 
idea that th e tail could be cut off when the child got his second teeth. Th en they had no time to  
think about it again, beca use Amaranta Úrsula was bleeding in an uncontain able torrent. They tried  
to help her with applications of spider webs  and balls of ash,  but it was lik e trying to hold back a  
spring with one’s hands. During the first hours she tried to maintain her good humor. She took the 
frightened Aureliano by the hand and  begged him not to worr y, because p eople like her were not 
made to die against their will, and s he exploded with laughter at the ferocious remedies of the 
midwife. But as Aureliano’s hope abandoned him s he was becoming less visible,  as if the light on her 
were fading away, until s he sank into  drowsiness.  At dawn on Monday they brought a woman who 
recited cauterizing prayers that were infallible fo r man and beast beside her bed, but Amaranta 
Úrsula’s passionate blood  was insensible to any ar tifice that di d not come from love. In the after-
noon, after twenty-four hours of desperation, they  knew that she was dead because th e flow ha d 
stopped wi thout remedies  and her profile became s harp and the blotches  on her face evaporated in a 
halo of alabaster and she smiled again. 
Aureliano di d not und erstand until then how mu ch he loved his friends, how much he missed 
them, and how much he would have given to be with them at that momen t. He put the child in the 
basket that his mother had prepared for him, cove red the face of the corpse with a blanket, and  
wandered ai mlessly through the town, searching fo r an entrance that went back to the past. He 
knocked at the door of the pharmacy, where he had not visited lately, an d he found a carpenter  
shop. The old woman who opened the door with a lamp in her hand took  pity on his delirium and 
insisted that,  no, there had never been a pharmac y there, nor had she ever known a woman with a  
thin neck an d sleepy eyes  named  Mercedes. He wept, leaning his brow aga inst the d oor of the wise 
Catalonian’s former bookstore, conscious that he wa s paying with his tard y sobs for a death that he 
had refused to weep for on time so as not to break the spell of love. He smashed his fists against the 
cement wall of The Golden Child, calling for Pilar Te rnera, indifferent to the luminous orange disks  
that were cr ossing the sky and that so many ti mes on holiday nights he had contemplated with 
childish fascination from the courtya rd of the cu rlews. In the last open sa lon of the tumbledown 
red-light dist rict an accordion group was playing th e songs of Rafael Escal ona, the bishop’s nephew, 
heir to the secrets of Francisco the Man. Th e bartender, who had a withered and somewh at 
crumpled arm because h e had raised it against his mother, invited Aureliano  to have a bo ttle of cane 
liquor, and Aureliano then bought him one. The bar tender spoke to him abou t the misfortune of his 
arm. Aureliano spoke to him about the misfortune of his heart, wi thered  and somewh at crumpled  
for having been raised against his sister. They ended up weep ing together and Aureliano felt for a 
moment tha t the p ain was over. But when he was alone agai n in the last dawn of Macondo, he 
opened up his arms in the middle of the square, ready to wake up the whol e world, and he shouted 
with all his might: 
“Friends are a bunch of bastards!” 
Nigromanta rescued him from a pool of vomit an d tears. She took him to her room, cleaned him 
up, made hi m drink a cup of broth. Thinking that it  would con sole him, she took a piece of charcoal  
and erased the innumerable loves that he still owed her for, an d she voluntarily brought  up her own 
most solitary sadnesses so  as not to lea ve him al one in his weepi ng. When he awoke, after  a dull and  
brief sleep, Aureliano recovered the awareness of  his headach e. He open ed his eyes an d remember ed 
the child. 
 199GABRI EL GARCIA MARQ UES  ONE HUNDR ED YEARS OF SOLITUD E 
He could not find the ba sket. At first  he felt an  outburst of joy, thinking t hat Amaranta Úrsula 
had awakened from death to take care of the chil d. But her c orpse was a pile of stone s under the 
blanket. Awa re that when  he arrived h e had fo und the -door to the bedr oom open, Aurel iano went 
across the p orch which was saturated with the m orning sighs of oregano and looked into the dining 
room, where the remnants of the birth  still lay: the large pot, the bloody sheets, the jars o f ashes, and 
the twisted umbilical cord of the child on an opened diaper on the table next to the shears and the 
fishline. The idea that th e midwife had returned for the child during the night gave him a pause of  
rest in which to think. He sank into the rocking chair, the same one in which Rebeca ha d sat during 
the early days of the hou se to give embroidery lessons, and in which Amaranta had pl ayed Chines e 
checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, and in  which Amaranta  Úrsula had sewn the tin y 
clothing for the child, an d in that flas h of lucidity he  beca me aware tha t he was unable to bear in hi s 
soul the crushing weight of so much past. Wounded by  the fatal lances of his own nostalgia and that 
of others, he admired the persistence of the spider  webs on the dead rose bushes, the perseverance 
of the rye grass, the patience of the air in the ra diant February dawn. And then he saw the child. It 
was a dry an d bloated ba g of skin that all the an ts in the world were dragging toward their holes 
along the stone path in the garden. Aureliano could not move. Not beca use he was paralyzed by  
horror but because at that prodigious instant Melquí ades’ final keys were revealed to hi m and he sa w 
the epigraph of the parchments perfectly pla ced in the order of man’s time and space: The first of the 
line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by the ants . 
Aureliano, had never been more lucid in any act of his life as w hen he forgot about his dead ones  
and the pain of his dead  ones and  nailed up the doors and wi ndows again  with Fernan da’s crossed 
boards so as not to be dis turbed by any temptations  of the worl d, for he knew then  that his fate was  
written in Melquíades’ parchments. He found them intact am ong the prehistoric plants and steamin g 
puddles and luminous insects that h ad removed all  trace of ma n’s passage on earth fro m the room, 
and he did n ot have th e calmness to b ring them out into th e light, but right there, standi ng, withou t 
the slightest difficulty, as if th ey had b een written i n Spanish and were being read under the dazzling  
splendor of high noon, he began to d ecipher them al oud. It was the history of the family, written b y 
Melquíades, down to th e most trivial details, one hundred yea rs ahead of time. He had  written it in 
Sanskrit, which was his mother tongue, and he had encoded the even lines in the private cipher o f 
the Emperor Augustus and the odd ones in a La cedemonian military code. The final protection, 
which Aureli ano had begun to glimpse when he l et himself be confused by the love of Amaranta  
Úrsula, was based on the fact that Melquíades had not  put even ts in the order of man’s conventional  
time, but ha d concentra ted a cen tury of daily ep isodes in such a way that they co existed in on e 
instant. Fascinated by the discovery, Aureliano, read aloud without skipping the chanted encyclicals  
that Melquía des himself had made Arcadio listen  to and that were in reality the prediction of hi s 
execution, and he found the announcement of the bi rth of the most beautiful woman in the world 
who was  rising up to heaven in bod y and soul, and he found  the origin o f the posthu mous twins  
who gave up  deciphering the parch ments, not sim ply through incapacity an d lack of drive, but also 
because th eir attemp ts were premature. At that point, impatient to know his own origin, Aurelian o 
skipped ahea d. Then th e wind began, warm, incipien t, full of voices from the past,  the murmurs of  
ancient geraniums, sighs of disenchantment tha t preceded the most tenacio us nostalgia. He did not 
notice it b ecause at that moment h e was discover ing the first indications of his own being in a 
lascivious grandfather who let himself be frivolo usly dragged along across a hallucinated plateau i n
