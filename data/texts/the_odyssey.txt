sing to me of the man muse the man of twists and turns … driven time and again off course once he had plundered the hallowed heights of troy many cities of men he saw and learned their minds many pains he suffered heartsick on the open sea ﬁghting to save his life and bring his comrades home but he could not save them from disaster hard as he strove— the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all the blind fools they devoured the cattle of the sun and the sungod blotted out the day of their return launch out on his story muse daughter of zeus start from where you will—sing for our time too by now all the survivors all who avoided headlong death were safe at home escaped the wars and waves but one man alone … his heart set on his wife and his return—calypso the bewitching nymph the lustrous goddess held him back deep in her arching caverns craving him for a husband but then when the wheeling seas ons brought the year around that year spun out by the gods when he should reach his home ithaca—though not even there would he be free of trials even among his loved ones—then every god took pity all except poseidon he raged on seething against the great odysseus till he reached his native land but now poseidon had gone to visit the ethiopians worlds away ethiopians off at the farthest limits of mankind a people split in two one part where the sungod sets and part where the sungod rises there poseidon went to receive an offering bulls and rams by the hundred— far away at the feast the sealord sat and took his pleasure but the other gods at home in olympian zeus’s halls met for full assembly there and among them now the father of men and gods was ﬁrst to speak sorely troubled remembering handsome aegisthus the man agamemnon’s son renowned orestes killed recalling aegisthus zeus harangued the immortal powers “a h h o w s h a m e l e s s — t h e w a y t h e s e m o r t a l s b l a m e t h e g o d s from us alone they say come all their miseries yes but they themselves with their own reckless ways compound their pains beyond their proper share look at aegisthus now … above and beyond his share he stole atrides’ wife he murdered the warlord coming home from troy though he knew it meant his own total ruin far in advance we told him so ourselves dispatching the guide the giantkiller hermes ‘don’t murder the man’ he said ‘don’t court his wife beware revenge will come from orestes agamemnon’s son that day he comes of age and longs for his native land’ so hermes warned with all the good will in the world but would aegisthus’ hardened heart give way now he pays the price—all at a single stroke” and sparklingeyed athena drove the matter home “father son of cronus our high and mighty king surely he goes down to a death he earned in full let them all die so all who do such things but my heart breaks for odysseus that seasoned veteran cursed by fate so long— far from his loved ones still he suffers torments off on a wavewashed island rising at the center of the seas a dark wooded island and there a goddess makes her home daughter of atlas wicked titan who sounds the deep in all its depths whose shoulders lift on high the colossal pillars thrusting earth and sky apart atlas’ daughter it is wh o holds odysseus captive luckless man—despite his tears forever trying to spellbind his heart with suave seductive words and wipe all thought of ithaca from his mind but he straining for no more than a glimpse of hearthsmoke drifting up from his own land odysseus longs to die … olympian zeus have you no care for him in your lofty heart did he never win your favor with sacriﬁces burned beside the ships on the broad plain of troy why zeus why so dead set against odysseus” “my child” zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied “what nonsense you let slip through your teeth now how on earth could i forget odysseus great odysseus who excels all men in wisdom excels in offerings too he gives the immortal gods who rule the vaulting skies no it’s the earthshaker poseidon unappeased forever fuming against him for the cyclops whose giant eye he blinded godlike polyphemus towering over all the cyclops’ clans in power the nymph thoosa bore him daughter of phorcys lord of the barren salt sea—she met poseidon once in his vaulted caves and they made love and now for his blinded son the earthquake god— though he won’t quite kill odysseus— drives him far off course from native land but come all of us here put heads together now work out his journey home so odysseus can return lord poseidon i trust will let his anger go how can he stand his ground against the will of all the gods at once—one god alone” athena her eyes ﬂashing bright exulted “father son of cronus our high and mighty king if now it really pleases the blissful gods that wise odysseus shall return—home at last— let us dispatch the guide and giantkiller hermes down to ogygia island down to announce at once to the nymph with lovely braids our ﬁxed decree odysseus journeys home—the exile must return while i myself go down to ithaca rouse his son to a braver pitch inspire his heart with courage to summon the ﬂowinghaired achaeans to full assembly speak his mind to all those suitors slaughtering on and on his droves of sheep and shambling longhorn cattle next i will send him off to sparta and sandy pylos there to learn of his dear father’s journey home perhaps he will hear some news and make his name throughout the mortal world” so athena vowed and under her feet she fastened the supple sandals everglowing gold that wing her over the waves and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds she seized the rugged spear tipped with a bronze point— weighted heavy the massive shaft she wields to break the lines of heroes the mighty father’s daughter storms against and down she swept from olympus’ craggy peaks and lit on ithaca standing tall at odysseus’ gates the threshold of his court gripping her bronze spear she looked for all the world like a stranger now like mentes lord of the taphians there she found the swaggering suitors just then amusing themselves with rolling dice before the doors lounging on hides of oxen they had killed themselves while heralds and brisk attendants bustled round them some at the mixingbowls mulling wine and water others wiping the tables do wn with sopping sponges setting them out in place still other servants jointed and carved the great sides of meat first by far to see her was prince telemachus sitting among the suitors heart obsessed with grief he could almost see his magniﬁcent father here … in the mind’s eye—if only he might drop from the clouds and drive these suitors all in a rout throughout the halls and regain his pride of place and rule his own domains daydreaming so as he sat among the suitors he glimpsed athena now and straight to the porch he went mortiﬁed that a guest might still be standing at the doors pausing beside her there he clasped her right hand and relieving her at once of her long bronze spear met her with winged words “greetings stranger here in our house you’ll ﬁnd a royal welcome have supper ﬁrst then tell us what you need” he led the way and pallas athena followed once in the highroofed hall he took her lance and ﬁxed it ﬁrm in a burnished rack against a sturdy pillar there where row on row of spears embattled odysseus’ spears stood stacked and waiting then he escorted her to a high elaborate chair of honor over it draped a cloth and here he placed his guest with a stool to rest her feet but for himself he drew up a low reclining chair beside her richly painted clear of the press of suitors concerned his guest offended by their uproar might shrink from food in the midst of such a mob he hoped what’s more to ask him about his longlost father a maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so they might rinse their hands then pulled a gleaming table to their side a staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them appetizers aplenty too lavish with her bounty a carver lifted platters of meat toward them meats of every sort and set beside them golden cups and time and again a page came round and poured them wine but now the suitors trooped in with all their swagger and took their seats on low and highbacked chairs heralds poured water over their hands for rinsing serving maids brought bread heaped high in trays and the young men brimmed the mixingbowls with wine they reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they’d put aside desire for food and drink the suitors set their minds on other pleasures song and dancing all that crowns a feast a herald placed an ornate lyre in phemius’ hands the bard who always performed among them there they forced the man to sing a rippling prelude— and no sooner had he struck up his rousing song than telemachus head close to athena’s sparkling eyes spoke low to his guest so no one else could hear “dear stranger would you be shocked by what i say look at them over there not a care in the world just lyres and tunes easy for them all right they feed on another’s goods and go scotfree— a man whose white bones lie strewn in the rain somewhere rotting away on land or rolling down the ocean’s salty swells but that man—if they caught sight of him home in ithaca by god they’d all pray to be faster on their feet than richer in bars of gold and heavy robes but now no use he’s died a wretched death no comfort’s left for us … not even if someone somewhere says he’s coming home the day of his return will never dawn enough tell me about yourself now clearly point by point who are you where are you from your city your parents what sort of vessel brought you why did the sailors land you here in ithaca who did they say they are i hardly think you came this way on foot and tell me this for a fact—i need to know— is this your ﬁrst time here or are you a friend of father’s a guest from the old days once crowds of other men would come to our house on visits—visitor that he was when he walked among the living” her eyes glinting goddess athena answered “my whole story of course i’ll tell it point by point wise old anchialus was my father my own name is mentes lord of the taphian men who love their oars and here i’ve come just now with ship and crew sailing the winedark sea to foreign ports of call to temese out for bronze—our cargo gleaming iron our ship lies moored off farmlands far from town riding in rithron cove be neath mount nion’s woods as for the ties between your father and myself we’ve been friends forever i’m proud to say and he would bear me out if you went and questioned old lord laertes he i gather no longer ventures into town but lives a life of hardship all to himself off on his farmstead with an aged servingwoman who tends him well who gives him food and drink when weariness has taken hold of his withered limbs from hauling himself along hi s vineyard’s steep slopes and now i’ve come—and why i heard that he was back … your father that is but no the gods thwart his passage ye t i t e l l y o u g r e a t o d y s s e u s i s n o t d e a d h e ’s s t i l l a l i v e somewhere in this wide world held captive out at sea on a wavewashed island and hard men savages somehow hold him back against his will wait i’ll make you a prophecy one the immortal gods have planted in my mind—it will come true i think though i’m hardly a seer or know the ﬂights of birds he won’t be gone long from the native land he loves not even if iron shackles bind your father down he’s plotting a way to journey home at last he’s never at a loss but come please tell me about yourself now point by point yo u ’r e t r u l y o d y s s e u s ’ s o n yo u ’ v e s p r u n g u p s o uncanny resemblance … the head and the ﬁne eyes— i see him now how often we used to meet in the old days before he embarked for troy where other argive captains all the best men sailed in the long curved ships from then to this very day i’ve not set eyes on odysseus or he on me” and young telemachus cautiously replied “i’ll try my friend to give you a frank answer mother has always told me i’m his son it’s true but i am not so certain who on his own has ever really known who gave him life would to god i’d been the son of a happy man whom old age overtook in th e midst of his possessions now think of the most unlucky mortal ever born— since you ask me yes they say i am his son” “still” the cleareyed goddess reassured him “trust me the gods have not marked out your house for such an unsung future not if penelope has borne a son like you but tell me about all this and spare me nothing what’s this banqueting this crowd carousing here and what part do you play yourself some weddingfeast some festival hardly a potluck supper i would say how obscenely they lounge and swagger here look gorging in your house why any man of sense who chanced among them would be outraged seeing such behavior” ready telemachus took her up at once “well my friend seeing you want to probe and press the question once this house was rich no doubt beyond reproach when the man you mentioned still lived here at home now the gods have reversed our fortunes with a vengeance— wiped that man from the earth like no one else before i would never have grieved so much about his death if he’d gone down with comrades off in troy or died in the arms of loved ones once he had wound down the long coil of war then all united achaea would have raised his tomb and he’d have won his son great fame for years to come but now the whirlwinds have ripped him away no fame for him he’s lost and gone now—out of sight out of mind—and i … he’s left me tears and grief nor do i rack my heart and grieve for him alone no longer now the gods have invented other miseries to plague me listen all the nobles who rule the islands round about dulichion and same and wooded zacynthus too and all who lord it in rocky ithaca as well— down to the last man they court my mother they lay waste my house and mother … she neither rejects a marriage she despises nor can she bear to bring the courting to an end— while they continue to bleed my household white soon—you wait—they’ll grind me down as well” “shameful”— brimming with indignation pallas athena broke out “oh how much you need odysseus gone so long— how he’d lay hands on all these brazen suitors if only he would appear now at his house’s outer gates and take his stand armed with his helmet shield and pair of spears as strong as the man i glimpsed that ﬁrst time in our own house drinking wine and reveling there … just come in from ephyra visiting ilus mermerus’ son odysseus sailed that way you see in his swift trim ship hunting deadly poison to smear on his arrows’ bronze heads ilus refused—he feared the wrath of the everlasting gods— but father so fond of him gave him all he wanted if only that odysseus sported with these suitors a blood wedding a quick death would take the lot true but all lies in the lap of the great gods whether or not he’ll come and pay them back here in his own house but you i urge you think how to drive these suitors from your halls come now listen closely take my words to heart at daybreak summon the island’s lords to full assembly give your orders to all and call the gods to witness tell the suitors to scatter each to his own place as for your mother if the spirit moves her to marry let her go back to her father’s house a man of power her kin will arrange the wedding provide the gifts the array that goes with a daughter dearly loved for you i have some good advice if only you will accept it fit out a ship with twenty oars the best in sight sail in quest of news of your longlost father someone may tell you something or you may catch a rumor straight from zeus rumor that carries news to men like nothing else first go down to pylos question old king nestor then cross over to sparta to redhaired menelaus of all the bronzearmored ac haeans the last man back now if you hear your father’s alive and heading home hardpressed as you are brave out one more year if you hear he’s dead no longer among the living then back you come to the native land you love raise his gravemound build his honors high with the full funeral rites that he deserves— and give your mother to another husband then once you’ve sealed those matters seen them through think hard reach down deep in your heart and soul for a way to kill these suitors in your house by stealth or in open combat y ou must not cling to your boyhood any longer— it’s time you were a man haven’t you heard what glory prince orestes won throughout the world when he killed that cunning murderous aegisthus who’d killed his famous father and you my friend— how tall and handsome i see you now—be brave you too so men to come will sing your praises down the years but now i must go back to my swift trim ship and all my shipmates chaﬁng there i’m sure waiting for my return it all rests with you take my words to heart” “oh stranger” heedful telemachus replied “indeed i will yo u ’ v e c o u n s e l e d m e w i t h s o m u c h k i n d n e s s n o w like a father to a son i won’t forget a word but come stay longer keen as you are to sail so you can bathe and rest and lift your spirits then go back to your ship delighted with a gift a prize of honor something rare and ﬁne as a keepsake from myself the kind of gift a host will give a stranger friend to friend” her eyes glinting pallas declined in haste “not now don’t hold me here i long to be on my way as for the gift—whatever you’d give in kindness— save it for my return so i can take it home choose something rare and ﬁne and a good reward that gift is going to bring you” with that promise off and away athena the brighteyed goddess ﬂew like a bird in soaring ﬂight but left his spirit ﬁlled with nerve and courage charged with his father’s memory more than ever now he felt his senses quicken overwhelmed with wonder— this was a god he knew it well and made at once for the suitors a man like a god himself amidst them still the famous bard sang on and th ey sat in silence listening as he performed the achaeans’ journey home from troy all the blows athena doomed them to endure and now from high above in her room and deep in thought she caught his inspired strains … icarius’ daughter penelope wary and reserved and down the steep stair from her chamber she descended not alone two of her women followed close behind that radiant woman once she reached her suitors drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side suddenly dissolving in tears and bursting through the bard’s inspired voice she cried out “phemius so many other songs you know to hold us spellbound works of the gods and men that singers celebrate sing one of those as you sit beside them here and they drink their wine in silence but break off this song— the unendurable song that always rends the heart inside me … the unforgettable grief it wounds me most of all how i long for my husband—alive in memory always that great man whose fame resounds through hellas right to the depths of argos” “why mother” poised telemachus put in sharply “why deny our devoted bard the chance to entertain us any way the spirit stirs him on bards are not to blame— zeus is to blame he deals to each and every laborer on this earth whatever doom he pleases why fault the bard if he sings the argives’ harsh fate it’s always the latest song the one that echoes last in the listeners’ ears that people praise the most courage mother harden your heart and listen odysseus was scarcely the only one you know whose journey home was blotted out at troy others so many others died there too so mother go back to your quarters tend to your own tasks the distaff and the loom and keep the women working hard as well as for giving orders men will see to that but i most of all i hold the reins of power in this house” astonished she withdrew to her own room she took to heart the clear good sense in what her son had said climbing up to the lofty chamber with her women she fell to weeping for odysseus her beloved husband till watchful athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep but the suitors broke into uproar through the shadowed halls all of them lifting prayers to lie beside her share her bed until discreet telemachus took command “y ou suitors who plague my mother you you insolent overweening … for this evening let us dine and take our pleasure no more shouting now what a ﬁne thing it is to listen to such a bard as we have here— the man sings like a god but at ﬁrst light we all march forth to assembly take our seats so i can give my orders and say to you straight out yo u m u s t l e a v e m y p a l a c e s e e t o y o u r f e a s t i n g e l s e w h e r e devour your own possessions house to house by turns but if you decide the fare is better richer here destroying one man’s goods and going scotfree all right then carve away but i’ll cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes that zeus will pay you back with a vengeance—all of you destroyed in my house while i go scotfree myself” so telemachus declared an d they all bit their lips amazed the prince could speak with so much daring eupithes’ son antinous broke their silence “well telemachus only the gods could teach you to sound so high and mighty such brave talk i pray that zeus will never make you king of ithaca though your father’s crown is no doubt yours by birth” but coolheaded telemachus countered ﬁrmly “a n t i n o u s e v e n t h o u g h m y w o r d s m a y o f f e n d y o u i’d be happy to take the crown if zeus presents it yo u t h i n k t h a t n o t h i n g w o r s e c o u l d b e f a l l a m a n it’s really not so bad to be a king all at once your palace grows in wealth your honors grow as well but there are hosts of other achaean princes look— young and old crowds of them on our island here— and any one of the lot might hold the throne now great odysseus is dead … but i’ll be lord of my own house and servants all that king odysseus won for me by force” and now eurymachus polybus’ son stepped in “surely this must lie in the gods’ lap telemachus— which achaean will lord it over seagirt ithaca do hold on to your own possessions rule your house god forbid that anyone tear your holdings from your hands while men still live in ithaca but about your guest dear boy i have some questions where does he come from where’s his country his birth his father’s old estates did he bring some news of your father his return or did he come on business of his own how he leapt to his feet and off he went no waiting around for proper introductions and no mean man not by the looks of him i’d say” “eurymachus” telemachus answered shrewdly “clearly my father’s journey home is lost forever i no longer trust in rumors—rumors from the blue— nor bother with any prophecy when mother calls some wizard into the house to ask him questions as for the stranger though the man’s an old family friend from taphos wise anchialus’ son he says his name is mentes lord of the taphian men who love their oars” so he said but deep in his mind he knew the immortal goddess now the suitors turned to dance and song to the lovely beat and sway waiting for dusk to come upon them there … and the dark night came upon them lost in pleasure finally to bed each to his own house telemachus off to his bedroom built in the ﬁne courtyard— a commanding lofty room set well apart— retired too his spirit swarming with misgivings his devoted nurse attended him bearing a glowing torch eurycleia the daughter of ops pisenor’s son laertes had paid a price for the woman years ago still in the bloom of youth he traded twenty oxen honored her on a par with his own loyal wife at home but fearing the queen’s anger never shared her bed she was his grandson’s escort now and bore a torch for she was the one of all the maids who loved the prince the most—she’d nursed him as a baby he spread the doors of his snug wellmade room sat down on the bed and pulled his soft shirt off tossed it into the old woman’s conscientious hands and after folding it neatly patting it smooth she hung it up on a peg beside his corded bed then padded from the bedroom drawing the door shut with the silver hook sliding the doorbolt home with its rawhide strap there all night long wrapped in a sheep’s warm ﬂeece he weighed in his mind the course athena charted book ii telemachus sets sail when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more the true son of odysseus sprang from bed and dressed over his shoulder he slung his wellhoned sword fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet and stepped from his bedroom handsome as a god at once he ordered heralds to cry out loud and clear and summon the ﬂowinghaired achaeans to full assembly their cries rang out the people ﬁled in quickly when they’d grouped crowding the meeting grounds telemachus strode in too a bronze spear in his grip and not alone two sleek hounds went trotting at his heels and athena lavished a marvelous splendor on the prince so the people all gazed in wonder as he came forward the elders making way as he took his father’s seat the ﬁrst to speak was an old lord aegyptius stooped with age who knew the world by heart for one dear son had sailed with king odysseus bound in the hollow ships to the stallionland of troy— the spearman antiphus—but the brutal cyclops killed him trapped in his vaulted cave the last man the monster ate three other sons he had one who mixed with the suitors eurynomus and two kept working their father’s farms still he never forgot the soldier desolate in his grief in tears for the son he lost he rose and said among them “hear me men of ithaca hear what i have to say not once have we held assembly met in session since king odysseus sailed in the hollow ships who has summoned us now—one of the young men one of the oldtimers what crisis spurs him on some news he’s heard of an army on the march word he’s caught ﬁrsthand so he can warn us now or some other public matter he’ll disclose and argue he’s a brave man i’d say god be with him too may zeus speed him on to a happy end whatever his heart desires” winning words with a lucky ring odysseus’ son rejoiced the boy could sit no longer—ﬁred up to speak he took his stand among the gathered men the herald pisenor skilled in custom’s ways put the staff in his hand and then the prince addressing old aegyptius ﬁrst led off with “sir that man is not far off—yo u’ll soon see for yourself— i was the one who called us all together something wounds me deeply … not news i’ve heard of an army on the march word i’ve caught ﬁrsthand so i can warn you now or some other public matter i’ll disclose and argue no the crisis is my own trouble has struck my house— a double blow first i have lost my noble father who ruled among you years ago each of you here and kindly as a father to his children but now this a worse disaster that soon will grind my house down ruin it all and all my worldly goods in the bargain suitors plague my mother—against her will— sons of the very men who are your ﬁnest here they’d sooner die than approach her father’s house so icarius himself might see to his daughter’s bridal hand her to whom he likes whoever meets his fancy not they—they infest our palace day and night they butcher our cattle our sheep our fat goats feasting themselves sick swilling our glowing wine as if there’s no tomorrow—all of it squandered now we have no man like odysseus in command to drive this curse from the house we ourselves we’re hardly the ones to ﬁght them off all we’d do is parade our wretched weakness a boy inept at battle oh i’d swing to attack if i had the power in me by god it’s intolerable what they do—disgrace my house a shambles yo u s h o u l d b e a s h a m e d y o u r s e l v e s mortiﬁed in the face of neighbors living round about fear the gods’ wrath—before they wheel in outrage and make these crimes recoil on your heads i beg you by olympian zeus by themis too who sets assemblies free and calls us into session— stop my friends leave me alone to pine away in anguish … unless of course you think my noble father odysseus did the achaean army damage deliberate harm and to pay me back you’d do me in deliberately setting these parasites against me better for me if you were devouring all my treasure all my cattle— if you were the ones we’d make amends in no time we’d approach you for reparations round the town demanding our goods till you’d returned the lot but now look you load my heart with grief— there’s nothing i can do” filled with anger down on the ground he dashed the speaker’s scepter— bursting into tears pity seized the assembly all just sat there silent … no one had the heart to reply with harshness only antinous who found it in himself to say “so high and mighty telemachus—such unbridled rage well now ﬂing your accusations at us think to pin the blame on us yo u t h i n k a g a i n it’s not the suitors here who deserve the blame it’s your own dear mother the matchless queen of cunning look here for three years now getting on to four she’s played it fast and loose with all our hearts building each man’s hopes— dangling promises dropping hints to each— but all the while with something else in mind this was her latest masterpiece of guile she set up a great loom in the royal halls and she began to weave and the weaving ﬁnespun the yarns endless and she would lead us on ‘y oung men my suitors now that king odysseus is no more go slowly keen as you are to marry me until i can ﬁnish off this web … so my weaving won’t all fray and come to nothing this is a shroud for old lord laertes for that day when the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down i dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me yes if a man of such wealth should lie in state without a shroud for cover’ her very words and despite our pride and passion we believed her so by day she’d weave at her great and growing web— by night by the light of torches set beside her she would unravel all she’d done three whole years she deceived us blind seduced us with this scheme … then when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on one of her women in on the queen’s secret told the truth and we caught her in the act—unweaving her gorgeous web so she ﬁnished it off against her will we forced her now telemachus here is how the suitors answer you — you burn it in your mind you and all our people send your mother back direct her to marry whomever her father picks whoever pleases her so long as she persists in tormenting us quick to exploit the gifts athena gave her— a skilled hand for elegant work a ﬁne mind and subtle wiles too—we’ve never heard the like not even in old stories sung of all achaea’s wellcoifed queens who graced the years gone by mycenae crowned with garlands tyro and alcmena … not one could touch penelope for intrigue but in this case she intrigued beyond all limits so we will devour your worldly goods and wealth as long as she holds out holds to that course the gods have charted deep inside her heart great renown she wins for herself no doubt great loss for you in treasure we’ll not go back to our old estates or leave for other parts not till she weds the argive man she fancies” but with calm good sense telemachus replied “a n t i n o u s h o w c a n i d r i v e m y m o t h e r f r o m o u r h o u s e against her will the one who bore me reared me too my father is worlds away dead or alive who knows imagine the high price i’d have to pay icarius if all on my own i send my mother home oh what i would suffer from her father— and some dark god would hurt me even more when mother leaving her own house behind calls down her withering furies on my head and our people’s cries of shame would hound my heels i will never issue that ultimatum to my mother and you if you have any shame in your own hearts you must leave my palace see to your feasting elsewhere devour your own possessions house to house by turns but if you decide the fare is better richer here destroying one man’s goods and going scotfree all right then carve away but i’ll cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes that zeus will pay you back with a vengeance—all of you destroyed in my house while i go scotfree myself” and to seal his prayer farseeing zeus sent down a sign he launched two eagles soaring high from a mountain ridge and down they glided borne on the wind’s draft a moment wing to wingtip pinions straining taut till just above the assembly’s throbbing hum they whirled suddenly wings thrashing wild onslaught of wings and banking down at the crowd’s heads—a glaring fatal sign— talons slashing each other tearing cheeks and throats they swooped away on the right through homes and city all were dumbstruck watching the eagles trail from sight people brooding deeply what might come to pass … until the old warrior halitherses mastor’s son broke the silence for them the one who outperformed all men of his time at reading birdsigns sounding out the omens rose and spoke distraught for each man there “hear me men of ithaca hear what i have to say though my revelations strike the suitors ﬁrst of all— a great disaster is rolling like a breaker toward their heads clearly odysseus won’t be far from loved ones any longer— now right now he’s somewhere near i tell you breeding bloody death for all these suitors here pains aplenty too for the rest of us who live in ithaca’s sunlit air long before that we must put heads together ﬁnd some way to stop these men or let them stop themselves better for them that way by far i myself am no stranger to prophecy—i can see it now odysseus … all is working out for him i say just as i said it would that day the argives sailed for troy and the mastermind of battle boarded with them i said then after many blows and all his shipmates lost after twenty years had wheeled by he would come home unrecognized by all … and now look it all comes to pass” “stop old man” eurymachus polybus’ son rose up to take him on “go home and babble your omens to your children— save them from some catastrophe coming soon i’m a better hand than you at reading portents flocks of birds go ﬂuttering under the sun’s rays not all are fraught with meaning odysseus he’s dead now far from home— would to god that you’d died with him too we’d have escaped your droning prophecies then and the way you’ve loosed the dogs of this boy’s anger— your eyes peeled for a housegift he might give you here’s my prophecy bound to come to pass if you you old codger wise as the ages talk him round incite the boy to riot he’ll be the ﬁrst to suffer let me tell you and you old man we’ll clap some ﬁne on you you’ll weep to pay a ﬁne to crush your spirit telemachus here in front of you all here’s my advice for him let him urge his mother back to her father’s house— her kin will arrange the wedding provide the gifts the array that goes with a daughter dearly loved not till then i’d say will the island princes quit their taxing courtship who’s there to fear i ask you surely not telemachus with all his tiresome threats nor do we balk old man at the prophecies you mouth— they’ll come to grief they’ll make us hate you more the prince’s wealth will be devoured as always mercilessly—no reparations ever … not while the queen drags out our hopes to wed her waiting day after day a ll of us striving hard to win one matchless beauty never courting others bevies of brides who’d suit each noble here” telemachus answered ﬁrm in his resolve “eurymachus—the rest of you ﬁne brazen suitors— i have done with appeals to you about these matters i’ll say no more the gods know how things stand and so do all the achaeans and now all i ask is a good swift ship and a crew of twenty men to speed me through my passage out and back i’m sailing off to sparta sandy pylos too for news of my longlost father’s journey home someone may tell me something or i may catch a rumor straight from zeus rumor that carries news to men like nothing else now if i hear my father’s alive and heading home hardpressed as i am i’ll brave out one more year if i hear he’s dead no longer among the living then back i’ll come to the native land i love raise his gravemound build his honors high with the full funeral rites that he deserves— and give my mother to another husband” a declaration and the prince sat down as mentor took the ﬂoor odysseus’ friendinarms to whom the king sailing off to troy committed his household ordering one and all to obey the old man and he would keep things steadfast and secure with deep concern for the realm he rose and warned “hear me men of ithaca hear what i have to say never let any sceptered king be kind and gentle now not with all his heart or set his mind on justice— no let him be cruel and always practice outrage think not one of the people whom he ruled remembers odysseus now that godlike man and kindly as a father to his children i don’t grudge these arrogant suitors for a moment weaving their violent work with all their wicked hearts— they lay their lives on the line when they consume odysseus’ worldly goods blind in their violence telling themselves that he’ll come home no more but all the rest of you how you rouse my fury sitting here in silence … never a word put forth to curb these suitors paltry few as they are and you so many” “mentor” euenor’s son leocritus rounded on him shouting “rabblerousing fool now what’s this talk goading them on to try and hold us back it’s uphill work i warn you ﬁghting a force like ours—for just a meal even if odysseus of ithaca did arrive in person to ﬁnd us wellbred suitors feasting in his halls and the man were hellbent on routing us from the palace— little joy would his wife derive from his return for all her yearning here on the spot he’d meet a humiliating end if he fought against such odds yo u ’r e t a l k i n g n o n s e n s e — i d i o c y no more come dissolve the assembly each man return to his holdings mentor and halitherses can speed our young prince on his father’s doddering friends since time began he’ll sit tight a good long while i trust scrabbling for news right here in ithaca— he’ll never make that trip” this broke up the assembly keen to leave the people scattered quickly each to his own house while the suitors strolled back to king odysseus’ palace telemachus walking the beach now far from others washed his hands in the foaming surf and prayed to pallas “dear god hear me y esterday you came to my house you told me to ship out on the misty sea and learn if father gone so long is ever coming home … look how my countrymen—the suitors most of all the pernicious bullies—foil each move i make” athena came to his prayer from close at hand for all the world with mentor’s build and voice and she urged him on with winging words “telemachus you’ll lack neither courage nor sense from this day on not if your father’s spirit courses through your veins— now there was a man i’d say in words and action both so how can your journey end in shipwreck or defeat only if you were not his stock penelope’s too then i’d fear your hopes might come to grief few sons are the equals of their fathers most fall short all too few surpass them but you brave and adept from this day on— odysseus’ cunning has hardly given out in you — there’s every hope that you will reach your goal put them out of your mind thes e suitors’ schemes and plots they’re madmen not a shred of sense or decency in the crowd nor can they glimpse the deat h and black doom hovering just at their heads to crush them all in one short day but you the journey that stirs you now is not far off not with the likes of me your father’s friend and yours to rig you a swift ship and be your shipmate too now home you go and mix with the suitors there but get your rations ready pack them all in vessels the wine in jars and barleymeal—the marrow of men’s bones— in durable skins while i make rounds in town and quickly enlist your crew of volunteers lots of ships in seagirt ithaca old and new i’ll look them over choose the best in sight we’ll ﬁt her out and launch her into the sea at once” and so athena daughter of zeus assured him no lingering now—he heard the goddess’ voice— but back he went to his house with aching heart and there at the palace found the brazen suitors skinning goats in the courtyard singeing pigs for roasting antinous smiling warmly sauntered up to the prince grasped his hand and coaxed him savoring his name “telemachus my high and mighty ﬁerce young friend no more nursing those violent words and actions now come eat and drink with us just like the old days whatever you want our people will provide a ship and a picked crew to speed you to holy pylos out for the news about your noble father” but selfpossessed telemachus drew the line “a n t i n o u s n o w h o w c o u l d i d i n e w i t h y o u i n p e a c e and take my pleasure y ou rufﬁans carousing here isn’t it quite enough that you my mother’s suitors have ravaged it all my very best these many years while i was still a boy but now that i’m fullgrown and can hear the truth from others absorb it too— now yes that the anger seethes inside me … i’ll stop at nothing to hurl destruction at your heads whether i go to pylos or sit tight here at home but the trip i speak of will not end in failure go i will as a passenger nothing more since i don’t seem to command my own crew that i’m sure is the way that suits you best” with this he nonchalantly drew his hand from antinous’ hand while the suitors busy feasting in the halls mocked and taunted him ﬂinging insults now “god help us” one young buck kept shouting “he wants to slaughter us all he’s off to sandy pylos to hire cutthroats even sparta perhaps so hot to have our heads why he’d rove as far as ephyra’s dark rich soil and run back home with lethal poison slip it into the bowl and wipe us out with drink” “who knows” another young blade up and ventured “off in that hollow ship of his he just might drown far from his friends a drifter like his father what a bore he’d double our work for us splitting up his goods parceling out his house to his mother and the man who weds the queen” so they scoffed but telemachus headed down to his father’s storeroom broad and vaulted piled high with gold and bronze chests packed with clothing vats of redolent oil and there standing in close ranks against the wall were jars of seasoned mellow wine holding the drink unmixed inside them ﬁt for a god waiting the day odysseus worn by hardships might come home again doors snugly ﬁtted doubly hung were bolted shut and a housekeeper was in charge by night and day— her care her vigilance guarding all those treasures— eurycleia the daughter of ops pisenor’s son telemachus called her into the storeroom “come nurse draw me off some wine in smaller traveling jars mellow the ﬁnest vintage you’ve been keeping next to what you reserve for our unlucky king— in case odysseus might drop in from the blue and cheat the deadly spirits make it home fill me an even dozen seal them tightly pour me barley in wellstitched leather bags twenty measures of meal your stoneground best but no one else must know these rations now put them all together i’ll pick them up myself toward evening just about the time that mother climbs to her room and thinks of turning in i’m sailing off to sparta sandy pylos too for news of my dear father’s journey home perhaps i’ll catch some rumor” a wail of grief— and his fond old nurse burst out in protest sobbing “why dear child what craziness got into your head why bent on rambling over the face of the earth— a darling only son y our father’s worlds away god’s own odysseus dead in some strange land and these brutes here just wait the moment you’re gone they’ll all be scheming against you kill you by guile they will and carve your birthright up in pieces no sit tight here guard your own things here don’t go roving over the barren salt sea— no need to suffer so” “courage old woman” thoughtful telemachus tried to reassure her “there’s a god who made this plan but swear you won’t say anything to my mother not till ten or a dozen days have passed or she misses me herself and learns i’m gone she mustn’t mar her lovely face with tears” the old one swore a solemn oath to the gods and vowing she would never breathe a word quickly drew off wine in twoeared jars and poured barley in wellstitched leather bags telemachus returned to the hall and joined the suitors then brighteyed pallas thought of one more step disguised as the prince the goddess roamed through town pausing beside each likely crewman giving orders “gather beside our ship at nightfall—be there” she asked noëmon phronius’ generous son to lend her a swift ship he gladly volunteered the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark now the goddess hauled the swift ship down to the water stowed in her all the tackle wellrigged vessels carry moored her well away at the harbor’s very mouth and once the crew had gathered rallying round she heartened every man then brighteyed pallas thought of one last thing back she went to king odysseus’ halls and there she showered sweet oblivion over the suitors dazing them as they drank knocking cups from hands no more loitering now their eyes weighed down with sleep they rose and groped through town to ﬁnd their beds but calling the prince outside his timbered halls taking the build and voice of mentor once again ﬂashingeyed athena urged him on “telemachus your comradesatarms are ready at the oars waiting for your command to launch so come on with our voyage now we’re wasting time” and pallas athena sped away in the lead as he followed in her footsteps man and goddess once they reached the ship at the water’s edge they found their longhaire d shipmates on the beach the prince inspired gave his ﬁrst commands “come friends get the rations aboard they’re piled in the palace now my mother knows nothing of this no servants either only one has heard our plan” he led them back and the men fell in and fetched down all the stores and stowed them briskly deep in the wellribbed holds as odysseus’ son directed telemachus climbed aboard athena led the way assuming the pilot’s seat reserved astern and he sat close beside her cables cast off the crew swung to the oarlocks brighteyed athena sent them a stiff following wind rippling out of the west rufﬂ ing over the winedark sea as telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates “a l l l a y h a n d s t o t a c k l e ” t h e y s p r a n g t o o r d e r s hoisting the pinewood mast they stepped it ﬁrm in its block amidships lashed it fast with stays and with braided rawhide halyar ds hauled the white sail high suddenly wind hit full and the canvas bellied out and a dark blue wave foaming up at the bow sang out loud and strong as the ship made way skimming the whitecaps cutting toward her goal all running gear secure in the swift black craft they set up bowls and brimmed them high with wine and poured libations out to the everlasting gods who never die—to athena ﬁrst of all the daughter of zeus with ﬂashing seagray eyes— and the ship went plunging all night long and through the dawn book iii king nestor remembers as the sun sprang up leaving the brilliant waters in its wake climbing the bronze sky to shower light on immortal gods and mortal men across the pl owlands ripe with grain— the ship pulled into pylos neleus’ storied citadel where the people lined the beaches sacriﬁcing sleek black bulls to poseidon god of the seablue mane who shakes the earth they sat in nine divisions each ﬁve hundred strong each division offering up nine bulls and while the people tasted the innards burned the thighbones for the god the craft and crew came heading straight to shore striking sail furling it in the balanced ship they moored her well and men swung down on land telemachus climbed out last athena far in front and the brighteyed goddess urged the prince along “telemachus no more shyness this is not the time we sailed the seas for this for news of your father— where does he lie buried what fate did he meet so go right up to nestor breaker of horses we’ll make him yield the secrets of his heart press him yourself to tell the whole truth he’ll never lie—the man is far too wise” the prince replied wise in his own way too “how can i greet him mentor even approach the king i’m hardly adept at subtle conversation someone my age might feel shy what’s more interrogating an older man” “telemachus” the brighteyed goddess athena reassured him “some of the words you’ll ﬁnd within yourself the rest some power will inspire you to say yo u l e a s t o f a l l — i k n o w — were born and reared without the gods’ good will” and pallas athena sped away in the lead as he followed in her footsteps—man and goddess gained the place where the pylians met and massed there sat nestor among his sons as friends around them decked the banquet roasted meats and skewered strips for broiling as soon as they saw the strang ers all came crowding down waving them on in welcome urging them to sit nestor’s son pisistratus ﬁrst to reach them grasped their hands and sat them down at the feast on ﬂeecy throws spread ou t along the sandbanks ﬂanking his brother thrasymedes and his father he gave them a share of innards poured some wine in a golden cup and lifting it warmly toward athena daughter of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder greeted the goddess now with an invitation “say a prayer to lord poseidon stranger his is the feast you’ve found on your arrival but once you’ve made your libation and your prayer— all according to ancient custom—hand this cup of hearty seasoned wine to your comrade here so he can pour forth too he too i think should pray to the deathless ones himself all men need the gods … but the man is younger just about my age that’s why i give the gold cup ﬁrst to you” with that pisistratus placed in her hand the cup of mellow wine and pallas rejoiced at the prince’s sense of tact in giving the golden winecup ﬁrst to her at once she prayed intensely to poseidon “hear me sealord you who embrace the earth— don’t deny our wishes bring our prayers to pass first then to nestor and all his sons grant glory then to all these pylians for their splendid rites grant a reward that warms their gracious hearts last poseidon grant telemachus and myself safe passage home the mission accomplished that sped us here in our rapid black ship” so she prayed and brought it all to pass she offered the rich twohandled cup to telemachus odysseus’ son who echoed back her prayer word for word they roasted the prime cuts pulled them off the spits and sharing out the portions fell to the royal feast once they’d put aside desire for food and drink old nestor the noble charioteer began at last “now’s the time now they’ve enjoyed their meal to probe our guests and ﬁnd out who they are strangers—friends who are you where did you sail from over the running sealanes out on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates seawolves raiding at will who risk their lives to plunder other men” poised telemachus answered ﬁlled with heart the heart athena herself inspired to ask for the news about his father gone so long and make his name throughout the mortal world “nestor son of neleus achaea’s pride and glory— where are we from you ask i will tell you all we hail from ithaca under the heights of nion our mission here is personal nothing public now i am on the trail of my father’s widespread fame you see searching the earth to catch some news of greathearted king odysseus who they say fought with you to demolish troy some years ago about all the rest who fought the trojans there we know where each one died his wretched death but father … even his death— the son of cronus shrouds it all in mystery no one can say for certain where he died whether he went down on land at enemy hands or out on the open sea in amphitrite’s breakers that’s why i’ve come to plead before you now if you can tell me about his cruel death perhaps you saw him die with your own eyes or heard the wanderer’s end from someone else more than all other men that man was born for pain don’t soften a thing from pity respect for me— tell me clearly all your eyes have witnessed i beg you—if ever my father lord odysseus pledged you his word and made it good in action once on the ﬁelds of troy where you achaeans suffered remember his story now tell me the truth” nestor the noble charioteer replied at length “a h d e a r b o y s i n c e y o u c a l l b a c k s u c h m e m o r i e s such living hell we endured in distant troy— we headstrong ﬁghting forces of achaea— so many raids from shipboard down the foggy sea cruising for plunder wherever achilles led the way so many battles round king priam’s walls we fought so many gone our best and bravest fell there ajax lies the great man of war there lies achilles too there patroclus skilled as the gods in counsel and there my own dear son both strong and staunch antilochus—lightning on his feet and every inch a ﬁghter but so many other things we suffered past that count— what mortal in this wide world could tell it all not if you sat and probed his memory ﬁve six years delving for all the pains our brave achaeans bore there yo u r p a t i e n c e w o u l d f r a y y o u ’ d s o o n h e a d f o r h o m e … nine years we wove a web of disaster for those trojans pressing them hard with every tactic known to man and only after we slaved did zeus award us victory and no one there could hope to rival odysseus not for sheer cunning— at every twist of strategy he excelled us all yo u r f a t h e r y e s i f y o u a r e i n f a c t h i s s o n … i look at you and a sense of wonder takes me y our way with words—it’s just like his—i’d swear no youngster could ever speak like you so apt so telling as long as i and great odysseus soldiered there never once did we speak out at odds neither in open muster nor in royal council forever one in mind in judgment balanced shrewd we mapped our armies’ plans so things might turn out best but then once we’d sacked king priam’s craggy city zeus contrived in his heart a fatal homeward run for all the achaeans who were fools at least dishonest too so many met a disastrous end thanks to the lethal rage of the mighty father’s daughter eyes aﬁre athena set them feuding atreus’ two sons … they summoned all the achaean ranks to muster rashly just at sunset—no hour to rally troops— and in they straggled sodden with wine our heroes the brothers harangued them told them why they’d met a crisis—menelaus urging the men to ﬁx their minds on the voyage home across the sea’s broad back but it brought no joy to agamemnon not at all he meant to detain us there and offer victims anything to appease athena’s dreadful wrath— poor fool he never dreamed athena would not comply the minds of the everlasting go ds don’t change so quickly so the two of them stood there wrangling back and forth till the armies sprang up their armor clashing ungodly uproar— two plans split the ranks that night we barely slept seething with hard feelings against our own comrades for zeus was brooding over us poised to seal our doom … at dawn half of us hauled our vessels down to sea we stowed our plunder our sashed and lovely women but half the men held back camped on the beach waiting it out for agamemnon’s next commands while our contingent embarked— we pushed off and sailed at a fast clip as a god smoothed out the huge troughing swells we reached tenedos quickly sacriﬁced to the gods the crews keen for home but a quick return was not in zeus’s plans not yet that cruel power loosed a cursed feud on us once again some swung their rolling warships hard about— odysseus sailed them back the ﬂexible wily king veering over to agamemnon now to shore his fortunes up not i massing the ships that came in my ﬂotilla i sped away as the god’s mischief kept on brewing dawning on me now and tydeus’ ﬁghting son diomedes ﬂed too rousing all his comrades late in the day the redhaired menelaus joined us overtook us at lesbos debating the long route home whether to head north over the top of rocky chios skirting psyrie keeping that island off to port or run south of chios by mimas’ gusty cape we asked the god for a sign he showed us one he urged us to cut out on the middle passage straight to euboea now escape a catastrophe fa st as we could sail a shrilling wind came up stiff driving us on and on we raced over the sealanes rife with ﬁsh and we made geraestus point in the dead of night many thighs of bulls we offered poseidon there— thank god we’d crossed that endless reach of sea then on the fourth day out the crews of diomedes breaker of horses moored their balanced ships at argos port but i held course for pylos yes and never once did the good strong wind go limp from the ﬁrst day the god unleashed its blast and so dear boy i made it home from troy in total ignorance knowing nothing of their fates the ones who stayed behind who escaped with their lives and who went down but all i’ve gathered by hearsay sitting here in my own house—that you’ll learn it’s only right i’ll hide nothing now they say the myrmidons those savage spearmen led by the shining son of lionhearted achilles traveled home unharmed philoctetes the gallant son of poias safe as well idomeneus brought his whole contingent back to crete all who’d escaped the war—the sea snatched none from him but atreus’ son agamemnon … you yourselves even in faroff ithaca must have heard how he returned how aegisthus hatched the king’s horrendous death but what a price he paid in blood in suffering ah how ﬁne it is when a man is brought down to leave a son behind orestes took revenge he killed that cunning murderous aegisthus who’d killed his famous father and you my friend— how tall and handsome i see you now—be brave you too so men to come will sing your praises down the years” telemachus weighing the challenge closely answered “oh nestor son of neleus achaea’s pride and glory what a stroke of revenge that was all achaeans will spread orestes’ fame across the world a song for those to come if only the gods would arm me in such power i’d take revenge on the lawless brazen suitors riding roughshod over me plotting reckless outrage but for me the gods have spun out no such joy for my father or myself i must bear up that’s all” and the old charioteer replied “now that you mention it dear boy i do recall a mob of suitors they say besets your mother there in your own house against your will and plots your ruin tell me though do you let yourself be so abused or do people round about stirred up by the prompting of some god despise you now who knows if he will return someday to take revenge on all their violence singlehanded perhaps or with an argive army at his back if only the brighteyed goddess chose to love you just as she lavished care on brave odysseus years ago in the land of troy where we achaeans struggled i’ve never seen the immortals show so much affection as pallas openly showed him standing by your father— if only she’d favor you tend you with all her heart many a suitor then would lose all thought of marriage blotted out forever” “never your majesty” telemachus countered gravely “that will never come to pass i know what you say dumbfounds me staggers imagination hope hope as i will that day will never dawn … not even if the gods should will it so” “telemachus” pallas athena broke in sharply her eyes aﬁre— “what’s this nonsense slipping through your teeth it’s light work for a willing god to save a mortal even half the world away myself i’d rather sail through years of trouble and labor home and see that blessed day than hurry home to die at my own hearth like agamemnon killed by aegisthus’ cu nning—by his own wife but the great leveler death not even the gods can defend a man not even one they love that day when fate takes hold and lays him out at last” “mentor” wise telemachus said “distraught as we are for him let’s speak of this no more my father’s return it’s inconceivable now long ago the undying gods have sealed his death his black doom but now there’s another question i would put to nestor nestor excels all men for sense and justice his knowledge of the world three generations he has ruled they say and to my young eyes he seems a deathless god nestor son of neleus tell me the whole story— how did the great king agamemnon meet his death where was menelaus what fatal trap did he set that treacherous aegisthus to bring down a man far stronger than himself was menelaus gone from achaean argos roving the world somewhere so the coward found the nerve to kill the king” and old nestor the noble charioteer replied “gladly my boy i’ll tell you the story ﬁrst to last … right you are you guess what would have happened if redhaired menelaus arriving back from troy had found aegisthus alive in agamemnon’s palace no barrow piled high on the earth for his dead body no the dogs and birds would have feasted on his corpse sprawled on the plain outside the city gates and no one no woman in all achaea would have wept a moment such a monstrous crime the man contrived but there we were camped at troy battling out the long hard campaign while he at his ease at home in the depths of argos stallioncountry—he lay siege to the wife of agamemnon luring enticing her with talk at ﬁrst true she spurned the idea of such an outrage clytemnestra the queen her will was faithful still and there was a man what’s more a bard close by to whom agamemnon setting sail for troy gave strict commands to guard his wife but then that day the doom of the gods had bound her to surrender aegisthus shipped the bard away to a desert island marooned him there sweet prize for the birds of prey and swept her off to his own house lover lusting for lover and many thighbones he burne d on the gods’ holy altars many gifts he hung on the temple walls—gold brocades— in thanks for a conquest past his maddest hopes now we you see were sailing home from troy in the same squadron menelaus and i comradesinarms from years of war but as we rounded holy sounion athens’ headland lord apollo attacked atrides’ helmsman aye with his gentle shafts he shot the man to death— an iron grip on the tiller the craft scudding fast— phrontis onetor’s son who excelled all men alive at steering ships when gales bore down in fury so menelaus straining to sail on was held back till he could bury his mate with ﬁtting rites but once he’d got off too plowing the winedark sea in his ribbed ships and made a run to malea’s beetling cape farseeing zeus decided to give the man rough sailing poured a hurricane down upon him shrilling winds giant rearing whitecaps monstrous mountains high there at a stroke he cut the ﬂeet in half and drove one wing to crete where cydonians make their homes along the iardanus river now there’s a sheer cliff plunging steep to the surf at the farthest edge of gortyn out on the mistbound sea where the south wind piles breakers huge ones left of the headland’s horn toward phaestos with only a low reef to block the crushing tides in they sailed and barely escaped their death— the ships’ crews that is— the rollers smashed their hulls against the rocks but as for the other ﬁve with pitchblack prows the wind and current swept them on toward egypt so menelaus amassing a hoard of stores and gold was off cruising his ships to foreign ports of call while aegisthus hatched his vicious work at home seven years he lorded over mycenae rich in gold once he’d killed agamemnon—he ground the people down but the eighth year ushered in his ruin prince orestes home from athens yes he cut him down that cunning murderous aegisthus who’d killed his famous father vengeance done he held a feast for the argives to bury his hated mother craven aegisthus too the very day menelaus arrived lord of the warcry freighted with all the wealth his ships could carry so you dear boy take care don’t rove from home too long too far leaving your own holdings unprotected— crowds in your palace so brazen they’ll carve up all your wealth devour it all and then your journey here will come to nothing still i advise you urge you to visit menelaus he’s back from abroad at last from people so removed you might abandon hope of ever returning home once the winds had driven you that far off course into a sea so vast not even cranes could wing their way in one year’s ﬂight—so vast it is so awesome … so off you go with your ships and shipmates now or if you’d rather go by land there’s team and chariot my sons at your service too and they’ll escort you to sunny lacedaemon home of the redhaired king press him yourself to tell the whole truth he’ll never lie—the man is far too wise” so he closed as the sun set and darkness swept across the earth and the brighteyed goddess pallas spoke for all “there was a tale old soldier so well told come cut out the victims’ tongues and mix the wine so once we’ve poured libations out to the sealord and every other god we’ll think of sleep high time— the light’s already sunk in the western shadows it’s wrong to linger long at the gods’ feast we must be on our way” zeus’s daughter— they all hung closely on every word she said heralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine they tipped ﬁrst drops for the god in every cup then poured full rounds for all they rose and ﬂung the victims’ tongues on the ﬁre and poured libations out when they’d poured and drunk to their hearts’ content athena and prince telemachus both started up to head for their ship at once but nestor held them there objecting strongly “zeus forbid—and the other deathless gods as well— that you resort to your ship and put my house behind like a rank pauper’s without a stitch of clothing no piles of rugs no blankets in his place for host and guests to slumber soft in comfort why i’ve plenty of ﬁne rugs and blankets here no by god the true son of my good friend odysseus won’t bed down on a ship’s deck not while i’m alive or my sons are left at home to host our guests whoever comes to our palace newfound friends” “dear old man you’re right” athena exclaimed her eyes brightening now “telemachus should oblige yo u much the better way let him follow you now sleep in your halls but i’ll go back to our trim black ship hearten the crew and give each man his orders i’m the only veteran in their ranks i tell you all the rest of an age with brave telemachus are younger men who sailed with him as friends i’ll bed down there by the dark hull tonight at dawn push off for the proud cauconians those people owe me a debt long overdue and no mean sum believe me but you seeing my friend is now your guest speed him on his way with a chariot and your son and give him the ﬁnest horses that you have bred for stamina trained to race the wind” with that the brighteyed goddess winged away in an eagle’s form and ﬂight amazement fell on all the achaeans there the old king astonished by what he’d seen grasped telemachus’ hand and cried out to the prince “dear boy—never fear you’ll be a coward or defenseless not if at your young age the gods will guard you so of all who dwell on olympus this was none but she zeus’s daughter the glorious one his third born who prized your gallant father among the argives now o queen be gracious give us high renown myself my children my loyal wife and queen i will make you a sacriﬁce a yearling heifer broad in the brow unbroken never yoked by men i’ll offer it up to you—i’ll sheathe its horns in gold” so he prayed and pallas athena heard his prayer and nestor the noble chariotdriver led them on his sons and sonsinlaw back to his regal palace once they reached the storied halls of the aged king they sat on rows of low and highbacked chairs as they arrived the old man mixed them all a bowl stirring the hearty wine seasoned eleven years before a servant broached it loosed its seal mulling it in the bowl old nestor poured a libation out praying hard to pallas athena daughter of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder once they had poured their offerings drunk their ﬁll the pylians went to rest each in his own house but the noble chariotdriver let telemachus king odysseus’ son sleep at the palace now on a corded bed inside the echoing colonnade with prince pisistratus there beside him the young spearman already captain of armies though the last son still unwed within the halls the king retired to chambers deep in his lofty house where the queen his wife arranged and shared their bed when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more old nestor the noble chariotdriver climbed from bed went out and took his seat on the polished stones a bench glistening white rubbed with glossy oil placed for the king before his looming doors there neleus held his sessions years ago a match for the gods in counsel but his fate had long since forced him down to death now royal nestor in turn achaea’s watch and ward sat there holding the scepter while his sons coming out of their chambers clustered round him hovering near echephron stratius perseus and aretus thrasymedes like a god and sixth young lord pisistratus came to join their ranks they escorted prince telemachus in to sit beside them nestor noble charioteer began the celebration “quickly my children ca rry out my wishes now so i may please the gods athena ﬁrst of all— she came to me at poseidon’s ﬂowing feast athena in all her glory now someone go to the ﬁelds to fetch a heifer lead her here at once—a herdsman drive her in someone hurry down to prince telemachus’ black ship bring up all his crewmen leave just two behind and another tell our goldsmith skilled laerces to come and sheathe the heifer’s horns in gold the rest stay here together tell the maids inside the hall to prepare a sumptuous feast— bring seats and ﬁrewood bring pure water too” they all pitched in to carry out his orders the heifer came from the ﬁelds the crewmen came from brave telemachus’ ship and the smith came in with all his gear in hand the tools of his trade the anvil hammer and wellwrought tongs he used for working gold and athena came as well to attend her sacred rites the old horseman passed the gold to the smith and twining the foil he sheathed the heifer’s horns so the goddess’ eyes might dazzl e delighted with the gift next stratius and echephron led the beast by the horns aretus coming up from the storeroom brought them lustral water ﬁlling a ﬂowerbraided bowl in his other hand the barley in a basket thrasymedes staunch in combat stood ready whetted ax in his grasp to cut the heifer down and perseus held the basin for the blood now nestor the old charioteer began the rite pouring the lustral water scattering barleymeal he lifted up his ardent prayers to pallas athena launching the sacriﬁce ﬂinging onto the ﬁre the ﬁrst tufts of hair from the victim’s head prayers said the scattering barley strewn suddenly nestor’s son impetuous thrasymedes strode up close and struck—the ax chopped the neck tendons through— and the blow stunned the heifer’s strength— the women shrilled their cry nestor’s daughters sons’ wives and his own loyal wife eurydice clymenus’ eldest daughter then hoisting up the victim’s head from the trampled earth they held her fast as the captain of men pisistratus slashed her throat dark blood gushed forth life ebbed from her limbs— they quartered her quickly cut the thighbones out and all according to custom wrapped them round in fat a double fold sliced clean an d topped with strips of ﬂesh and the old king burned th ese over dried split wood and over the ﬁre poured out glistening wine while young men at his side held ﬁvepronged forks once they’d burned the bones and tasted the organs they sliced the rest into pi eces spitted them on skewers and raising points to the ﬁre broiled all the meats during the ritual lovely po lycaste youngest daughter of nestor neleus’ son had bathed telemachus rinsing him off now rubbing him down with oil she drew a shirt and handsome cape around him out of his bath he stepped glowing like a god strode in and sat by the old commander nestor they roasted the prime cuts pulled them off the spits and sat down to the feast while ready stewards saw to rounds of wine and kept the gold cups ﬂowing when they’d put aside desire for food and drink nestor the noble chariotdriver issued orders “hurry my boys bring telemachus horses a good fullmaned team— hitch them to a chariot—he must be off at once” they listened closely snapped to his commands and hitched a rapid team to a chariot’s yoke in haste a housekeeper stowed some bread and wine aboard and meats too food ﬁt for the sons of kings telemachus vaulted onto the splendid chariot— right beside him nestor’s son pisistratus captain of armies boarded seized the reins whipped the team to a run and on the horses ﬂew holding nothing back out into open country leaving the heights of pylos fading in their trail shaking the yoke across their shoulders all day long the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark as they reached phera pulling up to diodes’ halls the son of ortilochus son of the alpheus river he gave them a royal welcome there they slept the night when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more they yoked their pair again mounted the blazoned car and out through the gates and echoing colonnade they whipped the team to a run and on they ﬂew holding nothing back—and the princes reached the wheatlands straining now for journey’s end so fast those purebred stallions raced them on as the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark book iv the king and queen of sparta at last they gained the ravines of lacedaemon ringed by hills and drove up to the halls of menelaus in his glory they found the king inside his palace celebrating with throngs of kinsmen a double weddingfeast for his son and lovely daughter the princess he was sending on to the son of great achilles breaker of armies y ears ago menelaus vowed he nodded assent at troy and pledged her hand and now the gods were sealing ﬁrm the marriage so he was sending her on her way with team and chariot north to the myrmidons’ famous city governed by her groom from sparta he brought alector’s daughter as the bride for his own fullgrown son the hardy megapenthes born to him by a slave to helen the gods had granted no more offspring once she had borne her ﬁrst child the breathtaking hermione a luminous beauty gold as aphrodite so now they feasted within the grand highroofed palace all the kin and clansmen of menelaus in his glory reveling warmly here as in their midst an inspired bard sang out and struck his lyre— and through them a pair of tumblers dashed and sprang whirling in leaping handsprings leading on the dance the travelers nestor’s shining son and prince telemachus had brought themselves and their horses to a standstill just outside the court when good lord eteoneus passing through the gates now saw them there and the ready aideinarms of menelaus took the message through his sovereign’s halls and stepping close to his master broke the news “strangers have just arrived your majesty menelaus two men but they look like ki n of mighty zeus himself tell me should we unhitch their team for them or send them to someone free to host them well” the redhaired king took great offense at that “never a fool before eteoneus son of boëthous now i see you’re babbling like a child just think of all the hospitality we enjoyed at the hands of other men before we made it home and god save us from such hard treks in years to come quick unhitch their team and bring them in strangers guests to share our ﬂowing feast” back through the halls he hurried calling out to other brisk attendants to follow quickly they loosed the sweating team from under the yoke tethered them fast by reins inside the horsestalls tossing feed at their hoofs white barley mixed with wheat and canted the chariot up against the polished walls shimmering in the sun then ushered in their guests into that magniﬁcent place both struck by the sight they marveled up and down the house of the warlord dear to zeus— a radiance strong as the moon or rising sun came ﬂooding through the highroofed halls of illustrious menelaus once they’d feasted their eyes with gazing at it all into the burnished tubs they climbed and bathed when women had washed them rubbed them down with oil and drawn warm ﬂeece and shir ts around their shoulders they took up seats of honor next to atrides menelaus a maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so they might rinse their hands then pulled a gleaming table to their side a staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them appetizers aplenty too lavish with her bounty as a carver lifted platters of meat toward them meats of every sort and set before them golden cups the redhaired king menelaus greeted both guests warmly “help yourselves to food and welcome once you’ve dined we’ll ask you who you are but your parents’ blood is hardly lost in you y ou must be born of kings bred by the gods to wield the royal scepter no mean men could sire sons like you” with those words he passed them a fat rich loin with his own hands the choicest part that he’d been served himself they reached for the good things that lay outspread and when they’d put aside desire for food and drink telemachus leaning his head close to nestor’s son spoke low to the prince so no one else could hear “look pisistratus—joy of my heart my friend— the sheen of bronze the blaze of gold and amber silver ivory too through all this echoing mansion surely zeus’s court on olympus must be just like this the boundless glory of all this wealth inside my eyes dazzle … i am struck with wonder” but the redhaired warlord overheard his guest and cut in quickly with winged words for both “no man alive could rival zeus dear boys with his everlasting palace and possessions but among men i must say few if any could rival me in riches believe me much i suffered many a mile i roved to haul such treasures home in my ships eight years out wandering off as far as cyprus phoenicia even egypt i reached the ethiopians sidonians erembians—libya too where lambs no sooner spring from the womb than they grow horns three times in the circling year the ewes give birth so no one neither king nor shepherd could want for cheese or mutton or sweet milk either udders swell for the sucklings round the year but while i roamed those lands amassing a fortune a stranger killed my brother blind to the danger duped blind— thanks to the cunning of his cursed murderous queen so i rule all this wealth with no great joy yo u m u s t h a v e h e a r d m y s t o r y f r o m y o u r f a t h e r s whoever they are—what hardships i endured how i lost this handsome palace built for the ages ﬁlled to its depths with hoards of gorgeous things well would to god i’d stayed right here in my own house with a third of all that wealth and they were still alive all who died on the wide plain of troy those years ago far from the stallionland of argos and still much as i weep for all my men grieving sorely time and again sitting here in the royal halls now indulging myself in tears now brushing tears away— the grief that numbs the spirit gluts us quickly— for none of all those comrades pained as i am do i grieve as much for one … that man who makes sleep hateful even food as i pore over his memory no one no achaean labored hard as odysseus labored or achieved so much and how did his struggles end in suffering for that man for me in relentless heartbreaking grief for him lost and gone so long now—dead or alive who knows how they must mourn him too laertes the old man and selfpossessed penelope telemachus as well the boy he left a babe in arms at home” such memories stirred in the young prince a deep desire to grieve for odysseus tears streamed down his cheeks and wet the ground when he heard his father’s name both hands clutching his purple robe before his eyes menelaus recognized him at once but pondered deeply whether to let him state his father’s name or probe him ﬁrst and prompt him step by step while he debated all this now within himself helen emerged from her scented lofty chamber— striking as artemis with her golden shafts— and a train of women followed … adreste drew up her carved recliningchair alcippe brought a carpet of softpiled ﬂeece phylo carried her silver basket given by alcandre king polybus’ wife who made his home in egyptian thebes where the houses overﬂow with the greatest troves of treasure the king gave menelaus a pair of bathingtubs in silver two tripods ten bars of gold and apart from these his wife presented helen her own precious gifts a golden spindle a basket that ran on casters solid silver polished off with rims of gold now phylo her servant rolled it in beside her heaped to the brim with yarn prepared for weaving the spindle swathed in violet wool lay tipped across it helen leaned back in her chair a stool beneath her feet and pressed her husband at once for each detail “do we know my lord menelaus who our visitors claim to be our welcome new arrivals right or wrong what can i say my heart tells me to come right out and say i’ve never seen such a likeness neither in man nor woman—i’m amazed at the sight to the life he’s like the son of great odysseus surely he’s telemachus the boy that hero left a babe in arms at home when all you achaeans fought at troy launching your headlong battles just for my sake shameless whore that i was” “my dear my dear” the redhaired king assured her “now that you mention it i see the likeness too … odysseus’ feet were like the boy’s his hands as well his glancing eyes his head and the ﬁne shock of hair y es and just now as i was talking about odysseus remembering how he struggled suffered all for me a ﬂood of tears came streaming down his face and he clutched his purple robe before his eyes” “right you are”—pisistratus stepped in quickly— “son of atreus king menelaus captain of armies here is the son of that great hero as you say but the man is modest he would be ashamed to make a show of himself his ﬁrst time here and interrupt you we delight in your voice as if some god were speaking the noble horseman nestor sent me along to be his escort telemachus yearned to see you so you could give him some advice or urge some action when a father’s gone his son takes much abuse in a house where no one comes to his defense so with telemachus now his father’s gone no men at home will shield him from the worst” “wonderful” the redhaired king cried out “the son of my dearest friend here in my own house that man who performed a hundred feats of arms for me and i swore that when he came i’d give him a hero’s welcome him above all my comrades—if only olympian zeus farseeing zeus had grante d us both safe passage home across the sea in our swift trim ships why i’d have settled a city in argos for him built him a palace shipped him over from ithaca him and all his wealth his son his people too— emptied one of the cities nestling round about us one i rule myself both fellowcountrymen then how often we’d have mingled sidebyside nothing could have parted us bound by love for each other mutual delight … till death’s dark cloud came shrouding round us both but god himself jealous of all this no doubt robbed that unlucky man him and him alone of the day of his return” so menelaus mused and stirred in them all a deep desire to grieve helen of argos daughter of zeus dissolved in tears telemachus wept too and so did atreus’ son menelaus nor could nestor’s son pisistratus stay dryeyed remembering now his gallant brother antilochus cut down by memnon splendid son of the morning thinking of him the young prince broke out “old nestor always spoke of you son of atreus as the wisest man of all the men he knew whenever we talked about you there at home questioning back and forth so now please if it isn’t out of place indulge me won’t you myself i take no joy in weeping over supper morning will soon bring time enough for that not that i’d grudge a tear for any man gone down to meet his fate what other tribute can we pay to wretched men than to cut a lock let tears roll down our cheeks and i have a brother of my own among the dead and hardly the poorest soldier in our ranks yo u p r o b a b l y k n e w h i m i n e v e r m e t h i m n e v e r saw him myself but they say he outdid our best antilochus—lightning on his feet and every inch a ﬁghter” “well said my friend” the redhaired king replied “not even an older man could speak and do as well yo u r f a t h e r ’s s o n y o u a r e — y o u r w o r d s h a v e a l l h i s w i s d o m it’s easy to spot the breed of a man whom zeus has marked for joy in birth and marriage both take great king nestor now zeus has blessed him all his livelong days growing rich and sleek in his old age at home his sons expert with spears and full of sense well so much for the tears that caught us just now let’s think again of supper come rinse our hands tomorrow at dawn will offer me and telemachus time to talk and trade our thoughts in full” asphalion quickly rinsed their hands with water another of king menelaus’ ready aidesinarms again they reached for the good things set before them then zeus’s daughter helen thought of something else into the mixingbowl from which they drank their wine she slipped a drug heart’sease dissolving anger magic to make us all forget our pains … no one who drank it deeply mulled in wine could let a tear roll down his cheeks that day not even if his mother should die his father die not even if right before his eyes some enemy brought down a brother or darling son with a sharp bronze blade so cunning the drugs that zeus’s daughter plied potent gifts from polydamna the wife of thon a woman of egypt land where the teeming soil bears the richest yield of herbs in all the world many health itself when mixed in the wine and many deadly poison every man is a healer there more skilled than any other men on earth—egyptians born of the healing god himself so now helen once she had drugged the wine and ordered winecups ﬁlled resuming the conversation entertained the group “my royal king menelaus—welcome guests here sons of the great as well zeus can present us times of joy and times of grief in turn all lies within his power so come let’s sit back in the palace now dine and warm our hearts with the old stories i will tell something perfect for the occasion surely i can’t describe or even list them all the exploits crowding fearless odysseus’ record but what a feat that hero dared and carried off in the land of troy where you achaeans suffered scarring his own body with mortifying strokes throwing ﬁlthy rags on his back like any slave he slipped into the enemy’s city roamed its streets— all disguised a totally different man a beggar hardly the ﬁgure he cut among achaea’s ships that’s how odysseus inﬁltrated troy and no one knew him at all … i alone i spotted him for the man he was kept questioning him—the crafty one kept dodging but after i’d bathed him rubbed him down with oil given him clothes to wear and sworn a binding oath not to reveal him as odysseus to the trojans not till he was back at his swift ships and shelters then at last he revealed to me step by step the whole achaean strategy and once he’d cut a troop of trojans down with his long bronze sword back he went to his comrades ﬁlled with information the rest of the trojan women shrilled their grief not i my heart leapt up— my heart had changed by now— i yearned to sail back home again i grieved too late for the madness aphrodite sent me luring me there far from my dear land forsaking my own child my bridal bed my husband too a man who lacked for neither brains nor beauty” and the redhaired menelaus answered helen “there was a tale my lady so well told now then i have studied in my time the plans and minds of great ones by the score and i have traveled over a good part of the world but never once have i laid eyes on a man like him — what a heart that fearless odysseus had inside him what a piece of work the hero dared and carried off in the wooden horse where all our best encamped our champions armed with bloody death for troy … when along you came helen—roused no doubt by a dark power bent on giving troy some glory and dashing prince deiphobus squired your every step three times you sauntered round our hollow ambush feeling stroking its ﬂanks challenging all our ﬁghters calling each by name— yours was the voice of all our longlost wives and diomedes and i crouched tight in the midst with great odysseus hearing you singing out were both keen to spring up and sally forth or give you a sudden answer from inside but odysseus damped our ardor reined us back then all the rest of the troops kept stockstill all but anticlus he was hot to salute you now but odysseus clamped his great hands on the man’s mouth and shut it brutally—yes he saved us all holding on grimset till pallas athena lured you off at last” but clearsighted telemachus ventured “son of atreus king menelaus captain of armies so much the worse for not one bit of that saved him from grisly death … not even a heart of iron could have helped but come send us off to bed it’s time to rest time to enjoy the sweet relief of sleep” and helen briskly told her servingwomen to make beds in the porch’s shelter lay down some heavy purple throws for the beds themselves and over them spread some blankets thick woolly robes a warm covering laid on top torches in hand they left the hall and made up beds at once the herald led the two guests on and so they slept outside the palace under the forecourt’s colonnade young prince telemachus and nestor’s shining son menelaus retired to chambers deep in his lofty house with helen the pearl of women loosely gowned beside him when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more the lord of the warcry climbed from bed and dressed over his shoulder he slung his wellhoned sword fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet stepped from his bedroom handsome as a god and sat beside telemachus asking kindly “now my young prince tell me what brings you here to sunny lacedaemon sailing over the sea’s broad back a public matter or private tell me the truth now” and with all the poise he had telemachus replied “son of atreus king menelaus captain of armies i came in the hope that you can tell me now some news about my father my house is being devoured my rich farms destroyed my palace crammed with enemies slaughtering on and on my droves of sheep and shambling longhorn cattle suitors plague my mother—the insolent overweening … that’s why i’ve come to plead before you now if you can tell me about his cruel death perhaps you saw him die with your own eyes or heard the wanderer’s end from someone else more than all other men that man was born for pain don’t soften a thing from pity respect for me— tell me clearly all your eyes have witnessed i beg you—if ever my father lord odysseus pledged you his word and made it good in action once on the ﬁelds of troy where you achaeans suffered remember his story now tell me the truth” “how shameful” the redhaired king burst out in anger “that’s the bed of a brave man of war they’d like to crawl inside those spineless craven cowards weak as the doe that beds down her fawns in a mighty lion’s den—her newborn sucklings— then trails off to the mountain spurs and grassy bends to graze her ﬁll but back the lion comes to his own lair and the master deals both fawns a ghastly bloody death just what odysseus will deal that mob—ghastly death ah if only—father zeus athena and lord apollo— that man who years ago in the games at lesbos rose to philomelides’ challenge wrestled him pinned him down with one tremendous throw and the argives roared with joy … if only that odysseus sported with those suitors a blood wedding a quick death would take the lot but about the things you’ve asked me so intently i’ll skew and sidestep nothing not deceive you ever of all he told me—the old man of the sea who never lies— i’ll hide or hold back nothing not a single word it was in egypt where the gods still marooned me eager as i was to voyage home … i’d failed you see to render them full ﬂawless victims and gods are always keen to see their rules obeyed now there’s an island out in the ocean’s heavy surge well off the egyptian coast—they call it pharos— far as a deepsea ship can go in one day’s sail with a whistling wind astern to drive her on there’s a snug harbor there good landing beach where crews pull in draw water up from the dark wells then push their vessels off for passage out but here the gods becalmed me twenty days … not a breath of the breezes rufﬂing out to sea that speed a ship across the ocean’s broad back now our rations would all have been consumed our crews’ stamina too if one of the gods had not felt sorry for me shown me mercy eidothea a daughter of proteus that great power the old man of the sea my troubles must have moved her to the heart when she met me trudging by myself without my men they kept roaming around the beach day in day out ﬁshing with twisted hooks their bellies racked by hunger well she came right up to me ﬁlled with questions ‘ are you a fool stranger—soft in the head and lazy too or do you let things slide because you like your pain here you are cooped up on an island far too long with no way out of it none that you can ﬁnd while all your shipmates’ spirit ebbs away’ so she prodded and i replied at once ‘let me tell you goddess—whoever you are— i’m hardly landlocked here of my own free will so i must have angered one of the deathless gods who rule the skies up there but you tell me— you immortals know it all—which one of you blocks my way here keeps me from my voyage how can i cross the swarming sea and reach home at last’ and the glistening goddess reassured me warmly ‘of course my friend i’ll answer all your questions who haunts these parts proteus of egypt does the immortal old man of the sea who never lies who sounds the deep in all its depths poseidon’s servant he’s my father they say he gave me life and he if only you ambush him somehow and pin him down will tell you the way to go the stages of your voyage how you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last and he can tell you too if you want to press him— you are a king it seems— all that’s occurred within your palace good and bad while you’ve been gone your long and painful way’ ‘then you are the one’—i quickly took her up ‘show me the trick to trap this ancient power or he’ll see or sense me ﬁrst and slip away it’s hard for a mortal man to force a god’ ‘true my friend’ the glistening one agreed ‘and again i’ll tell you all you need to know when the sun stands striding at high noon then up from the waves he comes— the old man of the sea who never lies— under a west wind’s gust that shrouds him round in shuddering dark swells and once he’s out on land he heads for his bed of rest in deep hollow caves and around him droves of seals—sleek pups bred by his lovely oceanlady—bed down too in a huddle ﬂopping up from the gray surf giving off the sour reek of the salty ocean depths i’ll lead you there myself at the break of day and couch you all for attack sidebyside choose three men from your crew choose well the best you’ve got aboard the good decked hulls now i will tell you all the old wizard’s tricks … first he will make his rounds and count the seals and once he’s checked their number reviewed them all down in their midst he’ll lie like a shepherd with his ﬂock that’s your moment soon as you see him bedded down muster your heart and strength and hold him fast wildly as he writhes an d ﬁghts you to escape he’ll try all kinds of escape—twist and turn into every beast that moves across the earth transforming himself into water superhuman ﬁre but you hold on for dear life hug him all the harder and when at last he begins to ask you questions— back in the shape you saw him sleep at ﬁrst— relax your grip and set the old god free and ask him outright hero which of the gods is up in arms against you how can you cross the swarming sea and reach home at last’ so she urged and under the breaking surf she dove as i went back to our squadron beached in sand my heart a heaving storm at every step … once i reached my ship hauled up on shore we made our meal and the godsent night came down and then we slept at the sea’s smooth shelving edge when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more i set out down the coast of the wideranging sea praying hard to the gods for all their help taking with me the three men i trusted most on every kind of mission eidothea now had slipped beneath the sea’s engulﬁng folds but back from the waves she came with four sealskins all freshly stripped to deceive her father blind she scooped out lurkingplaces deep in the sand and sat there waiting as we approached her post then couching us sidebyside she ﬂung a sealskin over each man’s back no w there was an ambush that would have overpowered us all—overpowering true the awful reek of all those seafed brutes who’d dream of bedding down with a monster of the deep but the goddess sped to our rescue found the cure with ambrosia daubing it under each man’s nose— that lovely scent it drowned the creatures’ stench so all morning we lay there waiting spirits steeled while seals came crowding jostling out of the sea and ﬂopped down in rows basking along the surf at high noon the old man emerged from the waves and found his fatfed seals and made his rounds counting them off counting us the ﬁrst four but he had no inkling of all the fraud afoot then down he lay and slept but we with a battlecry we rushed him ﬂung our arms around him—he’d lost nothing the old rascal none of his cunning quick techniques first he shifted into a great bearded lion and then a serpent— a panther— a ramping wild boar— a torrent of water— a tree with soaring branchtops— but we held on for dear life braving it out until at last that quickchange artist the old wizard began to weary of all this and burst out into rapidﬁre questions ‘which god menelaus conspired with you to trap me in ambush seize me against my will what on earth do you want’ ‘y ou know old man’ i countered now ‘why put me off with questions here i am cooped up on an island far too long with no way out of it none that i can ﬁnd while my spirit ebbs away but you tell me— you immortals know it all—which one of you blocks my way here keeps me from my voyage how can i cross the swarming sea and reach home at last’ ‘how wrong you were’ the seer shot back at once ‘y ou should have offered zeus and the other gods a handsome sacriﬁce then embarked if you ever hoped for a rapid journey home across the winedark sea it’s not your destiny yet to see your loved ones reach your own grand house your native land at last not till you sail back through egyptian waters— the great nile swelled by the rains of zeus— and make a splendid rite to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies then only then will the gods grant you the voyage you desire’ so he urged and broke the heart inside me having to double back on the mistbound seas back to egypt that that long and painful way … nevertheless i caught my breath and answered ‘that i will do old man as you command but tell me this as well and leave out nothing did all the achaeans reach home in the ships unharmed all we left behind nestor and i en route from troy or did any die some cruel death by shipwreck or die in the arms of loved ones once they’d wound down the long coil of war’ and he lost no time in saying ‘son of atreus why do you ask me that why do you need to know why probe my mind y ou won’t stay dryeyed long i warn you once you have heard the whole story many of them were killed many survived as well but only two who captained your bronzearmored units died on the way home—you know who died in the ﬁghting you were there yourself and one is still alive held captive somewhere off in the endless seas … ajax now went down with his longoared ﬂeet first poseidon drove him onto the cliffs of gyrae looming cliffs then saved him from the breakers— he’d have escaped his doom too despite athena’s hate if he hadn’t ﬂung that brazen boast the mad blind fool “in the teeth of the gods” he bragged “i have escaped the ocean’s sheer abyss” poseidon heard that frantic vaunt and the god grasped his trident in both his massive hands and struck the gyraean headland hacked the rock in two and the giant stump stood fast but the jagged spur where ajax perched at ﬁrst the raving madman— toppling into the sea it plunged him down down in the vast seething depths and so he died having drunk his ﬁll of brine yo u r b r o t h e r he somehow escaped that fate agamemnon got away in his beaked ships queen hera pulled him through but just as he came abreast of malea’s beetling cape a hurricane snatched him up and swept him way off course— groaning desperate—driving him over the ﬁshinfested sea to the wild borderland where thyestes made his home in days of old and his son aegisthus lived now but even from there a safe return seemed likely yes the immortals swung the wind around to fair and the victors sailed home how he rejoiced atrides setting foot on his fatherland once rnore— he took that native earth in his hands and kissed it hot tears ﬂooding his eyes so thrilled to see his land but a watchman saw him too—from a lookout high above— a spy that cunning aegisthus stationed there luring the man with two gold bars in payment one whole year he’d watched … so the great king would not get past unseen his ﬁghting power intact for selfdefense the spy ran the news to his master’s halls and aegisthus quickly set his stealthy trap picking the twenty best recruits from town he packed them in ambush at one end of the house at the other he ordered a banquet dressed and spread and went to welcome the conquering hero agamemnon went with team and chariot and a mind aswarm with evil up from the shore he led the king he ushered him in— suspecting nothing of all his doom—he feasted him well then cut him down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough not one of your brother’s menatarms was left alive none of aegisthus’ either all killed in the palace’ so proteus said and his story crushed my heart i knelt down in the sand and wept i’d no desire to go on living and see the rising light of day but once i’d had my ﬁll of tears and writhing there the old man of the sea who never lies continued ‘no more now menelaus how long must you weep withering tears what g ood can come of tears none i know of strive instead to return to your native country—hurry home at once either you’ll ﬁnd the murderer still alive or orestes will have beaten you to the kill yo u ’ l l b e i n t i m e t o s h a r e t h e f u n e r a l f e a s t ’ so he pressed and i felt my heart my old pride for all my grieving glow once more in my chest and i asked the seer in a rush of winging words ‘those two i know now tell me the third man’s name who is still alive held captive off in the endless seas unless he’s dead by now i want to know the truth though it grieves me all the more’ ‘odysseus’— the old prophet named the third at once— ‘laertes’ son who makes his home in ithaca … i saw him once on an island weeping live warm tears in the nymph calypso’s house—she holds him there by force he has no way to voyage home to his own native land no trim ships in reach no crew to ply the oars and send him scudding over the sea’s broad back but about your destiny menelaus dear to zeus it’s not for you to die and meet your fate in the stallionland of argos no the deathless ones will sweep you off to the world’s end the elysian fields where gold haired rhadamanthys waits where life glides on in immortal ease for mortal man no snow no winter onslaught never a downpour there but night and day the ocean river sends up breezes singing winds of the west refreshing all mankind all this because you are helen’s husband now— the gods count you the soninlaw of zeus’ so he divined and down the breaking surf he dove as i went back to the sh ips with my brave men my heart a rising tide at every step once i reached my craft hauled up on shore we made our meal and the godsent night came down and then we slept at the sea’s smooth shelving edge when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more we hauled the vessels down to the sunlit breakers ﬁrst then stepped the masts amidships canvas brailed— the crews swung aboard they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke back we went to the nile swelled by the rains of zeus i moored the ships and sacriﬁced in a splendid rite and once i’d slaked the wrath of the everlasting gods i raised a mound for agamemnon his undying glory all this done i set sail and the gods sent me a stiff following wind that sped me home home to the native land i love but come my boy stay on in my palace now with me at least till ten or a dozen days have passed then i’ll give you a princely sendoff—shining gifts three stallions and a chariot burnished bright— and i’ll add a gorgeous cup so you can pour libations out to the deathless gods on high and remember menelaus all your days” telemachus summoning up his newfound tact replied “please menelaus don’t keep me quite so long true i’d gladly sit beside you one whole year without a twinge of longing for home or parents it’s wonderful how you tell your stories all you say— i delight to listen y es but now i’m afraid my comrades must be restless in sacred pylos and here you’d hold me just a little longer as for the gift you give me let it be a keepsake those horses i really cannot take to ithaca better to leave them here to be your glory yo u r u l e a w i d e l e v e l p l a i n where the ﬁelds of clover roll and galingale and wheat and oats and glistening fullgrain barley no runningroom for mares in ithaca though no meadows goat not stallion land yet it means the world to me none of the rugged islands slanting down to sea is good for pasture or good for bridle paths but ithaca best of isla nds crowns them all” so he declared the lord of the warcry smiled patted him with his hand and praised his guest concluding “good blood runs in you dear boy your words are proof certainly i’ll exchange the gifts the power’s mine of all the treasures lying heaped in my palace you shall have the ﬁnest most esteemed why i’ll give you a mixingbowl forged to perfection— it’s solid silver ﬁnished off with a lip of gold hephaestus made it himself and a royal friend phaedimus king of sidon lavished it on me when his palace welcomed me on passage home how pleased i’d be if you took it as a gift” and now as the two conﬁded in each other banqueters arrived at the great king’s palace leading their own sheep bearing their hearty wine and their wives in lovely headbands sent along the food and so they bustled about the halls preparing dinner … but all the while the suitors before odysseus’ palace amused themselves with discus and long throwing spears out on the leveled grounds free and easy as always full of swagger but lord antinous sat apart dashing eurymachus beside him ringleaders head and shoulders the strongest of the lot phronius’ son noëmon approached them now quick to press antinous with a question “a n t i n o u s h a v e w e a n y n o t i o n o r n o t when telemachus will return from sandy pylos he sailed in a ship of mine and now i need her back to cross over to elis plain where i keep a dozen horses broodmares suckling some heavyduty mules unbroken i’d like to drive one home and break him in” that dumbfounded them both they never dreamed the prince had gone to pylos neleus’ city— certain the boy was still nearby somewhere out on his farm with ﬂock s or with the swineherd “tell me the truth” antinous wheeled on noëmon “when did he go and what young crew went with him ithaca’s best or his own slaves and servants surely he has enough to man a ship tell me this—be clear—i’ve got to know did he commandeer your ship against your will or did you volunteer it once he’d won you over” “i volunteered it of course” noëmon said “what else could anyone do when such a man a prince weighed down with troubles asked a favor hard to deny him anything and the young crew that formed his escort well they’re the ﬁnest men on the island next to us and mentor took command—i saw him climb aboard— or a god who looked like mentor head to foot and that’s what i ﬁnd strange i saw good mentor yesterday just at sunup here but clearly he boarded ship for pylos days ago” with that he headed back to his father’s house leaving the two lords stiff with indignation they made the suitors sit down in a group and stop their games at once eupithes’ son antinous rose up in their midst to speak his dark heart ﬁlled with fury blazing with anger—eyes like searing ﬁre “by god what a ﬁne piece of work he’s carried off telemachus—what insolence—and we thought his little jaunt would come to grief but in spite of us all look the young cub slips away just like that — picks the best crew in the land and off he sails and this is just the start of the trouble he can make zeus kill that brazen boy before he hits his prime quick fetch me a swift ship and twenty men— i’ll waylay him from ambush board him coming back in the straits between ithaca and rocky same this gallant voyage of his to ﬁnd his father will ﬁnd him wrecked at last” they all roared approval urged him on rose at once and retired to odysseus’ palace but not for long was penelope unaware of the grim plots her suitors planned in secret the herald medon told her he’d overheard their schemes listening in outside the court while they wove on within he rushed the news through the halls to tell the queen who greeted him as he crossed her chamber’s threshold “herald why have the young blades sent you now to order king odysseus’ servingwomen to stop their work and slave to ﬁx their feast i hate their courting their running riot here— would to god that this meal here and now were their last meal on earth day after day all of you swarming draining our life’s blood my wary son’s estate what didn’t you listen to your fathers—when you were children years ago— telling you how odysseus treated them your parents never an unfair word never an unfair action among his people here though that’s the way of our godappointed kings hating one man loving the next with luck not odysseus never an outrage done to any man alive but you you and your ugly outbursts shameful acts they’re plain to see look at the thanks he gets for all past acts of kindness” medon replied sure of his own discretion “ ah my queen if only that were the worst of all you face now your suitors are plotting something worse harsher cruder god forbid they bring it off they’re poised to cut telemachus down with bronze swords on his way back home he’s sailed off you see … for news of his father—to sacred pylos ﬁrst then out to the sunny hills of lacedaemon” her knees gave way on the spot her heart too she stood there speechless a while struck dumb tears ﬁlling her eyes her warm voice choked at last she found some words to make reply “oh herald why has my child gone and left me no need in the world for him to board the ships those chariots of the sea that sweep men on driving across the ocean’s endless wastes … does he want his very name wiped off the earth” medon the soul of thoughtfulness responded “i don’t know if a god inspired your son or the boy’s own impulse led him down to pylos but he went to learn of his father’s journey home or whatever fate he’s met” back through king odysseus’ house he went but a cloud of heartbreak overwhelmed the queen she could bear no longer sitting on a chair though her room had chairs aplenty down she sank on her wellbuilt chamber’s ﬂoor weeping pitifully as the women whimpered round her all the women young and old who served her house penelope sobbing uncontrollably cried out to them “hear me dear ones zeus has given me torment— me above all the others born and bred in my day my lionhearted husband lost long years ago who excelled the argives all in every strength— that great man whose fame resounds through hellas right to the depths of argos but now my son my darling boy—the whirlwinds have ripped him out of the halls without a trace i never heard he’d gone—not even from you you hard heartless … not one of you even thought to rouse me from my bed though well you knew when he boarded that black ship oh if only i had learned he was planning such a journey he would have stayed by god keen as he was to sail— or left me dead right here within our palace go someone quickly call old dolius now the servant my father gave me when i came the man who tends my orchard green with trees so he can run to laertes sit beside him tell him the whole story blowbyblow perhaps—who knows—he’ll weave some plan he’ll come out of hiding plead with all these people mad to destroy his line his son’s line of kings” “oh dear girl” eurycleia the fond old nurse replied “kill me then with a bronze knife—no mercy—or let me live here in the palace—i’ll hide nothing from you now i knew it all i gave him all he asked for bread and mellow wine but he made me take a mighty oath that i i wouldn’t tell you no not till ten or a dozen days had passed or you missed the lad yourself and learned he’d gone so tears would never mar your lovely face … come bathe now put some fresh clothes on climb to the upper rooms with all your women and pray to pallas daughter of storming zeus— she may save telemachus yet even at death’s door don’t worry an old man worried enough by now i can’t believe the blessed gods so hate the heirs of king arcesius through and through one will still live on—i know it—born to rule this lofty house and the green ﬁelds far and wide” with that she lulled penelope’s grief and dried her eyes of tears and the queen bathed and put fresh clothing on climbed to the upper rooms with all her women and sifting barley into a basket prayed to pallas “hear me daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder— tireless one athena if ever here in his halls resourceful king odysseus burned rich thighs of sheep or oxen in your honor oh remember it now for my sake save my darling son defend him from these outrageous overbearing suitors” she shrilled a high cry and the goddess heard her prayer as the suitors burst into uproar through the shadowed halls and one of the lusty young men began to brag “listen our longcourted queen’s preparing us all a marriage— with no glimmer at all how the murder of her son has been decreed” boasting so with no glimmer at all of what had been decreed but antinous took the ﬂoor and issued orders “stupid fools muzzle your bragging now— before someone slips inside and reports us up now not a sound drive home our plan— it suits us well we approved it one and all” with that he picked out twenty ﬁrstrate men and down they went to the swift ship at the sea’s edge first they hauled the craft into deeper water stepped the mast amidships canvas brailed made oars fast in the leather oarlock straps while zealous aidesinarms brought weapons on they moored her well out in the channel disembarked and took their meal on shore waiting for dusk to fall but there in her upper rooms she lay penelope lost in thought fasting shunning food and drink brooding now … would her ﬁne son escape his death or go down at her overweening suitors’ hands her mind in torment wheeling like some lion at bay dreading gangs of hunters closing their cunning ring around him for the ﬁnish harried so she was when a deep kind sleep overcame her back she sank and slept her limbs fell limp and still and again the brighteyed goddess pallas thought of one more way to help she made a phantom now its build like a woman’s build iphthime’s yes another daughter of generous lord icarius eumelus’ bride who made her home in pherae athena sped her on to king odysseus’ house to spare penelope worn with pain and sobbing further spells of grief and storms of tears the phantom entered her bedroom passing quickly in through the doorbolt slit and hovering at her head she rose and spoke now “sleeping penelope your heart so wrung with sorrow no need i tell you no the gods who live at ease can’t bear to let you weep and rack your spirit yo u r s o n w i l l s t i l l c o m e h o m e — i t i s d e c r e e d he’s never wronged the gods in any way” and penelope murmured back still cautious drifting softly now at the gate of dreams “why have you come my sister yo u r v i s i t s a l l t o o r a r e i n t h e p a s t for you make your home so very far away yo u t e l l m e t o l a y t o r e s t t h e g r i e f a n d t e a r s that overwhelm me now torment me heart and soul with my lionhearted husband lost long years ago who excelled the argives all in every strength that great man whose fame resounds through hellas right to the depths of argos … and now my darling boy he’s off and gone in a hollow ship just a youngster still untrained for war or stiff debate him i mourn him even more than i do my husband— quake in terror for all that he might suffer either on open sea or shores he goes to visit hordes of enemies scheme against him now keen to kill him off before he can reach his native land again” “courage” the shadowy phantom reassured her “don’t be overwhelmed by all your direst fears he travels with such an escort one that others would pray to stand beside them she has power— pallas athena she pities you in your tears she wings me here to tell you all these things” but the circumspect penelope replied “if you are a god and have heard a god’s own voice come tell me about that luckless man as well is he still alive does he see the light of day or is he dead already lost in the house of death” “a b o u t t h a t m a n ” t h e s h a d o w y p h a n t o m a n s w e r e d “i cannot tell you the story start to ﬁnish whether he’s dead or alive it’s wrong to lead you on with idle words” at that she glided off by the doorpost past the bolt— gone on a lifting breeze icarius’ daughter started up from sleep her spirit warmed now that a dream so clear had come to her in darkest night but the suitors boarded now and sailed the sealanes plotting in their hearts telemachus’ plunge to death off in the middle channel lies a rocky island just between ithaca and same’s rugged cliffs— asteris—not large but it has a cove a harbor with two mouths where ships can hide here the achaeans lurked in ambush for the prince book v odysseus—nymph and shipwreck as dawn rose up from bed by her lordly mate tithonus bringing light to immortal gods and mortal men the gods sat down in council circling zeus the thunder king whose power rules the world athena began recalling odysseus to their thoughts the goddess deeply moved by the man’s long ordeal held captive still in the nymph calypso’s house “father zeus—you other happy gods who never die— never let any sceptered king be kind and gentle now not with all his heart or set his mind on justice— no let him be cruel and always practice outrage think not one of the people whom he ruled remembers odysseus now that godlike man and kindly as a father to his children now he’s left to pine on an island racked with grief in the nymph calypso’s house—she holds him there by force he has no way to voyage home to his own native land no trim ships in reach no crew to ply the oars and send him scudding over the sea’s broad back and now his dear son … they plot to kill the boy on his way back home y es he has sailed off for news of his father to holy pylos ﬁrst then out to the sunny hills of lacedaemon” “my child” zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied “what nonsense you let slip through your teeth come now wasn’t the plan your own y ou conceived it yourself odysseus shall return and pay the traitors back telemachus sail him home with all your skill— the power is yours no doubt— home to his native country all unharmed while the suitors limp to port defeated bafﬂed men” with those words zeus turned to his own son hermes “y ou are our messenger hermes sent on all our missions announce to the nymph with lovely braids our ﬁxed decree odysseus journeys home—the exile must return but not in the convoy of the gods or mortal men no on a lashed makeshift raft and wrung with pains on the twentieth day he will make his landfall fertile scheria the land of phaeacians close kin to the gods themselves who with all their hearts will prize him like a god and send him off in a ship to his own beloved land giving him bronze and hoards of gold and robes— more plunder than he could ever have won from troy if odysseus had returned intact with his fair share so his destiny ordains he shall see his loved ones reach his highroofed house his native land at last” so zeus decreed and the giantkilling guide obeyed at once quickly under his feet he fastened the supple sandals everglowing gold that wing him over the waves and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds he seized the wand that enchants the eyes of men whenever hermes wants or wakes us up from sleep that wand in his grip the powerful giantkiller swooping down from pieria down the high clear air plunged to the sea and skimmed the waves like a tern that down the deadly gulfs of the barren salt swells glides and dives for ﬁsh dipping its beating wings in bursts of spray— so hermes skimmed the crests on endless crests but once he gained that island worlds apart up from the deepblue sea he climbed to dry land and strode on till he reached the spacious cave where the nymph with lovely braids had made her home and he found her there inside … a great ﬁre blazed on the hearth and the smell of cedar cleanly split and sweetwood burning bright wafted a cloud of fragrance down the island deep inside she sang the goddess calypso lifting her breathtaking voice as she glided back and forth before her loom her golden shuttle weaving thick luxuriant woods grew round the cave alders and black poplars pungent cypress too and there birds roosted folding their long wings owls and hawks and the spreadbeaked ravens of the sea black skimmers who make their living off the waves and round the mouth of the cavern trailed a vine laden with clusters bursting with ripe grapes four springs in a row bubbling clear and cold running sidebyside took channels left and right soft meadows spreading round were starred with violets lush with beds of parsley why even a deathless god who came upon that place would gaze in wonder heart entranced with pleasure hermes the guide the mighty giantkiller stood there spellbound … but once he’d had his ﬁll of marveling at it all he briskly entered the deep vaulted cavern calypso lustrous goddess knew him at once as soon as she saw his features facetoface immortals are never strangers to each other no matter how distant one may make her home but as for great odysseus— hermes could not ﬁnd him within the cave off he sat on a headland weeping there as always wrenching his heart with sobs and groans and anguish gazing out over the barren sea through blinding tears but calypso lustrous goddess questioned hermes seating him on a glistening polished chair “god of the golden wand why have you come a beloved honored friend but it’s been so long your visits much too rare tell me what’s on your mind i’m eager to do it whatever i can do … whatever can be done” and the goddess drew a table up beside him heaped with ambrosia mixed him deepred nectar hermes the guide and giantkiller ate and drank once he had dined and fortiﬁed himself with food he launched right in replying to her questions “a s o n e g o d t o a n o t h e r y o u a s k m e w h y i ’ v e c o m e i’ll tell you the whole story mince no words— your wish is my command it was zeus who made me come no choice of mine who would willingly roam across a salty waste so vast so endless think no city of men in sight and not a soul to offer the gods a sacriﬁce and burn the fattest victims but there is no way you know for another god to thwart the will of storming zeus and make it come to nothing zeus claims you keep beside you a most unlucky man most harried of all who fought for priam’s troy nine years sacking the city in the tenth and then set sail for home but voyaging back they outraged queen athena who loosed the gales and po unding seas against them there all the rest of his loyal shipmates died but the wind drove him on the current bore him here now zeus commands you to send him off with all good speed it is not his fate to die here far from his own people destiny still ordains that he shall see his loved ones reach his highroofed house his native land at last” but lustrous calypso shuddered at those words and burst into a ﬂight of indignation “hardhearted you are you gods y ou unrivaled lords of jealousy— scandalized when goddesses sleep with mortals openly even when one has made the man her husband so when dawn with her rosered ﬁngers took orion you gods in your everlasting ease were horriﬁed till chaste artemis throned in gold attacked him out on delos shot him to death with gentle shafts and so when demeter the graceful one with lovely braids gave way to her passion and made love with iasion bedding down in a furrow plowed three times— zeus got wind of it soon enough i’d say and blasted the man to death with ﬂashing bolts so now at last you gods you train your spite on me for keeping a mortal man beside me the man i saved riding astride his keelboard all alone when zeus with one hurl of a whitehot bolt had crushed his racing warship down the winedark sea there all the rest of his loyal shipmates died but the wind drove him on the current bore him here and i welcomed him warmly cherished him even vowed to make the man immortal ageless all his days … but since there is no way for another god to thwart the will of storming zeus and make it come to nothing let the man go—if the almi ghty insists commands— and destroy himself on the barren salt sea i’ll send him off but not with any escort i have no ships in reach no crew to ply the oars and send him scudding over the sea’s broad back but i will gladly advise him—i’ll hide nothing— so he can reach his native country all unharmed” and the guide and giantkiller reinforced her words “release him at once just so steer clear of the rage of zeus or down the years he’ll fume and make your life a hell” with that the powerful giantkiller sped away the queenly nymph sought out the great odysseus— the commands of zeus still ringing in her ears— and found him there on the headland sitting still weeping his eyes never dry his sweet life ﬂowing away with the tears he wept for his foiled journey home since the nymph no longer pleased in the nights true he’d sleep with her in the arching cave—he had no choice— unwilling lover alongside lover all too willing … but all his days he’d sit on the rocks and beaches wrenching his heart with sobs and groans and anguish gazing out over the barren sea through blinding tears so coming up to him now the lustrous goddess ventured “no need my unlucky one to grieve here any longer no don’t waste your life away now i am willing heart and soul to send you off at last come take bronze tools cut your lengthy timbers make them into a broadbeamed raft and top it off with a halfdeck high enough to sweep you free and clear on the misty seas and i myself will stock her with food and water ruddy wine to your taste—all to stave off hunger— give you clothing send you a stiff following wind so you can reach your native country all unharmed if only the gods are willing they rule the vaulting skies they’re stronger than i to plan and drive things home” longenduring odysseus shuddered at that and broke out in a sharp ﬂight of protest “passage home never surely you’re plotting something else goddess urging me—in a raft— to cross the ocean’s mighty gulfs so vast so full of danger not even deepsea ships can make it through swift as they are and buoyed up by the winds of zeus himself i won’t set foot on a raft until you show good faith until you consent to swear goddess a binding oath you’ll never plot some new intrigue to harm me” he was so intense the lustrous goddess smiled stroked him with her hand savored his name arid chided “ ah what a wicked man you are and never at a loss what a thing to imagine what a thing to say earth be my witness now the vaulting sky above and the dark cascading waters of the styx—i swear by the greatest grimmest oath that binds the happy gods i will never plot some new intrigue to harm you never all i have in mind and devise for you are the very plans i’d fashion for myself if i were in your straits my every impulse bends to what is right not iron trust me the heart within my breast i am all compassion” and lustrous calypso quickly led the way as he followed in the footsteps of the goddess they reached the arching cavern man and god as one and odysseus took the seat that hermes just left while the nymph set out before him every kind of food and drink that mortal men will take calypso sat down facetoface with the king and the women served her nectar and ambrosia they reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they’d had their ﬁll of food and drink the lustrous one took up a new approach “so then royal son of laertes odysseus man of exploits still eager to leave at once and hurry back to your own home your beloved native land good luck to you even so farewell but if you only knew down deep what pains are fated to ﬁll your cup before you reach that shore you’d stay right here preside in our house with me and be immortal much as you long to see your wife the one you pine for all your days … and yet i just might claim to be nothing less than she neither in face nor ﬁgure hardly right is it for mortal woman to rival immortal goddess how in build in beauty” “a h g r e a t g o d d e s s ” worldly odysseus answered “don’t be angry with me please all that you say is true how well i know look at my wise penelope she falls far short of you your beauty stature she is mortal after all and you you never age or die … nevertheless i long—i pine all my days— to travel home and see the dawn of my return and if a god will wreck me yet again on the winedark sea i can bear that too with a spirit tempered to endure much have i suffered labored long and hard by now in the waves and wars add this to the total— bring the trial on” even as he spoke the sun set and the darkness swept the earth and now withdrawing into the cavern’s deep recesses long in each other’s arms they lost themselves in love when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more odysseus quickly dressed himself in cloak and shirt while the nymph slipped on a loose glistening robe ﬁlmy a joy to the eye and round her waist she ran a brocaded golden belt and over her head a scarf to shield her brow then turned to plan the great man’s voyage home she gave him a heavy bronze ax that ﬁt his grip both blades wellhoned with a ﬁne olive haft lashed ﬁrm to its head she gave him a polished smoothingadze as well and then she led the way to the island’s outer edge where trees grew tall alders black poplars and ﬁrs that shot skyhigh seasoned drying for years ideal for easy ﬂoating once she’d shown her guest where the tall timber stood calypso the lustrous goddess headed home again he set to cutting trunks—the work was done in no time twenty in all he felled he trimmed them clean with his ax and split them deftly trued them straight to the line meanwhile the radiant goddess brought him drills— he bored through all his planks and wedged them snugly knocking them home together locked with pegs and bolts broad in the beam and bottom ﬂat as a merchantman when a master shipwright turns out her hull so broad the craft odysseus made himself working away at speed he put up halfdecks pinned to closeset ribs and a sweep of gunwales rounded off the sides he fashioned the mast next and sank its yard in deep and added a steeringoar to hold her right on course then he fenced her stem to stern with twigs and wicker bulwark against the seasurge ﬂoored with heaps of brush and lustrous calypso came again now with bolts of cloth to make the sail and he ﬁnished that off too expertly braces sheets and brails—he rigged all fast on board then eased her down with levers into the sunlit sea that was the fourth day and all his work was done on the ﬁfth the lovely goddess launched him from her island once she had bathed and decked him out in fragrant clothes and calypso stowed two skins aboard—dark wine in one the larger one held water—added a sack of rations ﬁlled with her choicest meats to build his strength and summoned a wind to bear him onward fair and warm the wind lifting his spirits high royal odysseus spread sail—gripping the tiller seated astern— and now the master mariner steered his craft sleep never closing his eyes forever scanning the stars the pleiades and the plowman late to set and the great bear that mankind also calls the wagon she wheels on her axis always ﬁxed watching the hunter and she alone is denied a pl unge in the ocean’s baths hers were the stars the lustrous goddess told him to keep hard to port as he cut across the sea and seventeen days he sailed making headway well on the eighteenth shadowy mountains slowly loomed … the phaeacians’ island reaching toward him now over the misty breakers rising like a shield but now poseidon god of the earthquake saw him— just returning home from his ethiopian friends from miles away on the solymi mountainrange he spied odysseus sailing down the sea and it made his fury boil even more he shook his head and rumbled to himself “outrageous look how the go ds have changed their minds about odysseus—while i was off with my ethiopians just look at him there nearing phaeacia’s shores where he’s fated to escape his noose of pain that’s held him until now still my hopes ride high— i’ll give that man his swamping ﬁll of trouble” with that he rammed the clouds together—both hands clutching his trident—churned the waves into chaos whipping all the gales from every quarter shrouding over in thunderheads the earth and sea at once—and ni ght swept down from the sky— east and south winds clashed an d the raging west and north sprung from the heavens roiled heaving breakers up— and odysseus’ knees quaked his spirit too numb with fear he spoke to his own great heart “wretched man—what becomes of me now at last i fear the nymph foretold it all too well— on the high seas she said before i can reach my native land i’ll ﬁll my cup of pain and now look it all comes to pass what monstrous clouds— king zeus crowning the whole wide heaven black— churning the seas in chaos gales blasting raging around my head from every quarter— my deathplunge in a ﬂash it’s certain now three four times blessed my friendsinarms who died on the plains of troy those years ago serving the sons of atreus to the end would to god i’d died there too and met my fate that day the trojans swarms of them hurled at me with bronze spears ﬁghting over the corpse of proud achilles a hero’s funeral then my glory spread by comrades— now what a wretched death i’m doomed to die” at that a massive wave came crashing down on his head a terriﬁc onslaught spinning his craft round and round— he was thrown clear of the decks— the steeringoar wrenched from his grasp— and in one lightning attack the brawling galewinds struck fullforce snapping the mast midshaft and hurling the sail and sailyard far across the sea he went under a good long while no fast way out no struggling up from under the giant wave’s assault his clothing dragged him down—divine calypso’s gifts— but at last he fought his way to the surface spewing bitter brine streams of it pouring down his head but halfdrowned as he was he’d not forget his craft— he lunged after her through the breakers laying hold and huddling amidships ﬂed the stroke of death pellmell the rollers tossed her along downcurrent wild as the north wind tossing thistle along the ﬁelds at high harvest—dry stalks clutching each other tightly— so the galewinds tumbled her down the sea this way that way now the south wind ﬂinging her over to north to sport with now the east wind giving her up to west to harry on and on but someone saw him—cadmus’ daughter with lovely ankles ino a mortal woman once with human voice and called leucothea now she lives in the sea’s salt depths esteemed by all the gods as she deserves she pitied odysseus tossed tormented so— she broke from the waves like a shearwater on the wing lit on the wreck and asked him kindly “ ah poor man why is the god of earthquakes so dead set against you strewing your way with such a crop of troubles but he can’t destroy you not for all his anger just do as i say y ou seem no fool to me strip off those clothes and leave your craft for the winds to hurl and swim for it now you must strike out with your arms for landfall there phaeacian land where destined safety waits here take this scarf tie it around your waist—it is immortal nothing to fear now neither pain nor death but once you grasp the mainland with your hands untie it quickly throw it into the winedark sea far from the shore but you you turn your head away” with that the goddess handed him the scarf and slipped back in the heavy breaking seas like a shearwater once again— and a dark heaving billow closed above her but battleweary odysseus weighed two courses deeply torn probing his ﬁghting spirit “oh no— i fear another immortal weaves a snare to trap me urging me to abandon ship i won’t not yet that shore’s too far away— i glimpsed it myself—where she says refuge waits no here’s what i’ll do it’s what seems best to me as long as the timbers cling and joints stand fast i’ll hold out aboard her and take a whipping— once the breakers smas h my craft to pieces then i’ll swim—no better plan for now” but just as great odysseus thrashed things out poseidon god of the earthquake launched a colossal wave terrible murderous arching over him pounding down on him hard as a windstorm blasting piles of dry parched chaff scattering ﬂying husks—so th e long planks of his boat were scattered far and wide but odysseus leapt aboard one timber and riding it like a plunging racehorse stripped away his clothes divine calypso’s gifts and quickly tying the scarf around his waist he dove headﬁrst in the sea stretched his arms and stroked for life itself but again the mighty god of earthquakes spied him shook his head and grumbled deep in his spirit “go go after all you’ve suffered—rove your miles of sea— till you fall in the arms of people loved by zeus even so i can hardly think you’ll ﬁnd your punishments too light” with that threat he lashed his team with their long ﬂowing manes gaining aegae port where his famous palace stands but zeus’s daughter athena countered him at once the rest of the winds she st opped right in their tracks commanding them all to hush now go to sleep all but the boisterous north—she whipped him up and the goddess beat the breakers ﬂat before odysseus dear to zeus so he could reach the phaeacians mingle with men who love their long oars and escape his death at last ye s b u t n o w adrift on the heaving swells two nights two days— quite lost—again and again the man foresaw his death then when dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day the wind fell in an instant all glazed to a dead calm and odysseus scanning sharply raised high by a groundswell looked up and saw it—landfall just ahead joy … warm as the joy that children feel when they see their fath er’s life dawn again one who’s lain on a sickbed racked with torment wasting away slowly under some angry power’s onslaught— then what joy when the gods deliver him from his pains so warm odysseus’ joy when he saw that shore those trees as he swam on anxious to plant his feet on solid ground again but just offshore as far as a man’s shout can carry he caught the boom of a heavy surf on jagged reefs— roaring breakers crashing down on an ironbound coast exploding in fury— the whole sea shrouded— sheets of spray— no harbors to hold ships no roadstead where they’d ride nothing but jutting headlands riptooth reefs cliffs odysseus’ knees quaked and the heart inside him sank he spoke to his ﬁghting spirit desperate “worse and worse now that zeus has granted a gli mpse of land beyond my hopes now i’ve crossed this waste of water the end in sight there’s no way out of the boiling surf—i see no way rugged reefs offshore around them breakers roaring above them a smooth rock face rising steeply look and the surge too deep inshore no spot to stand on my own two legs and battle free of death if i clamber out some big comber will hoist me dash me against that cliff—my struggles all a waste if i keep on swimming down the coast trying to ﬁnd a seabeach shelving against the waves a sheltered cove— i dread it—another gale will snatch me up and haul me back to the ﬁshinfested sea retching in despair or a dark power will loose some monster at me rearing out of the waves—one of the thousands amphitrite’s breakers teem with well i know the famous god of earthqua kes hates my very name” just as that fear went churning through his mind a tremendous roller swept him toward the rocky coast where he’d have been ﬂayed alive his bones crushed if the brighteyed goddess pallas had not inspired him now he lunged for a reef he seized it with both hands and clung for dear life groaning until the giant wave surged past and so he escaped its force but the breaker’s backwash charged into him full fury and hurled him out to sea like pebbles stuck in the suckers of some octopus dragged from its lair—so strips of skin torn from his clawing hands stuck to the rock face a heavy sea covered him over then and there unlucky odysseus would have met his death— against the will of fate— but the brighteyed one inspired him yet again fighting out from the breakers pounding toward the coast out of danger he swam on sca nning the land trying to ﬁnd a seabeach shelving against the waves a sheltered cove and stroking hard he came abreast of a river’s mouth running calmly the perfect spot he thought … free of rocks with a windbreak from the gales as the current ﬂowed he felt the river’s god and prayed to him in spirit “hear me lord whoever you are i’ve come to you the answer to all my prayers— rescue me from the sea the sealord’s curse even immortal gods will show a man respect whatever wanderer seeks their help—like me— i throw myself on your mercy on your current now— i have suffered greatly pity me lord your suppliant cries for help” so the man prayed and the god stemmed his current held his surge at once and smoothing out the swells before odysseus now drew him safe to shore at the river’s mouth his knees buckled massive arms fell limp the sea had beaten down his striving heart his whole body swollen brine aplenty gushing out of his mouth and nostrils—breathless speechless there he lay with only a little strength left in him deathly waves of exhaustion overwhelmed him now … but once he regained his breath and rallied back to life at last he loosed the goddess’ scarf from his body dropped it into the river ﬂowing out to sea and a swift current bore it far downstream and suddenly ino caught it in her hands struggling up from the banks he ﬂung himself in the deep reeds he kissed the good green earth and addressed his ﬁghting spirit desperate still “man of misery what next is this the end if i wait out a long tense night by the banks i fear the sharp frost and the soaking dew together will do me in—i’m boneweary about to breathe my last and a cold wind blows from a river on toward morning but what if i climb that slope go for the dark woods and bed down in the thick brush what if i’m spared the chill fatigue and a sweet sleep comes my way i fear wild beasts will drag me off as quarry” but this was the better course it struck him now he set out for the woods and not far from the water found a grove with a clearing all around and crawled beneath two bushy olives sprung from the same root one olive wild the other wellbred stock no sodden gusty winds could ever pierce them nor could the sun’s sharp rays invade their depths nor could a downpour drench them through and through so dense they grew together tangling sidebyside odysseus crept beneath them scraping up at once a good wide bed for himself with both hands a ﬁne litter of dead leaves had drifted in enough to cover two men over even three in the wildest kind of winter known to man longenduring great odysseus overjoyed at the sight bedded down in the midst and heaped the leaves around him as a man will bury his glow ing brand in black ashes off on a lonely farmstead no neighbors near to keep a spark alive—no need to kindle ﬁre from somewhere else—so great odysseus buried himself in leaves and athena showered sleep upon his eyes … sleep in a swift wave delivering him from all his pains and labors blessed sleep that sealed his eyes at last book vi the princess and the stranger so there he lay at rest the stormtossed great odysseus borne down by his hard labors ﬁrst and now deep sleep as athena traveled through the countryside and reached the phaeacians’ city y ears ago they lived in a land of spacious dancingcircles hyperia all too close to the overbearing cyclops stronger violent brutes who harried them without end so their godlike king nausithous led the people off in a vast migration settled them in scheria far from the men who toil on this earth— he ﬂung up walls around the city built the houses raised the gods’ temples and shared the land for plowing but his fate had long since forced him down to death and now alcinous ruled and the gods made him wise straight to his house the cleareyed pallas went full of plans for great odysseus’ journey home she made her way to the gaily painted room where a young girl lay asleep … a match for the deathless gods in build and beauty nausicaa the daughter of generous king alcinous two handmaids fair as the graces slept beside her ﬂanking the two posts with the gleaming doors closed but the goddess drifted through like a breath of fresh air rushed to the girl’s bed an d hovering close she spoke in face and form like the shipman dymas’ daughter a girl the princess’ age and dearest to her heart disguised the brighteyed goddess chided “nausicaa how could your mother bear a careless girl like you look at your ﬁne clothes lying here neglected— with your marriage not far off the day you should be decked in all your glory and offer elegant dress to those who form your escort that’s how a bride’s good name goes out across the world and it brings her father and queenly mother joy come let’s go wash these clothes at the break of day— i’ll help you lend a hand and the work will ﬂy yo u w o n’ t s t a y u n w e d l o n g t h e n o b l e s t m e n in the country court you now all phaeacians just like you phaeaciaborn and raised so come ﬁrst thing in the morning press your kingly father to harness the mules and wagon for you all to carry your sashes dresses glossy spreads for your bed it’s so much nicer for you to ride than go on foot the washingpools are just too far from town” with that the brighteyed goddess sped away to olympus where they say the gods’ eterna l mansion stands unmoved never rocked by galewinds never drenched by rains nor do the drifting snows assail it no the clear air stretches away without a cloud and a great radiance plays across that world where the blithe gods live all their days in bliss there athena went once the brighteyed one had urged the princess on dawn soon rose on her splendid throne and woke nausicaa ﬁnely gowned still beguiled by her dream down she went through the house to tell her parents now her beloved father and mother she found them both inside her mother sat at the hearth with several waitingwomen spinning yarn on a spindle lustrous seablue wool her father she met as he left to join the lords at a council island nobles asked him to attend she stepped up close to him conﬁding “daddy dear i wonder won’t you have them harness a wagon for me the tall one with the good smooth wheels … so i can take our clothes to the river for a washing lovely things but lying before me all soiled and you yourself sitting among the princes debating points at your council you really should be wearing spotless linen then you have ﬁve sons fullgrown in the palace two of them married but three are lusty bachelors always demanding crisp shirts fresh from the wash when they go out to dance look at my duties— that all rests on me” so she coaxed too shy to touch on her hopes for marriage young warm hopes in her father’s presence but he saw through it all and answered quickly “i won’t deny you the mules my darling girl … i won’t deny you anything off you go and the men will harness a wagon the tall one with the good smooth wheels ﬁtted out with a cradle on the top” with that he called to the stablemen and they complied they trundled the wagon out now rolling smoothly backed the muleteam into the traces hitched them up while the princess brought her ﬁnery from the room and piled it into the wagon’s polished cradle her mother packed a hamper—treats of all kinds favorite things to refresh her daughter’s spirits— poured wine in a skin and as nausicaa climbed aboard the queen gave her a golden ﬂask of suppling olive oil for her and her maids to smooth on after bathing then taking the whip in hand and glistening reins she touched the mules to a start and out they clattered trotting on at a clip bearing the princess and her clothes and not alone her maids went wi th her stepping briskly too once they reached the banks of the river ﬂowing strong where the pools would never fail with plenty of water cool and clear bubbling up and rushing through to scour the darkest stains—they loosed the mules out from under the wagon yoke and chased them down the river’s rippling banks to graze on luscious clover down from the cradle they lifted clothes by the armload plunged them into the dark pools and stamped them down in the hollows one girl racing the next to ﬁnish ﬁrst until they’d scoured and rinsed off all the grime then they spread them out in a line along the beach where the surf had washed a pebbly scree ashore and once they’d bathed and smoothed their skin with oil they took their picnic sitt ing along the river’s banks and waiting for all the clothes to dry in the hot noon sun now fed to their hearts’ content the princess and her retinue threw their veils to the wind struck up a game of ball whitearmed nausicaa led their singing dancing beat … as lithe as artemis with her arrows striding down from a high peak—taygetus’ towering ridge or erymanthus— thrilled to race with the wild boar or bounding deer and nymphs of the hills race with her daughters of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder ranging the hills in sport and leto’s heart exults as head and shoulders over the rest her daughter rises unmistakable—she outshines them all though all are lovely so nausicaa shone among her maids a virgin still unwed but now as she was about to fold her clothes and yoke the mules and turn for home again now cleareyed pallas thought of what came next to make odysseus wake and see this young beauty and she would lead him to the phaeacians’ town the ball— the princess suddenly tossed it to a maid but it missed the girl splashed in a deep swirling pool and they all shouted out— and that woke great odysseus he sat up with a start puzzling his heart pounding “man of misery whose land have i lit on now what are they here—violent savage lawless or friendly to strangers godfearing men listen shouting echoing round me—women girls— or the nymphs who haunt the rugged mountaintops and the river springs and me adows lush with grass or am i really close to people who speak my language up with you see how the land lies see for yourself now …” muttering so great odysseus crept out of the bushes stripping off with his massive hand a leafy branch from the tangled olive growth to shield his body hide his private parts and out he stalked as a mountain lion exultant in his power strides through wind and rain and his eyes blaze and he charges sheep or oxen or chases wild deer but his hunger drives him on to go for ﬂocks even to raid the bestdefended homestead so odysseus moved out … about to mingle with all those lovely girls naked now as he was for the need drove him on a terrible sight all crusted caked with brine— they scattered in panic down the jutting beaches only alcinous’ daughter held fast for athena planted courage within her heart dissolved the trembling in her limbs and she ﬁrmly stood her ground and faced odysseus torn now— should he ﬂing his arms around her knees the young beauty plead for help or stand back plead with a winning word beg her to lead him to the town and lend him clothing this was the better way he thought plead now with a subtle winning word and stand well back don’t clasp her knees the girl might bridle yes he launched in at once endearing sly and suave “here i am at your mercy princess— are you a goddess or a mortal if one of the gods who rule the skies up there you’re artemis to the life the daughter of mighty zeus—i see her now—just look at your build your bearing your lithe ﬂowing grace … but if you’re one of the mortals living here on earth three times blest are your father your queenly mother three times over your brothers too how often their hearts must warm with joy to see yo u striding into the dances— such a bloom of beauty true but he is the one more blest than all other men alive that man who sways you with gifts and leads you home his bride i have never laid eyes on anyone like you neither man nor woman … i look at you and a sense of wonder takes me wait once i saw the like—in delos beside apollo’s altar— the young slip of a palmtree springing into the light there i’d sailed you see with a great army in my wake out on the long campaign that doomed my life to hardship that vision just as i stood there gazing rapt for hours … no shaft like that had ever risen up from the earth— so now i marvel at you my lady rapt enthralled too struck with awe to grasp you by the knees though pain has ground me down only yesterday the twentieth day did i escape the winedark sea till then the waves and the rushing gales had swept me on from the island of ogygia now some power has tossed me here doubtless to suffer still more torments on your shores i can’t believe they’ll stop long before that the gods will give me more still more compassion— princess please y ou after all that i have suffered you are the ﬁrst i’ve come to i know no one else none in your city no one in your land show me the way to town give me a rag for cover just some cloth some wrapper you carried with you here and may the good gods give you all your heart desires husband and house and lasting harmony too no ﬁner greater gift in the world than that … when man and woman posse ss their home two minds two hearts that work as one despair to their enemies joy to all their friends their own best claim to glory” “stranger” the whitearmed princess answered staunchly “friend you’re hardly a wicked man and no fool i’d say— it’s olympian zeus himself who hands our fortunes out to each of us in turn to the good and bad however zeus prefers … he gave you pain it seems y ou simply have to bear it but now seeing you’ve reached our city and our land you’ll never lack for clothing or any other gift the right of wornout suppliants come our way i’ll show you our town tell you our people’s name phaeacians we are who hold this city and this land and i am the daughter of generous king alcinous all our people’s power stems from him” she called out to her girls with lovely braids “stop my friends why run when you see a man surely you don’t think him an enemy do you there’s no one alive there never will be one who’d reach phaeacian soil and lay it waste the immortals love us far too much for that we live too far apart out in the surging sea off at the world’s end— no other mortals come to mingle with us but here’s an unlucky wanderer strayed our way and we must tend him well every stranger and beggar comes from zeus and whatever scrap we give him he’ll be glad to get so quick my girls give our newfound friend some food and drink and bathe the man in the river wherever you ﬁnd some shelter from the wind” at that they came to a halt and teased each other on and led odysseus down to a sheltered spot where he could ﬁnd a seat just as great alcinous’ daughter told them they laid out cloak and shirt for him to wear they gave him the golden ﬂask of suppling olive oil and pressed him to bathe himself in the river’s stream then thoughtful odysseus reassured the handmaids “stand where you are dear girls a good way off so i can rinse the brine from my shoulders now and rub myself with oil … how long it’s been since oil touched my skin but i won’t bathe in front of you i would be embarrassed— stark naked before young girls with lovely braids” the handmaids scurried off to tell their mistress great odysseus bathed in the river scrubbed his body clean of brine that clung to his back and broad shoulders scoured away the brackish scurf that caked his head and then once he had bathed all over rubbed in oil and donned the clothes the virgin princess gave him zeus’s daughter athena made him taller to all eyes his build more massive now and down from his brow she ran his curls like thick hyacinth clusters full of blooms as a master craftsman washes gold over beaten silver—a man the god of ﬁre and queen athena trained in every ﬁne technique— and ﬁnishes off his latest effort handsome work so she lavished splendor over his head and shoulders now and down to the beach he walked and sat apart glistening in his glory breathtaking yes and the princess gazed in wonder … then turned to her maids with lovely braided hair “listen my whitearmed girls to what i tell you the gods of olympus can’t be all against this man who’s come to mingle among our noble people at ﬁrst he seemed appalling i must say— now he seems like a god who rules the skies up there ah if only a man like that were called my husband lived right here pleased to stay forever … enough give the stranger food and drink my girls” they hung on her words and did her will at once set before odysseus food and drink and he ate and drank the great odysseus long deprived so ravenous now— it seemed like years since he had tasted food the whitearmed princess thought of one last thing folding the clothes she packed them into her painted wagon hitched the sharphoofed mules and climbing up herself nausicaa urged odysseus warmly urged her guest “up with you now my friend and off to town we go i’ll see you into my wise father’s palace where i promise you you’ll meet all the best phaeacians wait let’s do it this way you seem no fool to me while we’re passing along the ﬁelds and plowlands you follow the mules and wagon stepping briskly with all my maids i’ll lead the way myself but once we reach our city ringed by walls and strong high towers too with a ﬁne harbor either side … and the causeway in is narrow along the road the rolling ships are all hauled up with a slipway cleared for every vessel there’s our assembly round poseidon’s royal precinct built of quarried slabs planted deep in the earth here the sailors tend their black ships’ tackle cables and sails and plan e their oarblades down phaeacians you see care nothing for bow or quiver only for masts and oars and good trim ships themselves— we glory in our ships crossing the foaming seas but i shrink from all our seadogs’ nasty gossip some old salt might mock us behind our backs— we have our share of insolent types in town and one of the coarser sort spying us might say ‘now who’s that tall handsome stranger nausicaa has in tow where’d she light on him her husbandtobe just wait but who—some shipwrecked stray she’s taken up with some alien from abroad since nobody lives nearby unless it’s really a god come down from the blue to answer all her prayers and to have her all his days good riddance let the girl go roving to ﬁnd herself a man from foreign parts she only spurns her own— countless phaeacians round about who court her nothing but our best’ so they’ll scoff … just think of the scandal that would face me then i’d ﬁnd fault with a girl wh o carried on that way ﬂouting her parents’ wishes—father mother still alive— consorting with men before she’d tied the knot in public no stranger listen closely to what i say the sooner to win your swift voyage home at my father’s hands now you’ll ﬁnd a splendid grove along the road— poplars sacred to pallas— a bubbling spring’s inside and meadows run around it there lies my father’s estate his blooming orchard too as far from town as a man’s strong shout can carry take a seat there wait a while and give us time to make it into town and reach my father’s house then when you think we’re home walk on yourself to the city ask the way to my father’s palace generous king alcinous y ou cannot miss it even an innocent child could guide you there no other phaeacian’s house is built like that so grand the palace of alcinous our great hero once the mansion and courtyard have enclosed you go quickly across the hall until you reach my mother beside the hearth she si ts in the ﬁre’s glare spinning yarn on a spindle seablue wool— a stirring sight you’ll see … she leans against a pillar her ladies sit behind and my father’s throne is drawn up close beside her there he sits and takes his wine a mortal like a god go past him grasp my mother’s knees—if you want to see the day of your return rejoicing soon even if your home’s a world away if only the queen will take you to her heart then there’s hope that you will see your loved ones reach your own grand house your native land at last” at that she touched the mules with her shining whip and they quickly left the running stream behind the team trotted on their hoofs wove in and out she drove them back with care so all the rest maids and odysseus could keep the pace on foot and she used the whip discreetly the sun sank as they reached the hallowed grove sacred to athena where odysseus stopped and sat and said a prayer at once to mighty zeus’s daughter “hear me daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder— tireless one athena now hear my prayer at last for you never heard me then when i was shattered when the famous god of eart hquakes wrecked my craft grant that here among the phaeacian people i may ﬁnd some mercy and some love” so he prayed and athena heard his prayer but would not yet appear to him undisguised she stood in awe of her father’s brother lord of the sea who still seethed on still churning with rage against the great odysseus till he reached his native land book vii phaeacia’s halls and gardens now as odysseus long an exile prayed in athena’s grove the hardy muleteam drew the princess toward the city reaching her father’s splendid halls she reined in just at the gates—her brothers clustering round her men like gods released the mules from the yoke and brought the clothes indoors as nausicaa made her way toward her bedroom there her chambermaid lit a ﬁre for her— eurymedusa the old woman who’d come from apiraea years ago when the rolling ships had sailed her in and the country picked her out as king alcinous’ prize for he ruled all the phaeacians they obeyed him like a god once she had nursed the whitearmed princess in the palace now she lit a ﬁre and made her supper in the room at the same time odysseus set off toward the city pallas athena harboring kindness for the hero drifted a heavy mist around him shielding him from any swaggering island er who’d cross his path provoke him with taunts an d search out who he was instead as he was about to enter the welcome city the brighteyed goddess herself came up to greet him there for all the world like a young girl holding a pitcher standing facetoface with the visitor who asked “little girl now wouldn’t you be my guide to the palace of the one they call alcinous the king who rules the people of these parts i am a stranger you see weighed down with troubles come this way from a distant faroff shore so i know no one here none at all in your city and the farmlands round about” “oh yes sir good old stranger” the brighteyed goddess said “i’ll show you the very palace that you’re after— the king lives right beside my noble father come quietly too and i will lead the way now not a glance at anyone not a question the men here never suffer strangers gladly have no love for hosting a man from foreign lands all they really trust are their fast ﬂying ships that cross the mighty ocean gifts of poseidon ah what ships they are— quick as a bird quick as a darting thought” and pallas athena sped away in the lead as he followed in her footsteps man and goddess but the famed phaeacian sailors never saw him right in their midst striding down their streets athena the one with lovely braids would not permit it the awesome goddess poured an enchanted mist around him harboring kindness for odysseus in her heart and he marveled now at the balanced ships and havens the meeting grounds of the great lords and the long ramparts looming coped and crowned with palisades of stakes— an amazing sight to see … and once they reached the king’s resplendent halls the brighteyed goddess cried out “good old stranger here here is the very palace that you’re after— i’ve pointed you all the way here you’ll ﬁnd our princes dear to the gods busy feasting yo u g o o n i n s i d e b e b o l d n o t h i n g t o f e a r in every venture the bold man comes off best even the wanderer bound from distant shores the queen is the ﬁrst you’ll light on in the halls arete she is called and earns the name she answers all our prayers she comes in fact from the same stock that bred our king alcinous first came nausithous son of the earthquake god poseidon and periboea the lovely matchless beauty the youngest daughter of ironwilled eurymedon king of the overweening giants years ago he led that reckless clan to its own ruin killed himself in the bargain but the sealord lay in love with periboea and she produced a son nausithous that lionheart who ruled phaeacia well now nausithous had two sons rhexenor and alcinous but the lord of the silver bow apollo shot rhexenor down— married true yet still without a son in the halls he left one child behind a daughter named arete alcinous made the girl his wife and honors her as no woman is honored on th is earth of all the wives now keeping households un der their husbands’ sway such is her pride of place and always will be so dear to her loving children to alcinous himself and all our people they gaze on her as a god saluting her warmly on her walks through town she lacks nothing in good sense and judgment— she can dissolve quarrels even among men whoever wins her sympathies if only our queen will take you to her heart then there’s hope that you will see your loved ones reach your highroofed house your native land at last” and with that vow the brighteyed goddess sped away over the barren sea leaving welcome scheria far behind and reaching marathon and the spacious streets of athens entered erechtheus’ sturdy halls athena’s stronghold now as odysseus approached alcinous’ famous house a rush of feelings stirred within his heart bringing him to a standstill even before he crossed the bronze threshold … a radiance strong as the moon or rising sun came ﬂooding through the highroofed halls of generous king alcinous walls plated in bronze crowned with a circling frieze glazed as blue as lapis ran to left and right from outer gates to the deepest court recess solid golden doors enclosed the palace up from the bronze threshold silver doorposts rose with silver lintel above and golden handle hooks and dogs of gold and silver were stationed either side forged by the god of ﬁre with all his cunning craft to keep watch on generous king alcinous’ palace now his immortal guarddogs ageless all their days inside to left and right in a long unbroken row from farthest outer gate to the inmost chamber thrones stood backed against the wall each draped with a ﬁnely spun brocade women’s handsome work here the phaeacian lords would sit enthroned dining drinking—the feast ﬂowed on forever and young boys molded of gold set on pedestals standing ﬁrm were lifting torches high in their hands to ﬂare through the nights and light the feasters down the hall and alcinous has some ﬁfty servingwomen in his house some turning the handmill grind the appleyellow grain some weave at their webs or sit and spin their yarn ﬁngers ﬂickering quick as aspen leaves in the wind and the densely woven woolens dripping oil droplets just as phaeacian men excel the world at sailing driving their swift ships on the open seas so the women excel at all the arts of weaving that is athena’s gift to them beyond all others— a genius for lovely work and a ﬁne mind too outside the courtyard fronting the high gates a magniﬁcent orchard stretches four acres deep with a strong fence running round it sidetoside here luxuriant trees are always in their prime pomegranates and pears and apples glowing red succulent ﬁgs and olives swelling sleek and dark and the yield of all these trees will never ﬂag or die neither in winter nor in summer a harvest all year round for the west wind always breathing through will bring some fruits to the bud and others warm to ripeness— pear mellowing ripe on pear apple on apple cluster of grapes on cluster ﬁg crowding ﬁg and here is a teeming vineyard planted for the kings beyond it an open level bank where the vintage grapes lie baking to raisins in the sun while pickers gather others some they trample down in vats and here in the front rows bunches of unripe grapes have hardly shed their blooms while others under the sunlight slowly darken purple and there by the last rows are beds of greens bordered and plotted greens of every kind glistening fresh year in year out and last there are two springs one rippling in channels over the whole orchard—the other ﬂanking it rushes under the palace gates to bubble up in front of the lofty roofs where the city people come and draw their water such the gifts the glories showered down by the gods on king alcinous’ realm and there odysseus stood gazing at all this bounty a man who’d borne so much … once he’d had his ﬁll of marveling at it all he crossed the threshold quickly strode inside the palace here he found the phaeacian lords and captains tipping out libations now to the guide and giantkiller hermes the god to whom they would always pour the ﬁnal cup before they sought their beds odysseus went on striding down the hall the man of many struggles shrouded still in the mist athena drifted round him till he reached arete and alcinous the king and then the moment he ﬂung his arms around arete’s knees the godsent mist rolled back to reveal the great man and silence seized the feasters all along the hall— seeing him right before their eyes they marveled gazing on him now as odysseus pleaded “queen arete daughter of godlike king rhexenor here after many trials i come to beg for mercy your husband’s yours and all these feasters’ here may the gods endow them with fortune all their lives may each hand down to his sons the riches in his house and the pride of place the realm has granted him but as for myself grant me a rapid convoy home to my own native land how far away i’ve been from all my loved ones—how long i have suffered” pleading so the man sank down in the ashes just at the hearth beside the blazing ﬁre while all the rest stayed hushed stockstill at last the old revered echeneus broke the spell the eldest lord in phaeacia ﬁnest speaker too a past master at all the island’s ancient ways impelled by kindness now he rose and said “this is no way alcinous how indecent look our guest on the ground in the ashes by the ﬁre yo u r p e o p l e a r e h o l d i n g b a c k w a i t i n g f o r y o u r s i g n a l come raise him up and seat the stranger now in a silverstudded chair and tell the heralds to mix more wine for all so we can pour out cups to zeus who loves the lightning champion of suppliants—suppliants’ rights are sacred and let the housekeeper give our guest his supper unstinting with her stores” hearing that alcinous poised in all his majesty took the hand of the seasoned worldlywise odysseus raised him up from the hearth and sat him down in a burnished chair displacing his own son the courtly lord laodamas who had sat beside him the son he loved the most a maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so the guest might rinse his hands then pulled a gleaming table to his side a staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve him appetizers aplenty too lavish with her bounty as longsuffering great odysseus ate and drank the hallowed king alcinous called his herald “come pontonous mix the wine in the bowl pour rounds to all our banqueters in the house so we can pour out cups to zeus who loves the lightning champion of suppliants—suppliants’ rights are sacred” at that pontonous mixed the heady honeyed wine and tipped ﬁrst drops for the god in every cup then poured full rounds for all and once they’d poured libations out and drunk to their hearts’ content alcinous rose and addressed his island people “hear me lords and captains of phaeacia hear what the heart inside me has to say now our feast ﬁnished home you go to sleep but at dawn we call the elders in to full assembly host our guest in the palace sacriﬁce to the gods and then we turn our minds to his passage home so under our convoy our new friend can travel back to his own land—no toil no troubles—soon rejoicing even if his home’s a world away and on the way no pain or hardship suffered not till he sets foot on native ground again there in the future he must suffer all that fate and the overbearing spinners spun out on his life line the very day his mother gave him birth … but if he’s one of the deathless powers out of the blue the gods are working now in strange new ways always up to now they came to us facetoface whenever we’d give them grand glorious sacriﬁces— they always sat beside us here and shared our feasts even when some lonely traveler meets them on the roads they never disguise themselves we’re too close kin for that close as the wild giants are the cyclops too” “a l c i n o u s ” wary odysseus countered “cross that thought from your mind i’m nothing like the immortal gods who rule the skies either in build or breeding i’m just a mortal man whom do you know most saddled down with sorrow they are the ones i’d equal grief for grief and i could tell a tale of still more hardship all i’ve suffered thanks to the gods’ will but despite my misery let me ﬁnish dinner the belly’s a shameless dog there’s nothing worse always insisting pressing it never lets us forget— destroyed as i am my heart racked with sadness sick with anguish still it keeps demanding ‘eat drink’ it blots out all the memory of my pain commanding ‘fill me up’ but you at the ﬁrst light of day hurry please to set your unlucky guest on his own home soil how much i have suffered … oh just let me see my lands my servingmen and the grand highroofed house— then i can die in peace” all burst into applause urging passage home for their newfound friend his pleading rang so true and once they’d poured libations out and drunk to their hearts’ content each one made his way to rest in his own house but king odysseus still remained at hall seated beside the royal alcinous and arete as servants cleared the cups and plates away the whitearmed queen arete took the lead she’d spotted the cape and shirt odysseus wore ﬁne clothes she’d made herself with all her women so now her words ﬂew brusquely sharply “stranger i’ll be the ﬁrst to question you—myself who are you where are you from who gave you the clothes you’re wearing now didn’t you say you reached us roving on the sea” “what hard labor queen” the man of craft replied “to tell you the story of my troubles start to ﬁnish the gods on high have given me my share still this much i will tell you … seeing you probe and press me so intently there is an island ogygia lying far at sea where the daughter of atlas calypso has her home the seductive nymph with lovely braids—a danger too and no one god or mortal dares approach her there but i cursed as i am some power brought me to her hearth alone when zeus with a whitehot bolt had crushed my racing warship down the winedark sea there all the rest of my loyal shipmates died but i locking my arms around my good ship’s keel drifted along nine days on the tenth at dead of night the gods cast me up on ogygia calypso’s island home of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids and the goddess took me in in all her kindness welcomed me warmly cherished me even vowed to make me immortal ageless all my days— but she never won the heart inside me never seven endless years i remained there always drenching with my tears the immortal clothes calypso gave me then at last when the eighth came wheeling round she insisted that i sail—inspired by warnings sent from zeus perhaps or her own mind had changed she saw me on my way in a solid craft tight and trim and gave me full provisions food and mellow wine immortal clothes to wear and summoned a wind to bear me onward fair and warm and seventeen days i sailed making headway well on the eighteenth shadowy mountains slowly loomed … your land my heart leapt up unlucky as i am doomed to be comrade still to many hardships many pains the god of earthquakes piled upon me loosing the winds against me blocking passage through heaving up a terriﬁc sea beyond belief—nor did the whitecaps let me cling to my craft fo r all my desperate groaning no the squalls shattered her stem to stern but i i swam hard i plowed my way through those dark gulfs till at last the wind and current bore me to your shores but here had i tried to land the breakers would have hurled me smashed me against the jagged cliffs of that grim coast so i pulled away swam back till i reached a river the perfect spot at last or so it struck me free of rocks with a windbreak from the gales so ﬁghting for life i ﬂung myself ashore and the godsent bracing night came on at once clambering up from the river big with zeus’s rains i bedded down in the brush my body heaped with leaves and a god poured down a boundless sleep upon me yes and there in the leaves exhausted sick at heart i slept the whole night through and on to the break of day and on into high noon and the sun was wheeling down when sweet sleep set me free and i looked up and there were your daughter’s maids at play on the beach and she she moved among them like a deathless goddess i begged her for help and not once did her sense of tact desert her she behaved as you’d never hope to ﬁnd in one so young not in a random meeting— time and again the youngsters prove so ﬂighty not she she gave me food aplenty and shining wine a bath in the river too and gave me all this clothing that’s my whole story wrenching to tell but true” “a h b u t i n o n e r e g a r d m y f r i e n d ” t h e k i n g r e p l i e d “her good sense missed the mark this daughter of mine she never escorted you to our house with all her maids but she was the ﬁrst you asked for care and shelter” “y our majesty” diplomatic odysseus answered “don’t ﬁnd fault with a ﬂawless daughter now not for my sake please she urged me herself to follow with her maids i chose not to fearing embarrassment in fact— what if you took offense seeing us both together suspicious we are we men who walk the earth” “oh no my friend” alcinous stated ﬂatly “i’m hardly a man for reckless idle anger balance is best in all things father zeus athena and lord apollo if only— seeing the man you are seeing we think as one— you could wed my daughter and be my soninlaw and stay right here with us i’d give you a house and great wealth—if you chose to stay that is no phaeacian would hold you back by force the curse of father zeus on such a thing and about your convoy home you rest assured i have chosen the day and i decree it is tomorrow and all that voyage long you’ll lie in a deep sleep while my people sail you on through calm and gentle tides till you reach your land and house or any place you please true even if landfall lies more distant than euboea off at the edge of the world … so say our crews at least who saw it once that time they carried the goldhaired rhadamanthys out to visit tityus son of mother earth imagine there they sailed and back they came in the same day they ﬁnished the homeward run with no strain at all yo u ’ l l s e e f o r y o u r s e l f h o w f a r t h e y t o p t h e b e s t — my ships and their young shipmates tossing up the whitecaps with their oars” so he vowed and the jongenduring great odysseus glowed with joy and raised a prayer and called the god by name “father zeus on high— may the king fulﬁll his promises one and all then his fame would ring through the fertile earth and never die—and i should reach my native land at last” and now as the two men exchanged their hopes the whitearmed queen instructed her palace maids to make a bed in the porch’s shelter lay down some heavy purple throws for the bed itself and over it spread some blankets thick woolly robes a warm covering laid on top torches in hand they left the hall and fell to work at once briskly prepared a good snug restingplace and then returned to odysseus urged the guest “up friend time for sleep y our bed is made” how welcome the thought of sleep to that man now … so there after many trials odysseus lay at rest on a corded bed inside the echoing colonnade alcinous slept in chambers deep in his lofty house where the queen his wife arranged and shared their bed book viii a day for songs and contests when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more royal alcinous hallowed island king rose from bed and great odysseus raider of cities rose too poised in his majesty alcinous led the way to phaeacia’s meeting grounds built for all beside the harbored ships both men sat down on the polished stone benches sidebyside as athena started roaming up and down the town in build and voice the wise alcinous’ herald furthering plans for odysseus’ journey home and stopped beside each citizen urged them all “come this way you lords and captains of phaeacia come to the meeting grounds and learn about the stranger a new arrival here at our wise king’s palace now he’s here from roving the ocean driven far off course— he looks like a deathless god” rousing their zeal their curiosity each and every man and soon enough the assembly seats were ﬁlled with people thronging gazing in wonder at the seasoned man of war … over odysseus’ head and shoulders now athena lavished a marvelous splendor yes making him taller more massive to all eyes so phaeacians might regar d the man with kindness awe and respect as well and he might win through the many trials they’d pose to test the hero’s strength once they’d grouped crowding the meeting grounds alcinous rose and addressed his island people “hear me lords and captains of phaeacia hear what the heart inside me has to say this stranger here our guest— i don’t know who he is or whether he comes from sunrise lands or the western lands of evening but he has come in his wanderings to my palace he pleads for passage he begs we guarantee it so now as in years gone by let us press on and grant him escort no one i tell you no one who comes to my house will languish long here heartsick for convoy home come my people haul a black ship down to the bright sea rigged for her maiden voyage— enlist a crew of ﬁftytwo young sailors the best in town who’ve proved their strength before let all hands lash their oars to the thwarts then disembark come to my house and fall in for a banquet quickly i’ll lay on a princely feast for all so then these are the orders i issue to our crews for the rest you sceptered princes here you come to my royal halls so we can give this stranger a hero’s welcome in our palace— no one here refuse call in the inspired bard demodocus god has given the man the gift of song to him beyond all others the power to please however the spirit stirs him on to sing” with those commands alcinous led the way and a ﬁle of sceptered princes took his lead while the herald went to ﬁnd the gifted bard and the ﬁftytwo young sailors duly chosen briskly following orders went down to the shore of the barren salt sea and once they reached the ship at the surf’s edge ﬁrst they hauled the craft into deeper water stepped the mast amidships canvas brailed they made oars fast in the leather oarlock straps moored her riding high on the swell then disembarked and made their way to wise alcinous’ highroofed halls there colonnades and courts and rooms were overﬂowing with crowds a mounting host of people young and old the king slaughtered a dozen sheep to feed his guests eight boars with shining tusks and a pair of shambling oxen these they skinned and dressed and then laid out a feast to ﬁll the heart with savor in came the herald now leading along the faithful bard the muse adored above all others true but her gifts were mixed with good and evil both she stripped him of sight but gave the man the power of stirring rapturous song pontonous brought the bard a silverstudded chair right amid the feasters leaning it up against a central column—hung his high clear lyre on a peg above his head and showed him how to reach up with his hands and lift it down and the herald placed a table by his side with a basket full of bread and cup of wine for him to sip when his spirit craved refreshment all reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they’d put aside desire for food and drink the muse inspired the bard to sing the famous deeds of ﬁghting heroes— the song whose fame had reached the skies those days the strife between odysseus and achilles peleus’ son … how once at the gods’ ﬂowing feast the captains clashed in a savage war of words while agamemnon lord of armies rejoiced at heart that achaea’s bravest men were battling so for this was the victory sign that apollo prophesied at his shrine in pytho when agamemnon strode across the rocky threshold asking the oracle for advice— the start of the tidal waves of ruin tumbling down on troy’s and achaea’s forces both at once thanks to the will of zeus who rules the world that was the song the famous harper sang but odysseus clutching hi s ﬂaring seablue cape in both powerful hands drew it over his head and buried his handsome face ashamed his hosts might see him shedding tears whenever the rapt bard would pause in the song he’d lift the cape from his head wipe off his tears and hoisting his doublehandled cup pour it out to the gods but soon as the bard would start again impelled to sing by phaeacia’s lords who reveled in his tale again odysseus hid his face and wept his weeping went unmarked by all the others only alcinous sitting close beside him noticed his guest’s tears heard the groan in the man’s labored breathing and said at once to the master mariners around him “hear me my lords and captains of phaeacia by now we’ve had our ﬁll of food wellshared and the lyre too our loyal friend at banquets now out we go again and test ourselves in contests games of every kind—so our guest can tell his friends when he reaches home how far we excel the world at boxing wrestling jumping speed of foot” he forged ahead and the rest fell in behind the herald hung the ringing lyre back on its peg and taking demodocus by the hand led him from the palace guiding him down the same path the island lords had just pursued keen to watch the contests they reached the meeting grounds with throngs of people streaming in their trail as a press of young champions rose for competition topsail and riptide rose the helmsman rowhard too and seaman and sternman surfatthebeach and strokeoar breaker and bowsprit racingthewind and swingaboard and seagirt the son of greatﬂeet shipwrightson and the son of launcher broadsea rose up too a match for murderous ares death to men— in looks and build the best of all phaeacians after gallant laodamas the captain of the people laodamas rose with two more sons of great alcinous halius bred to the sea and clytoneus famed for ships and now the games began the ﬁrst event a footrace … they toed the line— and broke ﬂat out from the start with a fast pack ﬂying down the ﬁeld in a whirl of dust and clytoneus the prince outstripped them all by far ﬂashing ahead the length two mules will plow a furrow before he turned for home leaving the pack behind and raced to reach the crowds next the wrestling grueling sport they grappled locked and broadsea pinning the strongest cham pions won the bouts next in the jumping seagirt leapt and beat the ﬁeld in the discus rowhard up and outhurled them all by far and the king’s good son laodamas boxed them to their knees when all had enjoyed the games to their hearts’ content alcinous’ son laodamas spurred them “come my friends let’s ask our guest if he knows the ropes of any sport he’s no mean man not with a build like that … look at his thighs his legs and what a pair of arms— his massive neck his big rippling strength nor is he past his prime just beaten down by one too many blows nothing worse than the sea i always say to crush a man the strongest man alive” and broadsea put in quickly “well said laodamas right to the point go up to the fellow challenge him yourself” on that cue the noble prince strode up before odysseus front and center asking “come stranger sir won’t you try your hand at our contests now if you have skill in any it’s ﬁt and proper for you to know your sports what greater glory attends a man while he’s alive than what he wins with his racing feet and striving hands come and compete then throw your cares to the wind it won’t be long your journey’s not far off— your ship’s already hauled down to the sea your crew is set to sail” “laodamas” quick to the mark odysseus countered sharply “why do you taunt me so with such a challenge pains weigh on my spirit now not your sports— i’ve suffered much already struggled hard but here i sit amid your assembly still starved for passage home begging your king begging all your people” “oh i knew it” broadsea broke in mocking him to his face “i never took you for someone skilled in games the kind that real men play throughout the world not a chance y ou’re some skipper of proﬁteers roving the high seas in his scudding craft reckoning up his freight with a keen eye out for homecargo grabbing the gold he can yo u ’r e n o a t h l e t e i s e e t h a t ” with a dark glance wily odysseus shot back “indecent talk my friend yo u y o u ’r e a r e c k l e s s f o o l — i s e e that so the gods don’t hand out all their gifts at once not build and brains and ﬂowing speech to all one man may fail to impress us with his looks but a god can crown his words with beauty charm and men look on with delight when he speaks out never faltering ﬁlled with winning selfcontrol he shines forth at assembly grounds and people gaze at him like a god when he walks through the streets another man may look like a deathless one on high but there’s not a bit of grace to crown his words just like you my ﬁne handsome friend not even a god could improve those lovely looks of yours but the mind inside is worthless yo u r s l a n d e r f a n s t h e a n g e r i n m y h e a r t i’m no stranger to sports—for all your taunts— i’ve held my place in the front ranks i tell you long as i could trust to my youth and striving hands but now i’m wrestled down by pain and hardship look i’ve borne my share of struggles cleaving my way through wars of men and pounding waves at sea nevertheless despite so many blows i’ll give your games a whirl y our insults cut to the quick—you rouse my ﬁghting blood” up he sprang cloak and all and seized a discus huge and heavy more weighty by far than those the phaeacians used to hurl and test each other wheeling round he let loose with his great hand and the stone whirred on—and down to ground they went those lords of the long oars and master mariners cringing under the rock’s onrush soaring lightly out of his grip ﬂying away past all the other marks and queen athena built like a man staked out the spot and cried with a voice of triumph “even a blind man friend could ﬁnd your mark by groping round— it’s not mixed up in the crowd it’s far in front there’s nothing to fear in this event— no one can touch you much less beat your distance” at that the heart of the longsuffering hero laughed so glad to ﬁnd a ready friend in the crowd that lighter in mood he challenged all phaeacia’s best “now go match that you young pups and straightaway i’ll hurl you another just as far i swear or even farther all the rest of you anyone with the spine and spirit step right up and try me—you’ve incensed me so— at boxing wrestling racing nothing daunts me any phaeacian here except laodamas himself the man’s my host who would ﬁght his friend he’d have to be goodfornothing senseless yes to challenge his host and come to grips in games in a faroff land at that he’d cut his own legs short but there are no others i’d deny or think beneath me— i’ll take on all contenders gladly test them headtohead i’m not half bad in the world of games where men compete well i know how to handle a ﬁne polished bow the ﬁrst to hit my man in a mass of enemies even with rows of comrades pressing near me taking aim with our shaf ts to hit our targets philoctetes alone outshot me there at troy when ranks of achaean archers bent their bows of the rest i’d say that i outclass them all— men still alive who eat their bread on earth but i’d never vie with the men of days gone by not heracles not eurytus of oechalia—archers who rivaled immortal powers with their bows that’s why noble eurytus died a sudden death no old age creeping upon him in his halls … apollo shot him down enraged that the man had challenged him the archer god as for spears i can ﬂing a spear as far as the next man wings an arrow only at sprinting i fear you’d leave me in the dust i’ve taken a shameful beating out on heavy seas no conditioning there on shipboard day by day my legs have lost their spring” he ﬁnished all stood silent hushed only alcinous found a way to answer “stranger friend—nothing you say among us seems ungracious yo u s i m p l y w a n t t o d i s p l a y t h e g i f t s y o u ’r e b o r n w i t h stung that a youngster marched up to you in the games mocking ridiculing your prowess as no one would who had some sense of ﬁt and proper speech but come now hear me out so you can tell our story to other lords as you sit and feast in your own halls someday your own wife and your children by your side remembering there our island prowess here what skills great zeus has given us as well down all the years from our fathers’ days till now we’re hardly worldclass boxers or wrestlers i admit but we can race like the wind we’re champion sailors too and always dear to our hearts the feast the lyre and dance and changes of fresh clothes our warm baths and beds so come—all you phaeacian masters of the dance— now dance away so our guest can tell his friends when he reaches home how far we excel the world in sailing nimble footwork dance and song go someone quickly fetch demodocus now his ringing lyre it must be hanging somewhere in the palace” at the king’s word the herald sprang to his feet and ran to fetch the ringing lyre from the house and stewards rose nine in all picked from the realm to set the stage for contests mastersatarms who leveled the dancingﬂoor to make a ﬁne broad ring the herald returned and placed the vibrant lyre now in demodocus’ hands and the bard moved toward the center ﬂanked by boys in the ﬂush of youth skilled dancers who stamped the ground with marvelous pulsing steps as odysseus gazed at their ﬂying ﬂashing feet his heart aglow with wonder a rippling prelude— now the bard struck up an irresistible song the love of ares and aphrodite crowned with ﬂowers … how the two had ﬁrst made love in hephaestus’ mansion all in secret ares had showered her with gifts and showered hephaestus’ marriage bed with shame but a messenger ran to tell the god of ﬁre— helios lord of the sun who’d spied the couple lost in each other’s arms and making love hephaestus hearing the heartwounding story bustled toward his forge brooding on his revenge— planted the huge anvil on its block and beat out chains not to be slipped or broken all to pin the lovers on the spot this snare the firegod forged ablaze with his rage at war then limped to the room where the bed of love stood ﬁrm and round the posts he poured the chains in a sweeping net with streams of others ﬂowing down from the roofbeam gossamerﬁne as spider webs no man could see not even a blissful god— the smith had forged a masterwork of guile once he’d spun that cunning trap around his bed he feigned a trip to the wellbuilt town of lemnos dearest to him by far of all the towns on earth but the god of battle kept no blind man’s watch as soon as he saw the master craftsman leave he plied his golden reins and arrived at once and entered the famous god of ﬁre’s mansion chaﬁng with lust for aphrodite crowned with ﬂowers she’d just returned from her father’s palace mighty zeus and now she sat in her rooms as ares strode right in and grasped her hand with a warm seductive urging “quick my darling come let’s go to bed and lose ourselves in love y our husband’s away— by now he must be off in the wilds of lemnos consorting with his raucous sintian friends” so he pressed and her heart raced with joy to sleep with war and off they went to bed and down they lay— and down around them came those cunning chains of the crafty god of ﬁre showering down now till the couple could not move a limb or lift a ﬁnger— then they knew at last there was no way out not now but now the glorious crippled smith was drawing near … he’d turned around miles short of the lemnos coast for the sungod kept his watch and told hephaestus all so back he rushed to his house his heart consumed with anguish halting there at the gates seized with savage rage he howled a terrible cry imploring all the gods “father zeus look here— the rest of you happy gods who live forever— here is a sight to make you laugh revolt you too just because i am crippled zeus’s daughter aphrodite will always spurn me and love that devastating ares just because of his stunning looks and racer’s legs while i am a weakling lame from birth and who’s to blame both my parents—who else if only they’d never bred me just look at the two lovers … crawled inside my bed locked in each other’s arms—the sight makes me burn but i doubt they’ll want to lie that way much longer not a moment more—mad as they are for each other no they’ll soon tire of bedding down together but then my cunning chains will bind them fast till our father pays my bridegifts back in full all i handed him for that shameless bitch his daughter irresistible beauty—all unbridled too” so hephaestus wailed as the gods came crowding up to his bronzeﬂoored house poseidon god of the earthquake came and hermes came the running god of luck and the archer lord apollo while modesty kept each goddess to her mansion the immortals givers of all good things stood at the gates and uncontrollable laughter burst from the happy gods when they saw the god of ﬁre’s subtle cunning work one would glance at his neighbor laughing out “a b a d d a y f o r a d u l t e r y s l o w o u t s t r i p s t h e s w i f t ” “look how limping hephaestus conquers war quickest of all the gods who rule olympus” “the cripple wins by craft” “the adulterer he will pay the price” so the gods would banter among themselves but lord apollo goaded hermes on “tell me quicksilver giver of all good things— even with those unwieldy sh ackles wrapped around you how would you like to bed the golden aphrodite” “oh apollo if only” the giantkiller cried “a r c h e r b i n d m e d o w n w i t h t r i p l e t h o s e e n d l e s s c h a i n s let all you gods look on and all you goddesses too— how i’d love to bed that golden aphrodite” a peal of laughter broke from the deathless ones but not poseidon not a smile from him he kept on begging the famous smith to loose the god of war pleading his words ﬂying “let him go i guarantee you ares will pay the price whatever you ask hephaestus whatever’s right in the eyes of all the gods” but the famous crippled smith appealed in turn “god of the earthquake please don’t urge this on me a pledge for a worthless man is a worthless pledge indeed what if he slips out of hi s chains—his debts as well how could i shackle you while all the gods look on” but the god of earthquakes reassured the smith “look hephaestus if ares scuttles off and away squirming out of his debt i’ll pay the ﬁne myself” and the famous crippled smith complied at last “now there’s an offer i really can’t refuse” with all his force the god of ﬁre loosed the chains and the two lovers free of the bonds that overwhelmed them so sprang up and away at once and the wargod sped to thrace while love with her telltale laughter sped to paphos cyprus isle where her grove and scented altar stand there the graces bathed and anointed her with oil ambrosial oil the bloom that clings to the gods who never die and swathed her round in gowns to stop the heart … an ecstasy—a vision that was the song the famous harper sang and odysseus retished every note as the islanders the lords of the long oars an d master mariners rejoiced next the king asked halius and laodamas to dance the two alone since none could match that pair so taking in hand a gleaming seablue ball made by the craftsman polybus—arching back one prince would hurl it toward the shadowy clouds as the other leaping high into the air would catch it quickly nimbly before his feet hit ground again once they’d vied at throwing the ball straight up they tossed it back and forth in a blur of hands as they danced across the earth that feeds us all while boys around the ring stamped out the beat and a splendid rhythmic drumming sound arose and good odysseus looked at his host exclaiming “king alcinous shining among your island people you boasted phaeacia’s dancers are the best— they prove your point—i watch and i’m amazed” his praises cheered the hallowed island king who spoke at once to the master mariners around him “hear me my lords and captains of phaeacia our guest is a man of real taste i’d say come let’s give him the parting gifts a guest deserves there are twelve peers of the realm who rule our land thirteen counting myself let each of us contribute a fresh cloak and shirt and a bar of precious gold gather the gifts together hurry so our guest can have them all in hand when he goes to dine his spirit ﬁlled with joy as for broadsea let him make amends mantoman with his words as well as gifts his ﬁrst remarks were hardly ﬁt to hear” all assented and gave their own commands each noble sent a page to fetch his gifts and broadsea volunteered in turn obliging “great alcinous shining among our island people of course i’ll make amends to our newfound friend as you request i’ll give the man this sword it’s solid bronze and the hilt has silver studs the sheath around it ivory freshly carved here’s a gift our guest will value highly” he placed the silverstudded sword in odysseus’ hands with a burst of warm words “farewell stranger sir— if any remark of mine gave you offense may stormwinds snatch it up and sweep it off may the gods grant you safe passage home to see your wife— you’ve been so far from loved ones suffered so” tactful odysseus answered him in kind “a n d a w a r m f a r e w e l l t o y o u t o o m y f r i e n d may the gods grant you good fortune— may you never miss this sword this gift you give with such salutes y ou’ve made amends in full” with that he slung the silverstudded sword across his shoulder as the sun sank his glittering gifts arrived and proud heralds bore them into the hall where sons of king alcinous took them over spread them out before their noble mother’s feet— a grand array of gifts the king in all his majesty led the rest of his peers inside following in a ﬁle and down they sat on rows of highbacked chairs the king turned to the queen and urged her “come my dear bring in an elegant chest the best you have and lay inside it a fresh cloak and shirt your own gifts then heat a bronze cauldron over the ﬁre boil water so once our guest has bathed and reviewed his gifts— all neatly stacked for sailing gifts our phaeacian lords have brought him now— he’ll feast in peace and hear the harper’s songs and i will give him this gorgeous golden cup of mine so he’ll remember alcinous all his days to come when he pours libations out in his own house to father zeus and the other gods on high” and at that arete told her servingwomen “set a great threelegged cauldron over the ﬁre— do it right away” and hoisting over the blaze a cauldron ﬁlling it brim ful with bathing water they piled fresh logs beneath and lit them quickly the ﬁre lapped at the vessel’s belly the water warmed meanwhile the queen had a polished chest brought forth from an inner room and laid the priceless gifts inside the clothes and gold the phaeacian lords had brought and added her own gifts a cloak and a ﬁne shirt and gave her guest instructions quick and clear “now look to the lid yourself and bind it fast with a good tight knot so no one can rob you on your voyage—drifting into a sweet sleep as the black ship sails you home” hearing that the stormtossed man secured the lid straightway he battened it fast with a swift intricate knot the lady circe had taught him long ago and the housekeeper invited him at once to climb into a waiting tub and bathe— a hot steaming bath … what a welcome sight to odysseus’ eyes he’d been a stranger to comforts such as these since he left the lovelyhaired calypso’s house yet all those years he enjoyed such comforts there neverending as if he were a god … and now when maids had washed him rubbed him down with oil and drawn warm ﬂeece and a shirt around his shoulders he stepped from the bath to join the nobles at their wine and there stood nausicaa as he passed beside a column that propped the sturdy roof she paused endowed by the gods with all her beauty gazing at odysseus right before her eyes wonderstruck she hailed her guest with a winning ﬂight of words “farewell my friend and when you are at home home in your own land remember me at times mainly to me you owe the gift of life” odysseus rose to the moment deftly gently “nausicaa daughter of generous king alcinous may zeus the thunderer hera’s husband grant it so— that i travel home and see the dawn of my return even at home i’ll pray to you as a deathless goddess all my days to come y ou saved my life dear girl” and he went and took his seat beside the king by now they were serving out the portions mixing wine and the herald soon approached leading the faithful bard demodocus prized by all the people—seated him in a chair amid the feasters leaning it against a central column at once alert odysseus carved a strip of loin rich and crisp with fat from the whitetusked boar that still had much meat left and called the herald over “here herald take this choice cut to demodocus so he can eat his ﬁll—with warm regards from a man who knows what suffering is … from all who walk the earth our bards deserve esteem and awe for the muse herself has taught them paths of song she loves the breed of harpers” the herald placed the gift in demodocus’ hands and the famous blind bard received it overjoyed they reached for the good things that lay outspread and when they’d put aside desire for food and drink odysseus master of many exploits praised the singer “i respect you demodocus more than any man alive— surely the muse has taught you zeus’s daughter or god apollo himself how true to life all too true … you sing the achaeans’ fate all they did and suffered all they soldiered through as if you were there yourself or heard from one who was but come now shift your ground sing of the wooden horse epeus built with athena’s help the cunning trap that good odysseus brought one day to the heights of troy ﬁlled with ﬁghting men who laid the city waste sing that for me—true to life as it deserves— and i will tell the world at once how freely the muse gave you the gods’ own gift of song” stirred now by the muse the bard launched out in a ﬁne blaze of song starting at just the point where the main achaean force setting their camps aﬁre had boarded the oarswept ships and sailed for home but famed odysseus’ men already crouched in hiding— in the heart of troy’s assembly—dark in that horse the trojans dragged themselves to the city heights now it stood there looming … and round its bulk the trojans sat debating clashing days on end thre e plans split their ranks either to hack open the hollow vault with ruthless bronze or haul it up to the highest ri dge and pitch it down the cliffs or let it stand—a glorious offering made to pacify the gods— and that that ﬁnal plan was bound to win the day for troy was fated to perish once the city lodged inside her walls the monstrous wooden horse where the prime of argive power lay in wait with death and slaughter bearing down on troy and he sang how troops of achaeans broke from cover streaming out of the horse’s hollow ﬂanks to plunder troy— he sang how left and right they ravaged the steep city sang how odysseus marched right up to deiphobus’ house like the god of war on attack with diehard menelaus there he sang odysseus fought the grimmest ﬁght he had ever braved but he won through at last thanks to athena’s superhuman power that was the song the famous harper sang but great odysseus melted into tears running down from his eyes to wet his cheeks … as a woman weeps her arms ﬂu ng round her darling husband a man who fell in battle ﬁghting for town and townsmen trying to beat the day of doom from home and children seeing the man go down dying gasping for breath she clings for dear life screams and shrills— but the victors just behind her digging spearbutts into her back and shoulders drag her off in bondage yoked to hard labor pain and the most heartbreaking torment wastes her cheeks so from odysseus’ eyes ran tears of heartbreak now but his weeping went unmarked by all the others only alcinous sitting close beside him noticed his guest’s tears heard the groan in the man’s labored breathing and said at once to the master mariners around him “hear me my lords and captains of phaeacia let demodocus rest his ringing lyre now— this song he sings can hardly please us all ever since our meal began and the stirring bard launched his song our guest has never paused in his tears and throbbing sorrow clearly grief has overpowered his heart break off this song let us all enjoy ourselves the hosts and guest together much the warmer way all these things are performed for him our honored guest the royal sendoff here and gifts we give in love treat your guest and suppliant like a brother anyone with a touch of sense knows that so don’t be crafty now my friend don’t hide the truth i’m after fair is fair speak out come tell us the name they call you there at home— your mother father townsmen neighbors round about surely no man in the world is nameless all told born high born low as soon as he sees the light his parents always name him once he’s born and tell me your land your people your city too so our ships can sail you home—their wits will speed them there for we have no steersmen here among phaeacia’s crews or steeringoars that guide your common craft our ships know in a ﬂash their mates’ intentions know all ports of call and all the rich green ﬁelds with wings of the wind they cross the sea’s huge gulfs shrouded in mist and cloud—no fear in the world of foundering fatal shipwreck true there’s an old tale i heard my father telling once nausithous used to say that lord poseidon was vexed with us because we escorted all mankind and never came to grief he said that one day as a wellbuilt ship of ours sailed home on the misty sea from such a convoy the god would crush it yes and pile a huge mountain round about our port so the old king foretold … and as for the god well he can do his worst or leave it quite undone whatever warms his heart but come my friend tell us your own story now and tell it truly where have your rovings forced you what lands of men have you seen what sturdy towns what men themselves who we re wild savage lawless who were friendly to strangers godfearing men tell me why do you weep and grieve so sorely when you hear the fate of the argives hear the fall of troy that is the gods’ work spinning threads of death through the lives of mortal men and all to make a song for those to come … did one of your kinsmen die before the walls of troy some brave man—a son by marriage father by marriage next to our own blood kin our nearest dearest ties or a friend perhaps someone close to your heart staunch and loyal no less dear than a brother the brotherinarms who shares our inmost thoughts” book ix in the oneeyed giant’s cave odysseus the great teller of tale s launched out on his story “a l c i n o u s m a j e s t y s h i n i n g a m o n g y o u r i s l a n d p e o p l e what a ﬁne thing it is to listen to such a bard as we have here—the man sings like a god the crown of life i’d say there’s nothing better than when deep joy holds sway throughout the realm and banqueters up and down the palace sit in ranks enthralled to hear the bard and before them all the tables heaped with bread and meats and drawing wine from a mixingbowl the steward makes his rounds and keeps the winecups ﬂowing this to my mind is the best that life can offer but now you’re set on probing the bitter pains i’ve borne so i’m to weep and grieve it seems still more well then what shall i go through ﬁrst what shall i save for last what pains—the gods have given me my share now let me begin by telling you my name … so you may know it well and i in times to come if i can escape the fatal day will be your host your sworn friend though my home is far from here i am odysseus son of laertes known to the world for every kind of craft—my fame has reached the skies sunny ithaca is my home atop her stands our seamark mount neriton’s leafy ridges shimmering in the wind around her a ring of islands circle sidebyside dulichion same wooded zacynthus too but mine lies low and away the farthest out to sea rearing into the western dusk while the others face the east and breaking day mine is a rugged land but good for raising sons— and i myself i know no sweeter sight on earth than a man’s own native country true enough calypso the lustrous goddess tried to hold me back deep in her arching caverns craving me for a husband so did circe holding me ju st as warmly in her halls the bewitching queen of aeaea keen to have me too but they never won the heart inside me never so nothing is as sweet as a man’s own country his own parents even though he’s settled down in some luxurious house off in a foreign land and far from those who bore him no more come let me tell you about the voyage fraught with hardship zeus inﬂicted on me homeward bound from troy … the wind drove me out of ilium on to ismarus the cicones’ stronghold there i sacked the city killed the men but as for the wives and plunder that rich haul we dragged away from the place— we shared it round so no one not on my account would go deprived of his fair share of spoils then i urged them to cut and run set sail but would they listen not those mutinous fools there was too much wine to swill too many sheep to slaughter down along the beach and shambling longhorn cattle and all the while the cicones sought out other cicones called for help from their neighbors living inland a larger force and stronger soldiers too skilled hands at ﬁghting men from chariots skilled when a crisis broke to ﬁght on foot out of the morning mist they came against us— packed as the leaves and spears that ﬂower forth in spring— and zeus presented us with di saster me and my comrades doomed to suffer blow on mortal blow lining up both armies battled it out against our swift ships both raked each other with hurtling bronze lances long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger we stood and fought them off massed as they were but then when the sun wheeled past the hour for unyoking oxen the cicones broke our lines and beat us down at last out of each ship six menatarms were killed the rest of us rowed away from certain doom from there we sailed on glad to escape our death yet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost but i would not let our rolling ships set sail until the crews had raised the triple cry saluting each poor comrade cut down by the ﬁerce cicones on that plain now zeus who masses the stormclouds hit the ﬂeet with the north wind— a howling demonic gale shrouding over in thunderheads the earth and sea at once— and night swept down from the sky and the ships went plunging headlong on our sails slashed to rags by the hurricane’s blast we struck them—cringing at death we rowed our ships to the nearest shoreline pulled with all our power there for two nights two days we lay by no letup eating our hearts out bent with pain and bonetired when dawn with her lovely lo cks brought on the third day then stepping the masts and hoisting white sails high we lounged at the oarlocks letting wind and helmsmen keep us true on course … and now at long last i might have reached my native land unscathed but just as i doubled malea’s cape a tiderip and the north wind drove me way off course careering past cythera nine whole days i was borne along by rough deadly winds on the ﬁshinfested sea then on the tenth our squadron reached the land of the lotuseaters people who eat the lotus mellow fruit and ﬂower we disembarked on the coast drew water there and crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships once we’d had our ﬁll of food and drink i sent a detail ahead two picked men and a third a runner to scout out who might live there—men like us perhaps who live on bread so off they went and soon enough they mingled among the natives lotuseaters lotuseaters who had no notion of killing my companions not at all they simply gave them the lotus to taste instead … any crewmen who ate the lotus the honeysweet fruit lost all desire to send a message back much less return their only wish to linger there with the lotuseaters grazing on lotus all memory of the journey home dissolved forever but i brought them back back to the hollow ships and streaming tears—i forced them hauled them under the rowing benches lashed them fast and shouted out commands to my other steady comrades ‘quick no time to lose embark in the racing ships’— so none could eat the lotus forget the voyage home they swung aboard at once they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke from there we sailed on our spirits now at a low ebb and reached the land of the high and mighty cyclops lawless brutes who trust so to the everlasting gods they never plant with their own hands or plow the soil unsown unplowed the earth teems with all they need wheat barley and vines swelled by the rains of zeus to yield a big fullbodied wine from clustered grapes they have no meeting place for council no laws either no up on the mountain peaks they live in arching caverns— each a law to himself ruling his wives and children not a care in the world for any neighbor now a level island stretches ﬂat across the harbor not close inshore to the cyclops’ coast not too far out thick with woods where the w ild goats breed by hundreds no trampling of men to start them from their lairs no hunters roughing it out on the woody ridges stalking quarry ever raid their haven no ﬂocks browse no plowlands roll with wheat unplowed unsown forever—empty of humankind— the island just feeds droves of bleating goats for the cyclops have no ships with crimson prows no shipwrights there to build them good trim craft that could sail them out to foreign ports of call as most men risk the seas to trade with other men such artisans would have made this island too a decent place to live in … no mean spot it could bear you any crop you like in season the watermeadows along the low foaming shore run soft and moist and your vines would never ﬂag the land’s clear for plowing harvest on harvest a man could reap a healthy stand of grain— the subsoil’s dark and rich there’s a snug deepwater harbor there what’s more no need for mooringgear no anchorstones to heave no cables to make fast just beach your keels ride out the days till your shipmates’ spirit stirs for open sea and a fair wind blows and last at the harbor’s head there’s a spring that rushes fresh from beneath a cave and black poplars ﬂourish round its mouth well here we landed and surely a god steered us in through the pitchblack night not that he ever showed himself with thick fog swirling around the ships the moon wrapped in clouds and not a glimmer stealing through that gloom not one of us glimpsed the island—scanning hard— or the long combers rolling us slowly toward the coast not till our ships had run their keels ashore beaching our vessels smoothly striking sail the crews swung out on the low shelving sand and there we fell asleep awaiting dawn’s ﬁrst light when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more we all turned out intrigued to tour the island the local nymphs the daughters of zeus himself ﬂushed mountaingoats so the crews could make their meal quickly we fetched our curved bows and hunting spears from the ships and splitting up into three bands we started shooting and soon enough some god had sent us bags of ga me to warm our hearts a dozen vessels sailed in my command and to each crew nine goats were shared out and mine alone took ten then all day long till the sun went down we sat and feasted well on sides of meat and rounds of heady wine the good red stock in our vessels’ holds had not run out there was still plenty left the men had carried off a generous store in jars when we stormed and sacked the cicones’ holy city now we stared across at the cyclops’ shore so near we could even see their smoke hear their voices their bleating sheep and goats … and then when the sun had set and night came on we lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more i called a muster briskly commanding all the hands ‘the rest of you stay here my friendsinarms i’ll go across with my own ship and crew and probe the natives living over there what are they—violent savage lawless or friendly to strangers godfearing men’ with that i boarded ship and told the crew to embark at once and cast off cables quickly they swung aboard they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke but as soon as we reached the coast i mentioned—no long trip— we spied a cavern just at the shore gaping above the surf towering overgrown with laurel and here big ﬂocks sheep and goats were stalled to spend the nights and around its mouth a yard was walled up with quarried boulders sunk deep in the earth and enormous pines and oaktrees looming darkly … here was a giant’s lair in fact who always pastured his sheepﬂocks far aﬁeld and never mixed with others a grim loner dead set in his own lawless ways here was a piece of work by god a monster built like no mortal who ever supped on bread no like a shaggy peak i’d say—a manmountain rearing head and shoulders over the world now then i told most of my good trusty crew to wait to sit tight by the ship and guard her well while i picked out my dozen ﬁnest ﬁghters and off i went but i took a skin of wine along the ruddy irresistible wine that maron gave me once euanthes’ son a priest of apollo lord of ismarus because we’d rescued him his wife and children reverent as we were he lived you see in apollo’s holy grove and so in return he gave me splendid gifts he handed me seven bars of wellwrought gold a mixingbowl of solid silver then this wine … he drew it off in generous winejars twelve in all all unmixed—and such a bouquet a drink ﬁt for the gods no maid or man of his household knew that secret store only himself his loving wife and a single servant whenever they’d drink the deepred mellow vintage twenty cups of water he’d stir in one of wine and what an aroma wafted from the bowl— what magic what a godsend— no joy in holding back when that was poured filling a great goatskin now i took this wine provisions too in a leather sack a sudden foreboding told my righting spirit i’d soon come up against some giant clad in power like armorplate— a savage deaf to justice blind to law our party quickly made its way to his cave but we failed to ﬁnd our host himself inside he was off in his pasture ranging his sleek ﬂocks so we explored his den gazing wideeyed at it all the large ﬂat racks loaded with drying cheeses the folds crowded with young lambs and kids split into three groups—here the springborn here midyearlings here the fresh sucklings off to the side—each sort was penned apart and all his vessels pa ils and hammered buckets he used for milking were brimming full with whey from the start my comrades pressed me pleading hard ‘let’s make away with the cheeses then come back— hurry drive the lambs and kids from the pens to our swift ship put out to sea at once’ but i would not give way— and how much better it would have been— not till i saw him saw what gifts he’d give but he proved no lovely sight to my companions there we built a ﬁre set our hands on the cheeses offered some to the gods and ate the bulk ourselves and settled down inside awaiting his return … and back he came from pasture late in the day herding his ﬂocks home and lugging a huge load of good dry logs to fuel his ﬁre at supper he ﬂung them down in the cave—a jolting crash— we scuttled in panic into the deepest dark recess and next he drove his sleek ﬂocks into the open vault all he’d milk at least but he left the males outside rams and billy goats out in the highwalled yard then to close his door he hoisted overhead a tremendous massive slab— no twentytwo wagons rugged and fourwheeled could budge that boulder off the ground i tell you such an immense stone the monster wedged to block his cave then down he squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats each in order and put a suckling underneath each dam and half of the fresh white milk he curdled quickly set it aside in wicker ra cks to press for cheese the other half let stand in pails and buckets ready at hand to wash his supper down as soon as he’d briskl y ﬁnished all his chores he lit his ﬁre and spied us in the blaze and ‘strangers’ he thundered out ‘now who are you where did you sail from over the running sealanes out on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates seawolves raiding at will who risk their lives to plunder other men’ the hearts inside us shook terriﬁed by his rumbling voice and monstrous hulk nevertheless i found the nerve to answer ﬁrmly ‘men of achaea we are and bound now from troy driven far off course by the warring winds over the vast gulf of the sea—battling home on a strange tack a route that’s off the map and so we’ve come to you … so it must please king zeus’s plotting heart we’re glad to say we’re men of atrides agamemnon whose fame is the proudest thing on earth these days so great a city he sacked such multitudes he killed but since we’ve chanced on you we’re at your knees in hopes of a warm welcome even a guestgift the sort that hosts give strangers that’s the custom respect the gods my friend we’re suppliants—at your mercy zeus of the strangers guards all guests and suppliants strangers are sacred—zeus will avenge their rights’ ‘stranger’ he grumbled back from his brutal heart ‘you must be a fool stranger or come from nowhere telling me to fear the gods or avoid their wrath we cyclops never blink at zeus and zeus’s shield of storm and thunder or any other blessed god— we’ve got more force by far i’d never spare you in fear of zeus’s hatred you or your comrades here unless i had the urge but tell me where did you moor your sturdy ship when you arrived up the coast or close in i’d just like to know’ so he laid his trap but he never caught me no wise to the world i shot back in my crafty way ‘my ship poseidon god of the earthquake smashed my ship he drove it against the rocks at your island’s far cape dashed it against a cliff as the winds rode us in i and the men you see escaped a sudden death’ not a word in reply to that the ruthless brute lurching up he lunged out with his hands toward my men and snatching two at once rapping them on the ground he knocked them dead like pups— their brains gushed out all over soaked the ﬂoor— and ripping them limb from limb to ﬁx his meal he bolted them down like a mountainlion left no scrap devoured entrails ﬂesh and bones marrow and all we ﬂung our arms to zeus we wept and cried aloud looking on at his grisly work—paralyzed appalled but once the cyclops had stuffed his enormous gut with human ﬂesh washing it down with raw milk he slept in his cave stretched out along his ﬂocks and i with my ﬁghting heart i thought at ﬁrst to steal up to him draw the sharp sword at my hip and stab his chest where the midriff packs the liver— i groped for the fatal spot but a fresh thought held me back there at a stroke we’d ﬁnish off ourselves as well— how could we with our bare hands heave back that slab he set to block his cavern’s gaping maw so we lay there groaning waiting dawn’s ﬁrst light when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more the monster relit his ﬁre and milked his handsome ewes each in order putting a suckling underneath each dam and as soon as he’d briskly ﬁnished all his chores he snatched up two more men and ﬁxed his meal wellfed he drove his fat sheep from the cave lightly lifting the huge doorslab up and away then slipped it back in place as a hunter ﬂips the lid of his quiver shut piercing whistles—turning his ﬂocks to the hills he left me there the heart inside me brooding on revenge how could i pay him back would athena give me glory here was the plan that struck my mind as best … the cyclops’ great club there it lay by the pens olivewood full of sap he’d lopped it off to brandish once it dried looking it over we judged it big enough to be the mast of a pitchblack ship with her twenty oars a freighter broad in the beam that plows through miles of sea— so long so thick it bulked before our eyes well ﬂanking it now i chopped off a fathom’s length pushed it to comrades told them to plane it down and they made the club smooth as i bent and shaved the tip to a stabbing point i turned it over the blazing ﬁre to char it good and hard then hid it well buried deep under the dung that littered the cavern’s ﬂoor in thick wet clumps and now i ordered my shipmates all to cast lots— who’d brave it out with me to hoist our stake and grind it into his eye when sleep had overcome him luck of the draw i got the very ones i would have picked myself four good men and i in the lead made ﬁve … nightfall brought him back herding his woolly sheep and he quickly drove the sleek ﬂock into the vaulted cavern rams and all—none left outside in the walled yard— his own idea perhaps or a god led him on then he hoisted the huge slab to block the door and squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats each in order putting a suckling underneath each dam and as soon as he’d briskly ﬁnished all his chores he snatched up two more men and ﬁxed his meal but this time i lifted a carved wooden bowl brimful of my ruddy wine and went right up to the cyclops enticing ‘here cyclops try this wine—to top off the banquet of human ﬂesh you’ve bolted down judge for yourself what stock our ship had stored i brought it here to make you a ﬁne libation hoping you would pity me cyclops send me home but your rages are insufferable y ou barbarian— how can any man on earth come visit you after this what you’ve done outrages all that’s right’ at that he seized the bowl and tossed it off and the heady wine pleased him immensely ‘more’— he demanded a second bowl—’a hearty helping and tell me your name now quickly so i can hand my guest a gift to warm his heart our soil yields the cyclops powerful fullbodied wine and the rains from zeus build its strength but this this is nectar ambrosia—this ﬂows from heaven’ so he declared i poured him another ﬁery bowl— three bowls i brimmed and three he drank to the last drop the fool and then when the wine was swirling round his brain i approached my host with a cordial winning word ‘so you ask me the name i’m known by cyclops i will tell you but you must give me a guestgift as you’ve promised nobody—that’s my name nobody— so my mother and father call me all my friends’ but he boomed back at me from his ruthless heart ‘nobody i’ll eat nobody last of all his friends— i’ll eat the others ﬁrst that’s my gift to you’ with that he toppled over sprawled fulllength ﬂat on his back and lay there his massive neck slumping to one side and sleep that conquers all overwhelmed him now as wine came spurting ﬂooding up from his gullet with chunks of human ﬂesh—he vomited blind drunk now at last i thrust our stake in a bed of embers to get it redhot and rallied all my comrades ‘courage—no panic no one hang back now’ and green as it was just as the olive stake was about to catch ﬁre—the glow terriﬁc yes— i dragged it from the ﬂames my men clustering round as some god breathed enormous courage through us all hoisting high that olive stake with its stabbing point straight into the monster’s eye they rammed it hard— i drove my weight on it from above and bored it home as a shipwright bores his beam with a shipwright’s drill that men below whipping the strap back and forth whirl and the drill keeps twisting faster never stopping— so we seized our stake with its ﬁery tip and bored it round and round in the giant’s eye till blood came boiling up around that smoking shaft and the hot blast singed his brow and eyelids round the core and the broiling eyeball burst— its crackling roots blazed and hissed— as a blacksmith plunges a glowing ax or adze in an icecold bath and the metal screeches steam and its temper hardens—that’s the iron’s strength— so the eye of the cyclops sizzled round that stake he loosed a hideous roar the rock walls echoed round and we scuttled back in terror the monster wrenched the spike from his eye and out it came with a red geyser of blood— he ﬂung it aside with frantic hands and mad with pain he bellowed out for help from his neighbor cyclops living round about in caves on windswept crags hearing his cries they lumbered up from every side and hulking round his cavern asked what ailed him ‘what polyphemus what in the world’s the trouble roaring out in the godsent night to rob us of our sleep surely no one’s rustling your ﬂocks against your will— surely no one’s trying to kill you now by fraud or force’ ‘nobody friends’—polyphemus bellowed back from his cave— ‘nobody’s killing me now by fraud and not by force’‘ ‘if you’re alone’ his friends boomed back at once ‘and nobody’s trying to overpower you now—look it must be a plague sent here by mighty zeus and there’s no escape from that yo u ’ d b e t t e r p r a y t o y o u r f a t h e r l o r d p o s e i d o n ’ they lumbered off but laughter ﬁlled my heart to think how nobody’s name—my great cunning stroke— had duped them one and all but the cyclops there still groaning racked with agony groped around for the huge slab and heaving it from the doorway down he sat in the cave’s mouth his arms spread wide hoping to catch a comrade stealing out with sheep— such a blithering fool he took me for but i was already plotting … what was the best way out how could i ﬁnd escape from death for my crew myself as well my wits kept weaving weaving cunning schemes— life at stake monstrous death staring us in the face— till this plan struck my mind as best that ﬂock those wellfed rams with their splendid thick ﬂeece sturdy handsome beasts sporting their dark weight of wool i lashed them abreast quietly twisting the willowtwigs the cyclops slept on—giant lawless brute—i took them three by three each ram in the middle bore a man while the two rams either side would shield him well so three beasts to bear each man but as for myself there was one bellwether ram the prize of all the ﬂock and clutching him by his back tucked up under his shaggy belly there i hung face upward both hands locked in his marvelous deep ﬂeece clinging for dear life my spirit steeled enduring … so we held on desperate waiting dawn’s ﬁrst light as soon as young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more the rams went rumbling out of the cave toward pasture the ewes kept bleating round the pens unmilked their udders about to burst their master now heaving in torment felt the back of each animal halting before him here but the idiot never sensed my men were trussed up under their thick ﬂeecy ribs and last of them all came my great ram now striding out weighed down with his dense wool and my deep plots stroking him gently powerful polyphemus murmured ‘dear old ram why last of the ﬂock to quit the cave in the good old days you’d never lag behind the rest— you with your long marching strides ﬁrst by far of the ﬂock to graze the fresh young grasses ﬁrst by far to reach the rippling streams ﬁrst to turn back home keen for your fold when night comes on—but now you’re last of all and why sick at heart for your master’s eye that coward gouged out with his wicked crew— only after he’d stunned my wits with wine— that that nobody … who’s not escaped his death i swear not yet oh if only you thought like me had words like me to tell me where that scoundrel is cringing from my rage i’d smash him against the ground i’d spill his brains— ﬂooding across my cave—and that would ease my heart of the pains that goodfornothing nobody made me suffer’ and with that threat he let my ram go free outside but soon as we’d got one foot past cave and courtyard ﬁrst i loosed myself from the ram then loosed my men then quickly glancing back again and again we drove our ﬂock good plump beasts with their long sharks straight to the ship and a welcome sight we were to loyal comrades—we who’d escaped our deaths— but for all the rest they broke down and wailed i cut it short i stopped each shipmate’s cries my head tossing brows frowning silent signals to hurry tumble our ﬂeecy herd on board launch out on the open sea they swung aboard they sat to the oars in rank and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke but once offshore as far as a man’s shout can carry i called back to the cyclops stinging taunts ‘so cyclops no weak coward it was whose crew you bent to devour there in your vaulted cave— you with your brute force y our ﬁlthy crimes came down on your own head you shameless cannibal daring to eat your guests in your own house— so zeus and the other gods have paid you back’ that made the rage of the monster boil over ripping off the peak of a towering crag he heaved it so hard the boulder landed just in front of our dark prow and a huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under— a tidal wave from the open sea the sudden backwash drove us landward again forcing us close inshore but grabbing a long pole i thrust us off and away tossing my head for dear life signaling crews to put their backs in the oars escape grim death they threw themselves in the labor rowed on fast but once we’d plowed the breakers twice as far again i began to taunt the cyclops—men around me trying to check me calm me left and right ‘so headstrong—why why rile the beast again’ ‘that rock he ﬂung in the sea just now hurling our ship to shore once more—we thought we’d die on the spot’ ‘if he’d caught a sound from one of us just a whisper he would have crushed our heads and ship timbers with one heave of another ﬂashing jagged rock’ ‘good god the brute can throw’ so they begged but they could not bring my ﬁghting spirit round i called back with another burst of anger ‘cyclops— if any man on the face of the earth should ask you who blinded you shamed you so—say odysseus raider of cities he gouged out your eye laertes’ son who makes his home in ithaca’ so i vaunted and he groaned back in answer ‘oh no no—that prophecy years ago … it all comes home to me with a vengeance now we once had a prophet here a great tall man telemus eurymus’ son a master at reading signs who grew old in his trade among his fellowcyclops all this he warned me would come to pass someday— that i’d be blinded here at the hands of one odysseus but i always looked for a handsome giant man to cross my path some ﬁghter clad in power like armorplate but now look what a dwarf a spineless goodfornothing stuns me with wine then gouges out my eye come here odysseus let me give you a guestgift and urge poseidon the earthquake god to speed you home i am his son and he claims to be my father true and he himself will heal me if he pleases— no other blessed god no man can do the work’ ‘heal you’— here was my parting shot—’would to god i could strip you of life and breath and ship you down to the house of death as surely as no one will ever heal your eye not even your earthquake god himself’ but at that he bellowed out to lord poseidon thrusting his arms to the starry skies and prayed ‘hear me— poseidon god of the seablue mane who rocks the earth if i really am your son and you claim to be my father— come grant that odysseus raider of cities laertes’ son who makes his home in ithaca never reaches home or if he’s fated to see his people once again and reach his wellbuilt house and his own native country let him come home late and come a broken man—all shipmates lost alone in a stranger’s ship— and let him ﬁnd a world of pain at home’ so he prayed and the god of the seablue mane poseidon heard his prayer the monster suddenly hoisted a boulder—far larger— wheeled and heaved it putting his weight behind it massive strength and the boulder crashed close landing just in the wake of our dark stern just failing to graze the rudder’s bladed edge a huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under yes and the tidal breaker drove us out to our island’s far shore where all my welldecked ships lay moored clustered waiting and huddled round them crewmen sat in anguish waiting chaﬁng for our return we beached our vessel hard ashore on the sand we swung out in the frothing surf ourselves and herding cyclops’ sheep from our deep holds we shared them round so no one not on my account would go deprived of his fair share of spoils but the splendid ram—as we meted out the ﬂocks my friendsinarms made him my prize of honor mine alone and i slaughtered him on the beach and burnt his thighs to cronus’ mighty son zeus of the thundercloud who rules the world but my sacriﬁces failed to move the god zeus was still obsessed with plans to destroy my entire oarswept ﬂeet and loyal crew of comrades now all day long till the sun went down we sat and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine then when the sun had set and night came on we lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more i roused the men straightway ordering all crews to man the ships and cast off cables quickly they swung aboard at once they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke and from there we sailed on glad to escape our death yet sick at heart for the comrades we had lost” book x the bewitching queen of aeaea “we reached the aeolian island next the home of aeolus hippotas’ son beloved by the gods who never die— a great ﬂoating island it was and round it all huge ramparts rise of indestructible bronze and sheer rock cliffs shoot up from sea to sky the king had sired twelve children within his halls six daughters and six sons in the lusty prime of youth so he gave his daughters as wives to his six sons seated beside their dear father and doting mother with delicacies aplenty spread before them they feast on forever … all day long the halls breathe the savor of roasted meats and echo round to the low moan of blowing pipes and all night long each one by his faithful mate they sleep under softpiled rugs on corded bedsteads to this city of theirs we came their splendid palace and aeolus hosted me one entire month he pressed me for news of troy and the argive ships and how we sailed for home and i told him the whole long story ﬁrst to last and then when i begged him to send me on my way he denied me nothing he went about my passage he gave me a sack the skin of a fullgrown ox binding inside the winds that howl from every quarter for zeus had made that king the master of all the winds with power to calm them down or rouse them as he pleased aeolus stowed the sack inside my holds lashed so fast with a burnished silver cord not even a slight puff could slip past that knot ye t h e s e t t h e we s t w i n d f r e e t o b l o w u s o n o u r w a y and waft our squadron home bu t his plan was bound to fail yes our own reckless folly swept us on to ruin … nine whole days we sailed nine nights nonstop on the tenth our own land hove into sight at last— we were so close we could see men tending ﬁres but now an enticing sleep came on me boneweary from working the vessel’s sheet myself no letup never trusting the ropes to any other mate the faster to journey back to native land but the crews began to mutter among themselves sure i was hauling troves of gold and silver home the gifts of openhearted aeolus hippotas’ son ‘the old story’ one man glanced at another grumbling ‘look at our captain’s luck—so loved by the world so prized at every landfall every port of call’ ‘heaps of lovely plunder he hauls home from troy while we who went through slogging just as hard we go home emptyhanded’ ‘now this aeolus loads him down with treasure favoritism friend to friend’ ‘hurry let’s see what loot is in that sack how much gold and silver break it open—now’ a fatal plan but it won my shipmates over they loosed the sack and all the winds burst out and a sudden squall struck and swept us back to sea wailing in tears far from our own native land and i woke up with a start my spirit churning— should i leap over the side and drown at once or grin and bear it stay among the living i bore it all held ﬁrm hiding my face clinging tight to the decks while heavy squalls blasted our squadron back again to aeolus’ island shipmates groaning hard we disembarked on the coast drew water there and crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships once we’d had our ﬁll of food and drink i took a shipmate along with me a herald too and approached king aeolus’ famous halls and here we found him feasting beside his wife and many children reaching the doorposts at the threshold down we sat but our hosts amazed to see us only shouted questions ‘back again odysseus—why some blustering god attacked you surely we launched you well we sped you on your way to your own land and house or any place you pleased’ so they taunted and i replied in deep despair ‘a m u t i n o u s c r e w u n d i d m e — t h a t a n d a c r u e l s l e e p set it to rights my friends y ou have the power’ so i pleaded—gentle humble appeals— but our hosts turned silent hushed … and the father broke forth with an ultimatum ‘aw a y f r o m m y i s l a n d — f a s t — m o s t c u r s e d m a n a l i v e it’s a crime to host a man or speed him on his way when the blessed deathless gods despise him so crawling back like this — it proves the immortals hate you out—get out’ groan as i did his curses drove me from his halls and from there we pulled away with heavy hearts with the crews’ spirit broken under the oars’ labor thanks to our own folly … no favoring wind in sight six whole days we rowed six nights nonstop on the seventh day we raised the laestrygonian land telepylus heights where the craggy fort of lamus rises where shepherd calls to shepherd as one drives in his ﬂocks and the other drives his out and he calls back in answer where a man who never sleeps could rake in double wages one for herding cattle one for pasturing ﬂeecy sheep the nightfall and the sunrise march so close together we entered a ﬁne harbor there all walled around by a great unbroken sweep of skyscraping cliff and two steep headlands fronting each other close around the mouth so the passage in is cramped here the rest of my rolling squadron steered right into the gaping cove and moored tightly prow by prow never a swell there big or small a milkwhite calm spreads all around the place but i alone anchored my black ship outside well clear of the harbor’s jaws i tied her fast to a cliff side with a cable i scaled its rock face to a lookout on its crest but glimpsed no trace of the work of man or beast from there all i spied was a plume of smoke drifting off the land so i sent some crew ahead to learn who lived there— men like us perhaps who live on bread two good mates i chose and a third to run the news they disembarked and set out on a beaten trail the wagons used for hauling timber down to town from the mountain heights above … and before the walls they met a girl drawing water antiphates’ strapping daughter—king of the laestrygonians she’d come down to a clear running spring artacia where the local people came to ﬁll their pails my shipmates clustered roun d her asking questions who was king of the realm who ruled the natives here she waved at once to her father’s highroofed halls they entered the sumptuous palace found his wife inside— a woman huge as a mountain crag wh o ﬁlled them all with horror straightaway she summoned royal antiphates from assembly her husband who prepared my crew a barbarous welcome snatching one of my men he tore him up for dinner— the other two sprang free and reached the ships but the king let loose a howling through the town that brought tremendous laestrygonians swarming up from every side—hundreds not like men like giants’ down from the cliffs they ﬂung great rocks a man could hardly hoist and a ghastly shattering din rose up from all the ships— men in their deathcries hulls smashed to splinters— they speared the crews like ﬁsh and whisked them home to make their grisly meal but while they killed them off in the harbor depths i pulled the sword from beside my hip and hacked away at the ropes that moored my blueprowed ship of war and shouted rapid orders at my shipmates ‘put your backs in the oars—now row or die’ in terror of death they ripped the swells—all as one— and what a joy as we darted out toward open sea clear of those beetling cliffs … my ship alone but the rest went down en masse our squadron sank from there we sailed on glad to escape our death yet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost we reached the aeaean island next the home of circe the nymph with lovely braids an awesome power too who can speak with human voice the true sister of murderousminded aeetes both were bred by the sun who lights our lives their mother was perse a child the ocean bore we brought our ship to port without a sound as a god eased her into a harbor safe and snug and for two days and two nights we lay by there eating our hearts out bent with pain and bonetired when dawn with her lovely lo cks brought on the third day at last i took my spear and my sharp sword again rushed up from the ship to ﬁnd a lookout point hoping to glimpse some sign of human labor catch some human voices … i scaled a commanding crag and scanning hard i could just make out some smoke from circe’s halls drifting up from the broad terrain through brush and woods mulling it over i though t i’d scout the ground— that ﬁre aglow in the smoke i saw it true but soon enough this seemed the better plan i’d go back to shore and the swift ship ﬁrst feed the men then send them out for scouting i was well on my way down nearing our ship when a god took pity on me wandering all alone he sent me a big stag with high branching antlers right across my path—the sun’s heat forced him down from his forest range to drink at a river’s banks— just bounding out of the timber when i hit him square in the backbone halfway down the spine and my bronze spear went punching clean through— he dropped in the dust groaning gasping out his breath treading on him i wrenched my bronze spear from the wound left it there on the ground and snapping off some twigs and creepers twisted a rope about a fathom long i braided it tight hand over hand then lashed the four hocks of that magniﬁcent beast loaded round my neck i lugged him toward the ship trudging propped on my spear—no way to sling him over a shoulder steadyin g him with one free arm— the kill was so immense i ﬂung him down by the hull and roused the men going up to them all with a word to lift their spirits ‘listen to me my comrades brothers in hardship— we won’t go down to the house of death not yet not till our day arrives up with you look there’s still some meat and drink in our good ship put our minds on food—why die of hunger here’ my hardy urging brought them round at once heads came up from cloaks and there by the barren sea they gazed at the stag thei r eyes wide—my noble trophy but once they’d looked their ﬁll and warmed their hearts they washed their hands and prepared a splendid meal now all day long till the sun went down we sat and feasted on sides of meat and seasoned wine then when the sun had set and night came on we lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more i called a muster quickly informing all the crew ‘listen to me my comrades brothers in hardship we can’t tell east from west the dawn from the dusk nor where the sun that lights our lives goes under earth nor where it rises we must think of a plan at once some cunning stroke i doubt there’s one still left i scaled a commanding crag and from that height surveyed an entire island ringed like a crown by endless wastes of sea but the land itself lies low and i did see smoke drifting up from its heart through thick brush and woods’ my message broke their spirit as they recalled the gruesome work of the laestrygonian king antiphates and the hearty cannibal cyclops thirsting for our blood they burst into cries wailing streaming live tears that gained us nothing—what good can come of grief and so numbering off my band of menatarms into two platoons i assigned them each a leader i took one and lord eurylochus the other we quickly shook lots in a bronze helmet— the lot of brave eurylochus leapt out ﬁrst so he moved off with his two and twenty comrades weeping leaving us behind in tears as well … deep in the wooded glens they came on circe’s palace built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land mountain wolves and lions were roaming round the grounds— she’d bewitched them herself she gave them magic drugs but they wouldn’t attack my men they just came pawing up around them fawning swishing thei r long tails— eager as hounds that fawn around their master coming home from a feast who always brings back scraps to calm them down so they came nuzzling round my men—lions wolves with big powerful claws—and the men cringed in fear at sight of those strange ferocious beasts … but still they paused at her doors the nymph with lovely braids circe—and deep inside they heard her singing lifting her spellbinding voice as she glided back and forth at her great immortal loom her enchanting web a shimmering glory only goddesses can weave polites captain of armies took command the closest most devoted man i had ‘friends there’s someone inside plying a great loom and how she sings—enthralling the whole house is echoing to her song goddess or woman—let’s call out to her now’ so he urged and the men called out and hailed her she opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth inviting them all in and in they went all innocence only eurylochus stayed behind—he sensed a trap … she ushered them in to sit on highbacked chairs then she mixed them a potion—cheese barley and pale honey mulled in pramnian wine— but into the brew she stirred her wicked drugs to wipe from their memories any thought of home once they’d drained the bowls she ﬁlled suddenly she struck with her wand drove them into her pigsties all of them bristling into swine—with grunts snouts—even their bodies yes and only the men’s minds stayed steadfast as before so off they went to their pens sobbing squealing as circe ﬂung them acorns cornel nuts and mast common fodder for hogs that root and roll in mud back eurylochus ran to our swift black ship to tell the disaster our poor friends had faced but try as he might he couldn’t get a word out numbing sorrow had stunned the man to silence— tears welled in his eyes his heart possessed by grief we assailed him with questi ons—all at our wits’ end— till at last he could recount the fate our friends had met ‘off we went through the brush captain as you commanded deep in the wooded glens we came on circe’s palace built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land someone inside was plying a great loom and how she sang—in a high clear voice goddess or woman—we called out and hailed her … she opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth inviting us all in and in we went all innocence but i stayed behind—i sensed a trap suddenly all vanished—blotted out—not one face showed again though i sat there keeping watch a good long time’ at that report i slung the hefty bronze blade of my silverstudded sword around my shoulder slung my bow on too and told our comrade ‘lead me back by the same way that you came’ but he ﬂung both arms around my knees and pleaded begging me with his tears and winging words ‘don’t force me back there captain king— leave me here on the spot yo u w i l l n e v e r r e t u r n y o u r s e l f i s w e a r you’ll never bring back a single man alive quick cut and run with the rest of us here— we can still escape the fatal day’ but i shot back ‘eurylochus stay right here eating drinking safe by the black ship i must be off necessity drives me on’ leaving the ship and shore i headed inland clambering up through hushed entrancing glades until as i was nearing the halls of circe skilled in spells approaching her palace—hermes god of the golden wand crossed my path and he looked for all the world like a young man sporting his ﬁrst beard just in the prime and warm pride of youth and grasped me by the hand and asked me kindly ‘where are you going now my unlucky friend— trekking over the hills alone in unfamiliar country and your men are all in there in circe’s palace cooped like swine hock by jowl in the sties have you come to set them free well i warn you you won’t get home yourself you’ll stay right there trapped with all the rest but wait i can save you free you from that great danger look here is a potent drug take it to circe’s halls— its power alone will shield you from the fatal day let me tell you of all the witch’s subtle craft … she’ll mix you a potion lace the brew with drugs but she’ll be powerless to bewitch you even so— this magic herb i give will ﬁght her spells now here’s your plan of action step by step the moment circe strikes with her long thin wand you draw your sharp sword sheathed at your hip and rush her fast as if to run her through she’ll cower in fear and coax you to her bed— but don’t refuse the goddess’ bed not then not if she’s to release your friends and treat you well yourself but have her swear the binding oath of the blessed gods she’ll never plot some new intrigue to harm you once you lie there naked— never unman you strip away your courage’ with that the giantkiller handed over the magic herb pulling it from the earth and hermes showed me all its name and nature its root is black and its ﬂower white as milk and the gods call it moly dangerous for a mortal man to pluck from the soil but not for deathless gods all lies within their power now hermes went his way to the steep heights of olympus over the island’s woods while i just approaching the halls of circe my heart a heaving storm at every step paused at her doors the nymph with lovely braids— i stood and shouted to her there she heard my voice she opened the gleaming doors at once and stepped forth inviting me in and in i went all anguish now … she led me in to sit on a silverstudded chair ornately carved with a stool to rest my feet in a golden bowl she mixed a potion for me to drink stirring her poison in her heart aswirl with evil and then she passed it on i drank it down but it never worked its spell— she struck with her wand and ‘now’ she cried ‘off to your sty you swine and wallow with your friends’ but i i drew my sharp sword sheathed at my hip and rushed her fast as if to run her through— she screamed slid under my blade hugged my knees with a ﬂood of warm tears and a burst of winging words ‘who are you where are you from your city your parents i’m wonderstruck—you drank my drugs you’re not bewitched never has any other man withstood my potion never once it’s past his lips and he has drunk it down yo u h a v e a m i n d i n you no magic can enchant yo u m u s t b e o d y s s e u s m a n o f t w i s t s a n d t u r n s — hermes the giantkiller god of the golden wand he always said you’d come homeward bound from troy in your swift black ship come sheathe your sword let’s go to bed together mount my bed and mix in the magic work of love— we’ll breed deep trust between us’ so she enticed but i fought back still wary ‘circe circe how dare you tell me to treat you with any warmth yo u w h o t u r n e d m y m e n t o s w i n e i n y o u r o w n h o u s e a n d n o w you hold me here as well—teeming with treachery you lure me to your room to mount your bed so once i lie there naked you’ll unman me strip away my courage mount your bed not for all the world not until you consent to swear goddess a binding oath you’ll never plot some new intrigue to harm me’ straightaway she began to swear the oath that i required—never she’d never do me harm—and when she’d ﬁnished then at last i mounted circe’s gorgeous bed … at the same time her handmaids bustled through the halls four in all who perform th e goddess’ household tasks nymphs daughters born of the springs and groves and the sacred rivers running down to open sea one draped the chairs with ﬁne crimson covers over the seats she’d spread with linen cloths below a second drew up silver tables before the chairs and laid out golden trays to hold the bread a third mulled heady heartwarming wine in a silver bowl and set out golden cups a fourth brought water and lit a blazing ﬁre beneath a massive cauldron the water heated soon and once it reached the boil in the glowing bronze she eased me into a tub and bathed me from the cauldron mixing the hot and cold to suit my taste showering head and shoulders down until she’d washed away the spiritnumbing exhaustion from my body the bathing ﬁnished rubbing me sleek with oil throwing warm ﬂeece and a shirt around my shoulders she led me in to sit on a silverstudded chair ornately carved with a stool to rest my feet a maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so i might rinse my hands then pulled a gleaming table to my side a staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve me appetizers aplenty too lavish with her bounty she pressed me to eat i had no taste for food i just sat there mind wandering far away … lost in grim forebodings as soon as circe saw me huddled not touching my food immersed in sorrow she sidled near with a coaxing winged word ‘odysseus why just sit there struck dumb eating your heart out not touching food or drink suspect me of still more treachery nothing to fear haven’t i just sworn my solemn binding oath’ so she asked but i protested ‘circe— how could any man in his right mind endure the taste of food and drink before he’d freed his comradesinarms and looked them in the eyes if you you really want me to eat and drink set them free all my beloved comrades— let me feast my eyes’ so i demanded circe strode on through the halls and out her wand held high in hand and ﬂinging open the pens drove forth my men who looked like fullgrown swine facing her there they stood as she went along the ranks anointing them one by one with some new magic oil— and look the bristles grown by the ﬁrst wicked drug that circe gave them slipped away from their limbs and they turned men again younger than ever taller by far more handsome to the eye and yes they knew me at once and each man grasped my hands and a painful longing for tears overcame us all a terrible sobbing echoed through the house … the goddess herself was moved and standing by me warmly urged me on—a lustrous goddess now ‘royal son of laertes odysseus tried and true go at once to your ship at the water’s edge haul her straight up on the shore ﬁrst and stow your cargo and running gear in caves then back you come and bring your trusty crew’ her urging won my stubborn spirit over down i went to the swift ship at the water’s edge and there on the decks i found my loyal crew consumed with grief and weeping live warm tears but now as calves in sta lls when cows come home droves of them herded back from ﬁeld to farmyard once they’ve grazed their ﬁll—as all their young calves come frisking out to meet them bucking out of their pens lowing nonstop jostling rushing round their mothers— so my shipmates there at the sight of my return came pressing round me now streaming tears so deeply moved in their hearts they felt as if they’d made it back to their own land their city ithaca’s rocky soil where they were bred and reared and through their tears their words went winging home ‘y ou’re back again my king how thrilled we are— as if we’d reached our country ithaca at last but come tell us about the fate our comrades met’ still i replied with a timely word of comfort ‘let’s haul our ship straight up on the shore ﬁrst and stow our cargo and running gear in caves then hurry all of you come along with me to see our friends in the magic halls of circe eating and drinking—the feast ﬂows on forever’ so i said and they jumped to do my bidding only eurylochus tried to hold my shipmates back his mutinous outburst aimed at one and all ‘poor fools where are we running now why are we tempting fate— why stumble blindly down to circe’s halls she’ll turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions made to guard that palace of hers—by force i tell you— just as the cyclops trapped our comrades in his lair with hotheaded odysseus right beside them all— thanks to this man’s rashness they died too’ so he declared and i had half a mind to draw the sharp sword from beside my hip and slice his head off tumbling down in the dust close kin that he was but comrades checked me each man trying to calm me left and right ‘captain we’ll leave him here if you command just where he is to sit and guard the ship lead us on to the magic halls of circe’ with that up from the ship and shore they headed inland nor did eurylochus malinger by the hull he straggled behind the rest dreading the sharp blast of my rebuke all the while circe had bathed my other comrades in her palace caring and kindly rubbe d them sleek with oil and decked them out in ﬂeecy cloaks and shirts we found them all together feasting in her halls once we had recognized each other gazing facetoface we all broke down and wept—and the house resounded now and circe the lustrous one came toward me pleading ‘royal son of laertes odysseus man of action no more tears now calm these tides of sorrow well i know what pains you bore on the swarming sea what punishment you endured from hostile men on land but come now eat your food and drink your wine till the same courage ﬁlls your chests now as then when you ﬁrst set sail from native land from rocky ithaca now you are burntout husks your spirits haggard sere always brooding over your wanderings long and hard your hearts never lifting with any joy— you’ve suffered far too much’ so she enticed and won our battlehardened spirits over and there we sat at ease day in day out till a year had run its course feasting on sides of meat and drafts of heady wine … but then when the year was thro ugh and the seasons wheeled by and the months waned and the long days came round again my loyal comrades took me aside and prodded ‘captain this is madness high time you thought of your own home at last if it really is your fate to make it back alive and reach your wellbuilt house and native land’ their urging brought my stubborn spirit round so all that day till the sun went down we sat and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine then when the sun had set and night came on the men lay down to sleep in the shadowed halls but i went up to that luxurious bed of circe’s hugged her by the knees and the goddess heard my winging supplication ‘circe now make good a promise you gave me once— it’s time to help me home my heart longs to be home my comrades’ hearts as well they wear me down pleading with me whenever you’re away’ so i pressed and the lustrous goddess answered me in turn ‘royal son of laertes odysseus old campaigner stay on no more in my house against your will but ﬁrst another journey calls y ou must travel down to the house of death and the awesome one persephone there to consult the ghost of tiresias seer of thebes the great blind prophet whose mind remains unshaken even in death—persephone has given him wisdom everlasting vision to him and him alone … the rest of the dead are empty ﬂitting shades’ so she said and crushed the heart inside me i knelt in her bed and wept i’d no desire to go on living and see the rising light of day but once i’d had my ﬁll of tears and writhing there at last i found the words to venture ‘circe circe who can pilot us on that journey who has ever reached the house of death in a black ship’ the lustrous goddess answered never pausing ‘royal son of laertes odysseus born for exploits let no lack of a pilot at the helm concern you no just step your mast and spread your white sail wide— sit back and the north wind will speed you on your way but once your vessel has cut across the ocean river you will raise a desolate coast and persephone’s grove her tall black poplars willows whose fruit dies young beach your vessel hard by the ocean’s churning shore and make your own way down to the moldering house of death and there into acheron the flood of grief two rivers ﬂow the torrent river of fire the wailing river of tears that branches off from styx the stream of hate and a stark crag looms where the two rivers thunder down and meet once there go forward hero do as i say now dig a trench of about a forearm’s depth and length and around it pour libations out to all the dead— ﬁrst with milk and honey and then with mellow wine then water third and last and sprinkle glistening barley over it all and vow again and again to all the dead to the drifting listless spirits of their ghosts that once you return to ithaca you will slaughter a barren heifer in your halls the best you have and load a pyre with treasures—and to tiresias alone apart you will offer a sleek black ram the pride of all your herds and once your prayers have invoked the nations of the dead in their dim glory slaughter a ram and black ewe turning both their heads toward erebus but turn your head away looking toward the ocean river suddenly then the countless shades of the dead and gone will surge around you there but order your men at once to ﬂay the sheep that lie before you killed by your ruthless blade and burn them both and then say prayers to the gods to the almighty god of death and dread persephone but you—draw your sharp sword from beside your hip sit down on alert there and never let the ghosts of the shambling shiftless dead come near that blood till you have questioned tiresias yourself soon soon the great seer will appear befo re you captain of armies he will tell you the way to go the stages of your voyage how you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last’ and with those words dawn rose on her golden throne and circe dressed me quickly in seacloak and shirt while the queen slipped on a loose glistening robe ﬁlmy a joy to the eye and round her waist she ran a brocaded golden belt and over her head a scarf to shield her brow and i strode on through the halls to stir my men hovering over each with a winning word ‘up now no more lazing away in sleep we must set sail— queen circe has shown the way’ i brought them round my hardy friendsinarms but not even from there could i get them safely off without a loss … there was a man elpenor the youngest in our ranks none too brave in battle none too sound in mind he’d strayed from his mates in circe’s magic halls and keen for the cool night air sodden with wine he’d bedded down on her roofs but roused by the shouts and tread of marching men he leapt up with a start at dawn but still so dazed he forgot to climb back down again by the long ladder— headﬁrst from the roof he plunged his neck snapped from the backbone his soul ﬂew down to death once on our way i gave the men their orders ‘y ou think we are headed home our own dear land well circe sets us a rather different course … down to the house of death and the awesome one persephone there to consult the ghost of tiresias seer of thebes’ so i said and it broke my shipmates’ hearts they sank down on the ground moaning tore their hair but it gained us nothing—what good can come of grief back to the swift ship at the water’s edge we went our spirits deep in anguish faces wet with tears but circe got to the dark hull before us tethered a ram and black ewe close by— slipping past unseen who can glimpse a god who wants to be invisible gliding here and there” book xi the kingdom of the dead “now down we came to the ship at the water’s edge we hauled and launched her into the sunlit breakers ﬁrst stepped the mast in the black craft and set our sail and loaded the sheep aboard the ram and ewe then we ourselves embarked streaming tears our hearts weighed down with anguish … but circe the awesome nymph with lovely braids who speaks with human voice sent us a hardy shipmate yes a fresh following wind rufﬂing up in our wake bellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we securing the running gear from stem to stern sat back while the wind and helmsman kept her true on course the sail stretched taut as she cut the sea all day and the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark and she made the outer limits the ocean river’s bounds where cimmerian people have th eir homes—their realm and city shrouded in mist and cloud the eye of the sun can never ﬂash his rays through the dark and bring them light not when he climbs the starry skies or when he wheels back down from the heights to touch the earth once more— an endless deadly night overhangs those wretched men there gaining that point we beached our craft and herding out the sheep we picked our way by the ocean’s banks until we gained the place that circe made our goal here at the spot perimedes and eurylochus held the victims fast and i drawing my sharp sword from beside my hip dug a trench of about a forearm’s depth and length and around it poured libations out to all the dead ﬁrst with milk and honey and then with mellow wine then water third and last and sprinkled glistening barley over it all and time and again i vowed to all the dead to the drifting listless spirits of their ghosts that once i returned to ithaca i would slaughter a barren heifer in my halls the best i had and load a pyre with treasures—and to tiresias alone apart i would offer a sleek black ram the pride of all my herds and once my vows and prayers had invoked the nations of the dead i took the victims over the trench i cut their throats and the dark blood ﬂowed in—and up out of erebus they came ﬂocking toward me now the ghosts of the dead and gone … brides and unwed youths and old men who had suffered much and girls with their tender hearts freshly scarred by sorrow and great armies of battle dead stabbed by bronze spears men of war still wrapped in bloody armor—thousands swarming around the trench from every side— unearthly cries—blanching terror gripped me i ordered the men at once to ﬂay the sheep that lay before us killed by my ruthless blade and burn them both and then say prayers to the gods to the almighty god of death and dread persephone but i the sharp sword drawn from beside my hip sat down on alert there and never let the ghosts of the shambling shiftless dead come near that blood till i had questioned tiresias myself but ﬁrst the ghost of elpenor my companion came toward me he’d not been buried under the wide ways of earth not yet we’d left his body in circe’s house unwept unburied—this other labor pressed us but i wept to see him now pity touched my heart and i called out a winged word to him there ‘elpenor how did you travel down to the world of darkness faster on foot i see than i in my black ship’ my comrade groaned as he offered me an answer ‘royal son of laertes odysseus old campaigner the doom of an angry god and god knows how much wine— they were my ruin captain … i’d bedded down on the roof of circe’s house but never thought to climb back down again by the long ladder— headﬁrst from the roof i plunged my neck snapped from the backbone my soul ﬂew down to death now i beg you by those you left behind so far from here your wife your father who bred and reared you as a boy and telemachus left at home in your halls your only son well i know when you leave this lodging of the dead that you and your ship will put ashore again at the island of aeaea—then and there my lord remember me i beg you don’t sail off and desert me left behind unwept unburied don’t or my curse may draw god’s fury on your head no burn me in full armor all my harness heap my mound by the churning gray surf— a man whose luck ran out— so even men to come will learn my story perform my rites and plant on my tomb that oar i swung with mates when i rowed among the living’ ‘a l l t h i s m y u n l u c k y f r i e n d ’ i r e a s s u r e d h i m ‘i will do for you i won’t forget a thing’ so we sat and faced each other trading our bleak parting words i on my side holding my sword above the blood he across from me there my comrade’s phantom dragging out his story but look the ghost of my mother came my mother dead and gone now … anticleia—daughter of that great heart autolycus— whom i had left alive when i sailed for sacred troy i broke into tears to see her here but ﬁlled with pity even throbbing with grief i would not let her ghost approach the blood till i had questioned tiresias myself at last he came the shade of the famous theban prophet holding a golden scepter knew me at once and hailed me ‘royal son of laertes odysseus master of exploits man of pain what now what brings you here forsaking the light of day to see this joyless kingdom of the dead stand back from the trench—put up your sharp sword so i can drink the blood and tell you all the truth’ moving back i thrust my silverstudded sword deep in its sheath and once he had drunk the dark blood the words came ringing from the prophet in his power ‘a s w e e t s m o o t h j o u r n e y h o m e r e n o w n e d o d y s s e u s that is what you seek but a god will make it hard for you—i know— you will never escape the one who shakes the earth quaking with anger at you still still enraged because you blinded the cyclops his dear son even so you and your crew may still reach home suffering all the way if you only have the power to curb their wild desire and curb your own what’s more from the day your good trim vessel ﬁrst puts in at thrinacia island ﬂees the cruel blue sea there you will ﬁnd them grazing herds and fat ﬂocks the cattle of helios god of the sun who sees all hears all things leave the beasts unharmed your mind set on home and you all may still reach ithaca—bent with hardship true—but harm them in any way and i can see it now your ship destroyed your men destroyed as well and even if you escape you’ll come home late and come a broken man—all shipmates lost alone in a stranger’s ship— and you will ﬁnd a world of pain at home crude arrogant men devouring all your goods courting your noble wife offering gifts to win her no doubt you will pay them back in blood when you come home but once you have killed those suitors in your halls— by stealth or in open ﬁght with slashing bronze— go forth once more you must … carry your wellplaned oar until you come to a race of people who know nothing of the sea whose food is never seasoned with salt strangers all to ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars wings that make ships ﬂy and here is your sign— unmistakable clear so clear you cannot miss it when another traveler falls in with you and calls that weight across your shoulder a fan to winnow grain then plant your bladed balanced oar in the earth and sacriﬁce ﬁne beasts to the lord god of the sea poseidon—a ram a bull and a ramping wild boar— then journey home and render noble offerings up to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies to all the gods in order and at last your own death will steal upon you … a gentle painless death far from the sea it comes to take you down borne down with the years in ripe old age with all your people there in blessed peace around you all that i have told you will come true’ ‘oh tiresias’ i replied as the prophet ﬁnished ‘surely the gods have spun this out as fate the gods themselves but tell me one thing more and tell me clearly i see the ghost of my longlost mother here before me dead crouching close to the blood in silence she cannot bear to look me in the eyes— her own son—or speak a word to me how lord can i make her know me for the man i am’ ‘one rule there is’ the famous seer explained ‘and simple for me to say and you to learn any one of the ghosts you let approach the blood will speak the truth to you anyone you refuse will turn and fade away’ and with those words now that his prophecies had closed the awesome shade of lord tiresias strode back to the house of death but i kept watch there steadfast till my mother approached and drank the dark clouding blood she knew me at once and wailed out in grief and her words came winging toward me ﬂying home ‘oh my son—what brings you down to the world of death and darkness y ou are still alive it’s hard for the living to catch a glimpse of this … great rivers ﬂow between us terrible waters the ocean ﬁrst of all—no one could ever ford that stream on foot only aboard some sturdy craft have you just come from troy wandering long years with your men and ship not yet returned to ithaca yo u ’ v e s t i l l n o t s e e n y o u r w i f e i n s i d e y o u r h a l l s ’ ‘mother’ i replied ‘i had to venture down to the house of death to consult the shade of tiresias seer of thebes never yet have i neared achaea never once set foot on native ground always wandering—endless hardship from that day i ﬁrst set sail with king agamemnon bound for troy the stallionland to ﬁght the trojans there but tell me about yourself and spare me nothing what form of death overcame you what laid you low some long slow illness or did artemis showering arrows come with her painless shafts and bring you down tell me of father tell of the son i left behind do my royal rights still lie in their safekeeping or does some stranger hold the throne by now because men think that i’ll come home no more please tell me about my wife her turn of mind her thoughts … still standing fast beside our son still guarding our great estates secure as ever now or has she wed some other countryman at last the ﬁnest prince among them’ ‘surely surely’ my noble mother answered quickly ‘she’s still waiting there in your halls poor woman suffering so her life an endless hardship like your own … wasting away the nights weeping away the days no one has taken over your royal rights not yet telemachus still holds your great estates in peace he attends the public banquets shared with all the feasts a man of justice should enjoy for every lord invites him as for your father he keeps to his own farm—he never goes to town— with no bed for him there no blankets glossy throws all winter long he sleeps in the lodge with servants in the ashes by the ﬁre his body wrapped in rags but when summer comes and the bumper crops of harvest any spot on the rising ground of his vineyard rows he makes his bed heaped high with fallen leaves and there he lies in anguish … with his old age bearing hard upon him too and his grief grows as he longs for your return and i with the same grief i died and met my fate no sharpeyed huntress showering arrows through the halls approached and brought me down with painless shafts nor did some hateful illness strike me that so often devastates the body drains our limbs of power no it was my longing for you my shining odysseus— you and your quickness you and your gentle ways— that tore away my life that had been sweet’ and i my mind in turmoil how i longed to embrace my mother’s spirit dead as she was three times i rushed toward her desperate to hold her three times she ﬂuttered through my ﬁngers sifting away like a shadow dissolving like a dream and each time the grief cut to the heart sharper yes and i i cried out to her words winging into the darkness ‘mother—why not wait for me how i long to hold you— so even here in the house of death we can ﬂing our loving arms around each other take some joy in the tears that numb the heart or is this just some wraith that great persephone sends my way to make me ache with sorrow all the more’ my noble mother answered me at once ‘my son my son the unluckiest man alive this is no deception sent by queen persephone this is just the way of mortals when we die sinews no longer bind the ﬂesh and bones together— the ﬁre in all its fury burns the body down to ashes once life slips from the white bones and the spirit rustling ﬂitters away … ﬂown like a dream but you must long for the daylight go quickly remember all these things so one day you can tell them to your wife’ and so we both conﬁded trading parting words and there slowly came a grand array of women all sent before me now by august persephone and all were wives and daughters once of princes they swarmed in a ﬂock around the dark blood while i searched for a way to question each alone and the more i thought the more this seemed the best drawing forth the long sharp sword from beside my hip i would not let them drink the dark blood all in a rush and so they waited coming forward one after another each declared her lineage and i explored them all and the ﬁrst i saw there tyro born of kings who said her father was that great lord salmoneus said that she was the wife of cretheus aeolus’ son and once she fell in love with the river god enipeus far the clearest river ﬂowing across the earth and so she’d haunt enipeus’ glinting streams till taking his shape one day the god who girds the earth and makes it tremble bedded her where the swirling river rushes out to sea and a surging wave reared up high as a mountain dark arching over to hide the god and mortal girl together loosing her virgin belt he lapped her round in sleep and when the god had consummated his work of love he took her by the hand and hailed her warmly ‘rejoice in our love my lady and when this year has run its course you will give birth to glorious children— bedding down with the gods is never barren futile— and you must tend them breed and rear them well now home you go and restrain yourself i say never breathe your lover’s name but know— i am poseidon god who rocks the earth’ with that he dove back in the heaving waves and she conceived for the god and bore him pelias neleus and both grew up to be stal wart aides of zeus almighty both men alike pelias lived on the plains of iolcos rich in sheepﬂocks neleus lived in sandy pylos and the noble queen bore sons to cretheus too aeson pheres and amythaon exultant charioteer and after tyro i saw asopus’ daughter antiope proud she’d spent a night in the arms of zeus himself and borne the god twin sons amphion and zethus the ﬁrst to build the footings of sevengated thebes her bastions too for lacking ramparts none could live in a place so vast so open—strong as both men were and i saw alcmena next amphitryon’s wife who slept in the clasp of zeus and merged in love and brought forth heracles rugged will and lion heart and i saw megara too magnanimous creon’s daughter wed to the stalwart heracles the hero never daunted and i saw the mother of oedipus beautiful epicaste what a monstrous thing she did in all innocence— she married her own son … who’d killed his father then he married her but the gods soon made it known to all mankind so he in growing pain ruled on in beloved thebes lording cadmus’ people—thanks to the gods’ brutal plan— while she went down to death who guards the massive gates lashing a noose to a steep rafter there she hanged aloft strangling in all her anguish leaving her son to bear the world of horror a mother’s furies bring to life and i saw magniﬁcent chloris the one whom neleus wooed and won with a hoard of splendid gifts so dazzled by her beauty years ago … the youngest daughter of iasus’ son amphion the great minyan king who ruled orchomenos once she was his queen in pylos she bore him shining sons nestor and chromius periclymenus too good prince and after her sons she bore a daughter majestic pero the marvel of her time courted by all the young lords round about but neleus would not give her to any suitor none but the man who might drive home the herds that powerful iphiclus had stolen lurching broad in the brow those longhorned beasts and no small task to round them up from phylace only the valiant seer melampus volunteered— he would drive them home— but a god’s iron sentence bound him fast barbarous herdsmen dragged him off in chains ye t w h e n t h e m o n t h s a n d d a y s h a d r u n t h e i r c o u r s e and the year wheeled round and the seasons came again then mighty iphiclus loosed the prophet’s shackles once he had told him all the gods’ decrees and so the will of zeus was done at last and i saw leda next tyndareus’ wife who’d borne the king two sons intrepid twins castor breaker of horses and the hardy boxer polydeuces both buried now in the lifegiving earth though still alive even under the earth zeus grants them that distinction one day alive the next day dead each twin by turns they both hold honors equal to the gods’ and i saw iphimedeia next aloeus’ wife who claimed she lay in the sealord’s loving waves and gave the god two sons but they did not live long otus staunch as a god and farfamed ephialtes they were the tallest men the fertile earth has borne the handsomest too by far aside from renowned orion nine yards across they measured even at nine years old nine fathoms tall they towered they even threatened the deathless gods they’d storm olympus’ heights with the pounding rush and grinding shock of battle they were wild to pile ossa upon olympus then on ossa pelion dense with timber—their toeholds up the heavens and they’d have won the day if they had reached peak strength but apollo the son of zeus whom sleekhaired leto bore laid both low before their beards had sprouted covering cheek and chin with a fresh crop of down phaedra and procris too i saw and lovely ariadne daughter of minos that harsh king one day theseus tried to spirit her off from crete to athens’ sacred heights but he got no joy from her artemis killed her ﬁrst on wavewashed dia’s shores accused by dionysus and i saw clymene maera and loathsome eriphyle— bribed with a golden necklace to lure her lawful husband to his death … but the whole cortege i could never tally never name not all the daughters and wives of great men i saw there long before that the godsent night would ebb away but the time has come for sleep either with friends aboard your swift ship or here in your own house my passage home will rest with the gods and you” odysseus paused … they all fell silent hushed his story holding them spellbound down the shadowed halls till the whitearmed queen arete suddenly burst out “phaeacians how does this man impress you now his looks his build the balanced mind inside him the stranger is my guest but each of you princes shares the honor here so let’s not be too hasty to send him on his way and don’t scrimp on his gifts his need is great great as the riches piled up in your houses thanks to the gods’ good will” following her the old revered echeneus added his support the eldest lord on the island of phaeacia “friends the words of our considerate queen— they never miss the mark or fail our expectations so do as arete says though on alcinous here depend all words and action” “a n d s o i t w i l l b e ” — alcinous stepped in grandly—”sure as i am alive and rule our island men who love their oars our guest much as he longs for passage home must stay and wait it out here till tomorrow till i can collect his whole array of parting gifts his sendoff rests with every noble here but with me most of all i hold the reins of power in the realm” odysseus deft and tactful echoed back “a l c i n o u s m a j e s t y s h i n i n g a m o n g y o u r i s l a n d p e o p l e if you would urge me now to stay here one whole year then speed me home weighed down with lordly gifts i’d gladly have it so better by far i’d say the fuller my arms on landing there at home the more respected wellreceived i’d be by all who saw me sailing back to ithaca” “a h o d y s s e u s ” a l c i n o u s r e p l i e d “ o n e l o o k a t y o u and we know that you are no one who would cheat us— no fraud such as the dark soil breeds and spreads across the face of the earth these days crowds of vagabonds frame their lies so tightly none can test them but you what grace you give your words and what good sense within yo u h a v e t o l d y o u r s t o r y w i t h a l l a s i n g e r ’s s k i l l the miseries you endured your great achaeans too but come now tell me truly your godlike comrades— did you see any heroes down in the house of death any who sailed with you and met their doom at troy the night’s still young i’d say the night is endless for us in the palace now it’s hardly time for sleep keep telling us your adventures—they are wonderful i could hold out here till dawn’s ﬁrst light if only you could bear here in our halls to tell the tale of all the pains you suffered” so the man of countless exploits carried on “a l c i n o u s m a j e s t y s h i n i n g a m o n g y o u r i s l a n d p e o p l e there is a time for many words a time for sleep as well but if you insist on hearing more i’d never stint on telling my own tale and those more painful still the griefs of my comrades dead in the war’s wake who escaped the battlecries of trojan armies only to die in blood at journey’s end— thanks to a vicious woman’s will now then no sooner had queen persephone driven off the ghosts of lovely women scattering left and right than forward marched the shade of atreus’ son agamemnon fraught with grief and ﬂank ed by all his comrades troops of his menatarms who died beside him who met their fate in lord aegisthus’ halls he knew me at once as soon as he drank the blood and wailed out shrilly tears sprang to his eyes he thrust his arms toward me keen to embrace me there— no use—the great force was gone the strength lost forever now that ﬁlled his rippling limbs in the old days i wept at the sight my heart went out to the man my words too in a winging ﬂight of pity ‘famous atrides lord of men agamemnon what fatal stroke of destiny brought you down wrecked in the ships when lord poseidon roused some punishing blast of stormwinds gust on gust or did ranks of enemies mow you down on land as you tried to raid and cut off herds and ﬂocks or fought to win their city take their women’ the ﬁeld marshal’s ghost replied at once ‘royal son of laertes odysseus mastermind of war i was not wrecked in the ships when lord poseidon roused some punishing blast of stormwinds gust on gust nor did ranks of enemies mow me down on land— aegisthus hatched my doom and my destruction he killed me he with my own accursed wife … he invited me to his palace sat me down to feast then cut me down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough so i died—a wretched ignominious death—and round me all my comrades killed no mercy one after another just like whitetusked boars butchered in some rich lord of power’s halls for a wedding banquet or groaning public feast yo u i n y o u r d a y h a v e w i t n e s s e d h u n d r e d s s l a u g h t e r e d killed in single combat or killed in pitched battle true but if you’d laid eyes on this it would have wrenched your heart how we sprawled by the mixingbowl and loaded tables there throughout the palace the whole ﬂoor awash with blood but the deathshriek of cassandra priam’s daughter— most pitiful thing i heard my treacherous queen clytemnestra killed her over my body yes and i lifting my ﬁsts beat them down on the ground dying dying writhing around the sword but she that whore she turned her back on me well on my way to death—she even lacked the heart to seal my eyes with her hand or close my jaws so there’s nothing more deadly bestial than a woman set on works like these—what a monstrous thing she plotted slaughtered her own lawful husband why i expected at least some welcome home from all my children all my household slaves when i came sailing back again … but she— the queen hellbent on outrage—bathes in shame not only herself but the whole breed of womankind even the honest ones to come forever down the years’ so he declared and i cried out ‘how terrible zeus from the very start the thunder king has hated the race of atreus with a vengeance— his trustiest weapon women’s twisted wiles what armies of us died for the sake of helen … clytemnestra schemed your death while you were worlds away’ ‘true true’ agamemnon’s ghost kept pressing on ‘so even your own wife—never indulge her too far never reveal the whole truth whatever you may know just tell her a part of it be sure to hide the rest not that you odysseus will be murdered by your wife she’s much too steady her feelings run too deep icarius’ daughter penelope that wise woman she was a young bride i well remember … we left her behind when we went off to war with an infant boy she nestled at her breast that boy must sit and be counted with the men now— happy man his beloved father will come sailing home and see his son and he will embrace his father that is only right but my wife—she never even let me feast my eyes on my own son she killed me ﬁrst his father i tell you this—bear it in mind you must— when you reach your homeland steer your ship into port in secret never out in the open … the time for trusting women’s gone forever enough come tell me this and be precise have you heard news of my so n where’s he living now perhaps in orchomenos perhaps in sandy pylos or off in the spartan plains with menelaus he’s not dead yet my prince orestes no he’s somewhere on the earth’ so he probed but i cut it short ‘ atrides why ask me that i know nothing whether he’s dead or alive it’s wrong to lead you on with idle words’ so we stood there trading heartsick stories deep in grief as the tears streamed down our faces but now there came the ghosts of peleus’ son achilles patroclus fearless antilochus—and great ajax too the ﬁrst in stature ﬁrst in build and bearing of all the argives after peleus’ matchless son the ghost of the splendid runner knew me at once and hailed me with a ﬂight of mournful questions ‘royal son of laertes od ysseus man of tactics reckless friend what next what greater feat can that cunning head contrive what daring brought you down to the house of death— where the senseless burntout wrai ths of mortals make their home’ the voice of his spirit paused and i was quick to answer ‘a c h i l l e s s o n o f p e l e u s g r e a t e s t o f t h e a c h a e a n s i had to consult tiresias driven here by hopes he would help me journey home to rocky ithaca never yet have i neared achaea never once set foot on native ground … my life is endless trouble but you achilles there’s not a man in the world more blest than you— there never has been never will be one time was when you were alive we argives honored you as a god and now down here i see you lord it over the dead in all your power so grieve no more at dying great achilles’ i reassured the ghost but he broke out protesting ‘no winning words about death to me shining odysseus by god i’d rather slave on earth for another man— some dirtpoor tenant farmer who scrapes to keep alive— than rule down here over all the breathless dead but come tell me the news about my gallant son did he make his way to the wars did the boy become a champion—yes or no tell me of noble peleus any word you’ve heard— still holding pride of place among his myrmidon hordes or do they despise the man in hellas and in phthia because old age has lamed his arms and legs for i no longer stand in the light of day— the man i was—comradeinarms to help my father as once i helped our armies killing the best ﬁghters troy could ﬁeld in the wide world up there … oh to arrive at father’s house—the man i was for one brief day—i’d make my fury and my hands invincible hands a thing of terror to all those men who abuse the king with force and wrest away his honor’ so he grieved but i tried to lend him heart ‘a b o u t n o b l e p e l e u s i c a n t e l l y o u n o t h i n g but about your own dear son neoptolemus i can report the whole story as you wish i myself in my trim ship i brought him out of scyros to join the argives under arms and dug in around troy debating battletactics he always spoke up ﬁrst and always on the mark— godlike nestor and i alone excelled the boy y es and when our armies fought on the plain of troy he’d never hang back with the main force of men— he’d always charge ahead giving ground to no one in his fury and scores of men he killed in bloody combat how could i list them all name them all now the ﬁghting ranks he leveled battling for the argives but what a soldier he laid low with a bronze sword the hero eurypylus telephus’ son and round him troops of his own cetean comrades slaughtered lured to war by the bribe his mother took the only man i saw to put eurypylus in the shade was memnon son of the morning again when our champions climbed inside the horse that epeus built with labor and i held full command to spring our packed ambush open or keep it sealed all our lords and captains were wiping off their tears knees shaking beneath each man—but not your son never once did i see his glowing skin go pale he never ﬂicked a tear from his cheeks no he kept on begging me there to let him burst from the horse kept gripping his hilted sword his heavy bronzetipped javelin keen to loose his ﬁghting fury against the trojans then once we’d sacked king priam’s craggy city laden with his fair share and princely prize he boarded his own ship his body all unscarred not a wound from a ﬂying spear or a sharp sword cutandthrust close up—the common marks of war random raging ares plays no favorites’ so i said and off he went the ghost of the great runner aeacus’ grandson loping with long strides across the ﬁelds of asphodel triumphant in all i had told him of his son his gallant glorious son now the rest of the ghosts the dead and gone came swarming up around me—deep in sorrow there each asking about the grief that touched him most only the ghost of great ajax son of telamon kept his distance blazing with anger at me still for the victory i had won by the ships that time i pressed my claim for the arms of prince achilles his queenly mother had set them up as prizes pallas and captive trojans served as judges would to god i’d never won such trophies all for them the earth closed over ajax that proud hero ajax … greatest in build greatest in works of war of all the argives after peleus’ matchless son i cried out to him now i tried to win him over ‘a j a x s o n o f n o b l e te l a m o n s t i l l d e t e r m i n e d even in death not once to forget that rage you train on me for those accursed arms the gods set up that prize to plague the achaeans— so great a tower of strength we lost when you went down for your death we grieved as we did for achilles’ death— we grieved incessantly true and none’s to blame but zeus who hated achaea’s ﬁghting spearmen so intensely zeus sealed your doom come closer king and listen to my story conquer your rage your blazing headstrong pride’ so i cried out but ajax answered not a word he stalked off toward erebus into the dark to join the other lost departed dead ye t n o w d e s p i t e h i s a n g e r he might have spoken to me or i to him but the heart inside me stirred with some desire to see the ghosts of others dead and gone and i saw minos there illustrious son of zeus ﬁrmly enthroned holding his golden scepter judging all the dead … some on their feet some seated all clustering round the king of justice pleading for his verdicts reached in the house of death with its allembracing gates i next caught sight of orion that huge hunter rounding up on the ﬁelds of asphodel those wild beasts the man in life cut down on the lonely mountainslopes brandishing in his hands the bronzestudded club that time can never shatter i saw tityus too son of the mighty goddess earth—sprawling there on the ground spread over nine acres—two vultures hunched on either side of him digging into his liver beaking deep in the bloodsac and he with his frantic hands could never beat them off for he had once dragged off the famous consort of zeus in all her glory leto threading her way toward pytho’s ridge over the lovely dancingrings of panopeus and i saw tantalus too bearing endless torture he stood erect in a pool as the water lapped his chin— parched he burned to drink but he could not reach the surface no time and again the old man stooped craving a sip time and again the water vanished swallowed down laying bare the caked black earth at his feet— some spirit drank it dry and over his head leafy trees dangled their fruit from high aloft pomegranates and pears and apples glowing red succulent ﬁgs and olives swelling sleek and dark but soon as the old man would strain to clutch them fast a gust would toss them up to the lowering dark clouds and i saw sisyphus too bound to his own torture grappling his monstrous boulder with both arms working heaving hands struggling legs driving he kept on thrusting the rock uphill toward the brink but just as it teetered set to topple over— time and again the immense weight of the thing would wheel it back and the ruthless boulder would bound and tumble down to the plain again— so once again he would heave would struggle to thrust it up sweat drenching his body dust swirling above his head and next i caught a glimpse of powerful heracles— his ghost i mean the man himself delights in the grand feasts of the deathless gods on high wed to hebe famed for her lithe alluring ankles the daughter of mighty zeus and hera shod in gold around him cries of the dead rang out like cries of birds scattering left and right in horror as on he came like night naked bow in his grip an arrow grooved on the bowstring glaring round him ﬁercely forever poised to shoot a terror too that swordbelt sweeping across his chest a baldric of solid gold emblazoned with awesome work … bears and ramping boars and lions with wild ﬁery eyes and wars routs and battles massacres butchered men may the craftsman who forged that masterpiece— whose skills could conjure up a belt like that— never forge another heracles knew me at once at ﬁrst glance and hailed me with a winging burst of pity ‘royal son of laertes odysseus famed for exploits luckless man you too braving out a fate as harsh as the fate i bore alive in the light of day son of zeus that i was my torments never ended forced to slave for a man not half the man i was he saddled me with the worst heartbreaking labors why he sent me down here once to retrieve the hound that guards the dead—no harder task for me he thought— but i dragged the great beast up from the underworld to earth and hermes and gleamingeyed athena blazed the way’ with that he turned and back he went to the house of death but i held fast in place hoping others might still come shades of famous heroes men who died in the old days and ghosts of an even older age i longed to see theseus and pirithous the gods’ own radiant sons but before i could the dead came surging round me hordes of them thousands raising unearthly cries and blanching terror gripped me—panicked now that queen persephone might send up from death some monstrous head some gorgon’s staring face i rushed back to my ship commanded all hands to take to the decks and cast off cables quickly they swung aboard at once they sat to the oars in ranks and a strong tide of the ocean river swept her on downstream sped by our rowing ﬁrst then by a fresh fair wind” book xii the cattle of the sun “now when our ship had left the ocean river rolling in her wake and launched out into open sea with its long swells to reach the island of aeaea—east where the dawn forever young has home and dancingrings and the sun his risings— heading in we beached our craft on the sands the crews swung out on the low sloping shore and there we fell asleep awaiting dawn’s ﬁrst light as soon as dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone again i dispatched some men to circe’s halls to bring the dead elpenor’s body we cut logs in haste and out on the island’s sharpest jutting headland held his funeral rites in sorrow streaming tears once we’d burned the dead man and the dead man’s armor heaping his gravemound hauling a stone that coped it well we planted his balanced oar aloft to crown his tomb and so we saw to his rites each step in turn nor did our coming back from death escape circe— she hurried toward us decked in rich regalia handmaids following close with trays of bread and meats galore and glinting ruddy wine and the lustrous goddess standing in our midst hailed us warmly ‘ ah my darling reckless friends yo u w h o v e n t u r e d d o w n t o t h e h o u s e o f d e a t h a l i v e doomed to die twice over—others die just once come take some food and drink some wine rest here the livelong day and then tomorrow at daybreak you must sail but i will set you a course and chart each seamark so neither on sea nor land will some new trap ensnare you in trouble make you suffer more’ her foresight won our ﬁghting spirits over so all that day till the sun went down we sat and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine and then when the sun had set and night came on the men lay down to sleep by the ship’s sterncables but circe taking me by the hand drew me away from all my shipmates there and sat me down and lying beside me probed me for details i told her the whole story start to ﬁnish then the queenly goddess laid my course ‘y our descent to the dead is over true but listen closely to what i tell you now and god himself will bring it back to mind first you will raise the island of the sirens those creatures who spellbind any man alive whoever comes their way whoever draws too close off guard and catches the sirens’ voices in the air— no sailing home for him no wife rising to meet him no happy children beaming up at their father’s face the high thrilling song of the sirens will transﬁx him lolling there in their meadow round them heaps of corpses rotting away rags of skin shriveling on their bones … race straight past that coast soften some beeswax and stop your shipmates’ ears so none can hear none of the crew but if you are bent on hearing have them tie you hand and foot in the swift ship erect at the mastblock lashed by ropes to the mast so you can hear the sirens’ song to your heart’s content but if you plead commanding your men to set you free then they must lash you faster rope on rope but once your crew has rowed you past the sirens a choice of routes is yours i cannot advise you which to take or lead you through it all— you must decide for yourself— but i can tell you the ways of either course on one side beetling cliffs shoot up and against them pound the huge roaring breakers of blueeyed amphitrite— the clashing rocks they’re called by all the blissful gods not even birds can escape them no not even the doves that veer and ﬂy ambrosia home to father zeus even of those the sheer rocks always pick off one and father wings one more to keep the number up no ship of men has ever approached and slipped past— always some disaster—big timbers and sailors’ corpses whirled away by the waves and lethal blasts of ﬁre one ship alone one deepsea craft sailed clear the argo sung by the world when heading home from aeetes’ shores and she would have crashed against those giant rocks and sunk at once if hera for love of jason had not sped her through on the other side loom two enormous crags … one thrusts into the vaulting sky its jagged peak hooded round with a dark cloud that never leaves— no clear bright air can ever bathe its crown not even in summer’s heat or harvesttime no man on earth could scale it mount its crest not even with twenty hands and twenty feet for climbing the rock’s so smooth like dressed and burnished stone and halfway up that cliffside stands a fogbound cavern gaping west toward erebus realm of death and darkness— past it great odysseus you should steer your ship no rugged young archer could hit that yawning cave with a winged arrow shot from off the decks scylla lurks inside it—the yelping horror yelping no louder than any suckling pup but she’s a grisly monster i assure you no one could look on her with any joy not even a god who meets her facetoface … she has twelve legs all writhing dangling down and six long swaying necks a hideous head on each each head barbed with a triple row of fangs thickset packed tight—armed to the hilt with black death holed up in the cavern’s bowels from her waist down she shoots out her heads out of that terrifying pit angling right from her nest wildly sweeping the reefs for dolphins dogﬁsh or any bigger quarry she can drag from the thousands amphitrite spawns in groaning seas no mariners yet can boast they’ve raced their ship past scylla’s lair without some mortal blow— with each of her six heads she snatches up a man from the darkprowed craft and whisks him off the other crag is lower—you will see odysseus— though both lie sidebyside an arrowshot apart atop it a great ﬁgtree rises shaggy with leaves beneath it awesome charybdis gulps the dark water down three times a day she vomits it up three times she gulps it down that terror don’t be there when the whirlpool swallows down— not even the earthquake god could save you from disaster no hug scylla’s crag—sail on past her—top speed better by far to lose six men and keep your ship than lose your entire crew’ ‘y es yes but tell me the truth now goddess’ i protested ‘deadly charybdis—can’t i possibly cut and run from her and still ﬁght scylla off when scylla strikes my men’ ‘so stubborn’ the lovely goddess countered ‘hellbent yet again on battle and feats of arms can’t you bow to the deathless gods themselves scylla’s no mortal she’s an immortal devastation terrible savage wild no ﬁghting her no defense— just ﬂee the creature that’s the only way waste any time arming for battle beside her rock i fear she’ll lunge out again with all of her six heads and seize as many men no row for your lives invoke brute force i tell you scylla’s mother— she spawned her to scourge mankind she can stop the monster’s next attack then you will make the island of thrinacia … where herds of the sungod’s cattle graze and fat sheep and seven herds of oxen as many sheepﬂocks rich and woolly ﬁfty head in each no breeding swells their number nor do they ever die and goddesses herd them on nymphs with glinting hair phaethousa lampetie born to the sungod helios by radiant neaera their queenly mother bred and reared them both then settled them on the island of thrinacia— their homeland seas away— to guard their father’s sheep and longhorn cattle leave the beasts unharmed your mind set on home and you all may still reach ithaca—bent with hardship true—but harm them in any way and i can see it now your ship destroyed your men destroyed as well and even if you escape you’ll come home late all shipmates lost and come a broken man’ at those words dawn rose on her golden throne and lustrous circe made he r way back up the island i went straight to my ship commanding all hands to take to the decks and cast off cables quickly they swung aboard at once they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke and circe the nymph with glossy braids the awesome one who speaks with human voice sent us a hardy shipmate yes a fresh following wind rufﬂing up in our wake bellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we securing the running gear from stem to stern sat back while the wind and helmsman kept her true on course at last and sore at heart i told my shipmates ‘friends … it’s wrong for only one or two to know the revelations that lovely circe made to me alone i’ll tell you all so we can die with our eyes wide open now or escape our fate and certain death together first she warns we must steer clear of the sirens their enchanting song their meadow starred with ﬂowers i alone was to hear their voices so she said but you must bind me with tight chaﬁng ropes so i cannot move a muscle bound to the spot erect at the mastblock lashed by ropes to the mast and if i plead commanding you to set me free then lash me faster rope on pressing rope’ so i informed my shipmates point by point all the while our trim ship was speeding toward the sirens’ island driven on by the brisk wind but then—the wind fell in an instant all glazed to a dead calm … a mysterious power hushed the heaving swells the oarsmen leapt to their feet struck the sail stowed it deep in the hold and sat to the oarlocks thrashing with polished oars frothing the water white now with a sharp sword i sliced an ample wheel of beeswax down into pieces kneaded th em in my two strong hands and the wax soon grew soft worked by my strength and helios’ burning rays the sun at high noon and i stopped the ears of my comrades one by one they bound me hand and foot in the tight ship— erect at the mastblock lashed by ropes to the mast— and rowed and churned the whitecaps stroke on stroke we were just offshore as far as a man’s shout can carry scudding close when the sirens sensed at once a ship was racing past and burst into their high thrilling song ‘come closer famous odysseus—achaea’s pride and glory— moor your ship on our coast so you can hear our song never has any sailor passed our shores in his black craft until he has heard the honeyed voices pouring from our lips and once he hears to his heart’s content sails on a wiser man we know all the pains that achaeans and trojans once endured on the spreading plain of troy when the gods willed it so— all that comes to pass on the fertile earth we know it all’ so they sent their ravishing voices out across the air and the heart inside me throbbed to listen longer i signaled the crew with frowns to set me free— they ﬂung themselves at the oars and rowed on harder perimedes and eurylochus springing up at once to bind me faster with rope on chaﬁng rope but once we’d left the sirens fading in our wake once we could hear their song no more their urgent call— my steadfast crew was quick to remove the wax i’d used to seal their ears and loosed the bonds that lashed me we’d scarcely put that island astern when suddenly i saw smoke and heavy breakers heard their booming thunder the men were terriﬁed—oarblades ﬂew from their grip clattering down to splash in the vessel’s wash she lay there dead in the water … no hands to tug the blades that drove her on but i strode down the decks to rouse my crewmen halting beside each one with a bracing winning word ‘friends we’re hardly strangers at meeting danger— and this danger is no worse than what we faced when cyclops penned us up in his vaulted cave with crushing force but even from there my courage my presence of mind and tactics saved us all and we will live to remember this someday i have no doubt up now follow my orders all of us work as one y ou men at the thwarts— lay on with your oars and strike the heaving swells trusting that zeus will pull us through these straits alive yo u h e l m s m a n h e r e ’s y o u r o r d e r — b u r n i t i n y o u r m i n d — the steeringoar of our rolling ship is in your hands keep her clear of that smoke and surging breakers head for those crags or she’ll catch you off guard she’ll yaw over there—you’ll plunge us all in ruin’ so i shouted they snapped to each command no mention of scylla—how to ﬁght that nightmare— for fear the men would panic desert their oars and huddle down and stow themselves away but now i cleared my mind of circe’s orders— cramping my style urging me not to arm at all i donned my heroic armor seized long spears in both my hands and marched out on the halfdeck forward hoping from there to catch the ﬁrst glimpse of scylla ghoul of the cliffs swooping to kill my men but nowhere could i make her out—and my eyes ached scanning that mistbound rock face top to bottom now wailing in fear we rowed on up those straits scylla to starboard dreaded charybdis off to port her horrible whirlpool gulping the seasurge down down but when she spewed it up—like a cauldron over a raging ﬁre— all her churning depths would seethe and heave—exploding spray showering down to splatter” the peaks of both crags at once but when she swallowed the seasurge down her gaping maw the whole abyss lay bare and the rocks around her roared terrible deafening— bedrock showed down deep boiling black with sand— and ashen terror gripped the men but now fearing death all eyes ﬁxed on charybdis— now scylla snatched six men from our hollow ship the toughest strongest hands i had and glancing backward over the decks searching for my crew i could see their hands and feet already hoisted ﬂailing high higher over my head look— wailing down at me comrades riven in agony shrieking out my name for one last time just as an angler poised on a jutting rock ﬂings his treacherous bait in the offshore swell whips his long rod—hook sheathed in an oxhorn lure— and whisks up little ﬁsh he ﬂips on the beachbreak writhing gasping out their lives … so now they writhed gasping as scylla swung them up her cliff and there at her cavern’s mouth she bolted them down raw— screaming out ﬂinging their arms toward me lost in that mortal struggle … of all the pitiful things i’ve had to witness suffering searching out the pathways of the sea this wrenched my heart the most but now at last putting the rocks scylla an d dread charybdis far astern we quickly reached the good green island of the sun where helios lord hyperion keeps his ﬁne cattle broad in the brow and ﬂocks of purebred sheep still aboard my black ship in the open sea i could hear the lowing cattle driven home the bleating sheep and i was struck once more by the words of the blind theban prophet tiresias and aeaean circe too time and again they told me to shun this island of the sun the joy of man so i warned my shipmates gravely sick at heart ‘listen to me my comrades brothers in hardship let me tell you the dire prophecies of tiresias and aeaean circe too time and again they told me to shun this island of the sun the joy of man here they warned the worst disaster awaits us row straight past these shores—race our black ship on’ so i said and the warnings broke their hearts but eurylochus waded in at once—with mutiny on his mind ‘y ou’re a hard man odysseus y our ﬁghting spirit’s stronger than ours your stamina never fails yo u m u s t b e m a d e o f i r o n h e a d t o f o o t l o o k your crew’s halfdead with labor starved for sleep and you forbid us to set foot on land this island here washed by the waves where we mi ght catch a decent meal again drained as we are night falling fast you’d have us desert this haven and blunder off into the mistbound seas out of the night come winds that shatter vessels— how can a man escape his headlong death if suddenly out of nowhere a cyclone hits bred by the south or stormy west wind they’re the gales that tear a ship to splinters—the gods our masters willing or not it seems no let’s give way to the dark night set out our supper here sit tight by our swift ship and then at daybreak board and launch her make for open sea’ so eurylochus urged and shipmates cheered then i knew some power was brewing trouble for us so i let ﬂy with an anxious plea ‘eurylochus i’m one against all—the upper hand is yours but swear me a binding oath all here that if we come on a herd of cattle or ﬁne ﬂock of sheep not one man among us—blind in his reckless ways— will slaughter an ox or ram just eat in peace content with the food immortal circe gave us’ they quickly swore the oath that i required and once they had vowed they’d never harm the herds they moored our sturdy ship in the deep narrow harbor close to a fresh spring and all hands disembarked and adeptly set about the evening meal once they’d put aside desire for food and drink they recalled our dear companions wept for the men that scylla plucked from the hollow ship and ate alive and a welcome sleep came on them in their tears but then at the night’s third watch the stars just wheeling down zeus who marshals the stormclouds loosed a ripping wind a howling demonic gale shrouding over in thunderheads the earth and sea at once—and ni ght swept down from the sky when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more we hauled our craft ashore securing her in a vaulted cave where nymphs have lovely dancingrings and hold their sessions there i called a muster warning my shipmates yet again ‘friends we’ve food and drink aplenty aboard the ship— keep hands off all these herds or we will pay the price the cattle the sleek ﬂocks belong to an awesome master helios god of the sun who sees all hears all things’ so i warned and my headstrong men complied but for one whole month the south wind blew nonstop no other wind came up none but the south southeast as long as our food and ruddy wine held out the crew eager to save their lives kept hands off the herds but then when supplies aboard had all run dry when the men turned to hunting forced to range for quarry with twisted hooks for ﬁsh birds anything they could lay their hands on— hunger racked their bellies—i struck inland up the island there to pray to the gods if only one might show me some way home crossing into the heartland clear of the crew i rinsed my hands in a sheltered spot a windbreak but soon as i’d prayed to all the gods who rule olympus down on my eyes they poured a sweet sound sleep … as eurylochus opened up hi s fatal plan to friends ‘listen to me my comrades brothers in hardship all ways of dying are hateful to us poor mortals true but to die of hunger starve to death— that’s the worst of all so up with you now let’s drive off the pick of helios’ sleek herds slaughter them to the gods who rule the skies up there if we ever make it home to ithaca native ground erect at once a glorious temple to the sungod line the walls with hoards of dazzling gifts but if the sun inﬂamed for his longhorn cattle means to wreck our ship and the other gods pitch in— i’d rather die at sea with one deep gulp of death than die by inches on this desolate island here’ so he urged and shipmates cheered again at once they drove off the sungod’s ﬁnest cattle— close at hand not far from the blueprowed ship they grazed those splendid beasts with their broad brows and curving horns surrounding them in a ring they lifted prayers to the gods plucking fresh green leaves from a tall oak for the rite since white strewingbarley was long gone in the ship once they’d prayed slaughtered and skinned the cattle they cut the thighbones out they wrapped them round in fat a double fold sliced clean an d topped with strips of ﬂesh and since they had no wine to anoint the glowing victims they made libations with water broiling all the innards and once they’d burned the bones and tasted the organs— hacked the rest into pieces piercing them with spits that moment soothing slumber fell from my eyes and down i went to our ship at the water’s edge but on my way nearing the long beaked craft the smoky savor of roasts came ﬂoating up around me … i groaned in anguish crying out to the deathless gods ‘father zeus the rest of you blissful gods who never die— you with your fatal sleep you lulled me into disaster left on their own look what a monstrous thing my crew concocted’ quick as a ﬂash with her ﬂaring robes lampetie sped the news to the sun on high that we had killed his herds and helios burst out in rage to all the immortals ‘father zeus the rest of you blissful gods who never die— punish them all that crew of laertes’ son odysseus— what an outrage they they killed my cattle the great joy of my heart … day in day out when i climbed the starry skies and when i wheeled back down from the heights to touch the earth once more unless they pay me back in blood for the butchery of my herds down i go to the house of death and blaze among the dead’ but zeus who marshals the thunderheads insisted ‘sun you keep on shining among the deathless gods and mortal men across the good green earth and as for the guilty ones why soon enough on the winedark sea i’ll hit their racing ship with a whitehot bolt i’ll tear it into splinters’ —or so i heard from the lovely nymph calypso who heard it herself she said from hermes god of guides as soon as i reached our ship at the water’s edge i took the men to task upbraiding each in turn but how to set things right we couldn’t ﬁnd a way the cattle were dead already … and the gods soon showed us all some fateful signs— the hides began to crawl the meat both raw and roasted bellowed out on the spits and we heard a noise like the moan of lowing oxen ye t s i x m o r e d a y s my eager companions feasted on the cattle of the sun the pick of the herds they’d driven off but then when cronian zeus brought on the seventh day the wind in its ceaseless raging dropped at last and stepping the mast at once hoisting the white sail we boarded ship and launched her made for open sea but once we’d left that island in our wake— no land at all in sight nothing but sea and sky— then zeus the son of cronus mounted a thunderhead above our hollow ship and the deep went black beneath it nor did the craft scud on much longer all of a sudden killersqualls attacked us screaming out of the west a murderous blast shearing the two forestays off so the mast toppled backward its running tackle spilling into the bilge the mast itself went crashing into the stern it struck the helmsman’s head and crushed his skull to pulp and down from his deck the man ﬂipped like a diver— his hardy life spirit left his bones behind then then in the same breath zeus hit the craft with a lightningbolt and thunder round she spun reeling under the impact ﬁlled with reeking brimstone shipmates pitching out of her bobbing round like seahawks swept along by the whitecaps past the trim black hull— and the god cut short their journey home forever but i went lurching along our battered hulk till the seasurge ripped the plankings from the keel and the waves swirled it away stripped bare and snapped the mast from the decks—but a backstay made of bull’shide still held fast and with this i lashed the mast and keel together made them one riding my makeshift raft as the wretched galewinds bore me on and on at last the west wind quit its wild rage but the south came on at once to hound me even more making me double back my route toward cruel charybdis all night long i was rushed back and then at break of day i reached the crag of scylla and dire charybdis’ vortex right when the dreadful whirlpool gulped the salt sea down but heaving myself aloft to clutch at the ﬁgtree’s height like a bat i clung to its trunk for dear life—not a chance for a good ﬁrm foothold there no clambering up it either the roots too far to reach the boughs too high overhead huge swaying branches that overshadowed charybdis but i held on dead set … waiting for her to vomit my mast and keel back up again— oh how i ached for both and back they came late but at last at just the hour a judge at court who’s settled the countless suits of brash young claimants rises the day’s work done and turns home for supper— that’s when the timbers reared back up from charybdis i let go—i plunged with my hands and feet ﬂailing crashing into the waves beside those great beams and scrambling aboard them fast i rowed hard with my hands right through the straits … and the father of men and gods did not let scylla see me else i’d have died on the spot—no escape from death i drifted along nine days on the tenth at night the gods cast me up on ogygia calypso’s island home of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids who speaks with human voice and she took me in she loved me … why cover the same ground again just yesterday here at hall i told you all the rest you and your gracious wife it goes against my grain to repeat a tale told once and told so clearly” book xiii ithaca at last his tale was over now the phae acians all fell silent hushed his story holding them spellbound down the shadowed halls until alcinous found the poise to say “odysseus now that you have come to my bronzeﬂoored house my vaulted roofs i know you won’t be driven off your course nothing can hold you back— however much you’ve suffered you’ll sail home here friends here’s a command for one and all you who frequent my palace day and night and drink the shining wine of kings and enjoy the harper’s songs the robes and hammered gold and a haul of other gifts you lords of our island council brought our guest— all lie packed in his polished seachest now come each of us add a sumptuous tripod add a cauldron then recover our costs with levies on the people it’s hard to afford such bounty man by man” the king’s instructions met with warm applause and home they went to sleep each in his own house when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more they hurried down to the ship with handsome bronze gifts and striding along the decks the ardent king alcinous stowed them under the benches shipshape so nothing could foul the crewmen tugging at their oars then back the party went to alcinous’ house and shared a royal feast the majestic king slaughtered an ox for them to cronus’ mighty son zeus of the thundercloud whose power rules the world they burned the thighs and fell to the lordly banquet reveling there while in their midst the inspired bard struck up a song demodocus prized by all the people true but time and again odysseus turned his face toward the radiant sun anxious for it to set yearning now to be gone and home once more … as a man aches for his evening meal when all day long his brace of winedark oxen have dragged the bolted plowshare down a fallow ﬁeld—how welcome the setting sun to him the going home to supper yes though his knees buckle struggling home at last so welcome now to odysseus the setting light of day and he lost no time as he pressed phaeacia’s men who love their oars addressing his host alcinous ﬁrst and foremost “a l c i n o u s m a j e s t y s h i n i n g a m o n g y o u r i s l a n d p e o p l e make your libations launch me safely on my way— to one and all farewell all is now made good my heart’s desire your convoy home your precious loving gifts and may the gods of olympus bless them for me may i ﬁnd an unswerving wife when i reach home and loved ones hale unharmed and you my friends remaining here in your kingdom now may you delight in your loyal wives and children may the gods rain down all kinds of fortune on your lives misfortune never harbor in your homeland” all burst into applause urging passage home for their parting guest his farewell rang so true hallowed king alcinous briskly called his herald “come pontonous mix the wine in the bowl pour rounds to all our banqueters in the house so we with a prayer to mighty zeus the father can sail our new friend home to native land” pontonous mixed the heady honeyed wine and hovering closely poured full rounds for all and from where they sat they tipped libations out to the happy gods who rule the vaulting skies then king odysseus rose up from his seat and placing his twoeared cup in arete’s hands addressed the queen with parting wishes on the wing “y our health my queen through all your days to come— until old age and death that visit all mankind pay you a visit too now i am on my way but you may you take joy in this house of yours in your children your people in alcinous the king” with that the great odysseus strode across the threshold and king alcinous sent the herald off with the guest to lead him down to the swift ship and foaming surf and arete sent her servingwomen one to carry a seacloak washed and fresh a shirt as well another assigned to bear the sturdy chest and a third to take the bread and ruddy wine when they reached the ship at the water’s edge the royal escorts took charge of the gifts at once and stores of food and wine stowed them deep in the holds and then for their guest they spread out rug and sheets on the halfdeck clear astern on the ship’s hull so he might sleep there soundly undisturbed and last odysseus climbed aboard himself and down he lay all quiet as crewmen sat to the oarlocks each in line they slipped the cable free of the drilled stone post and soon as they swung back and the blades tossed up the spray an irresistible sleep fell deeply on his eyes the sweetest soundest oblivion still as the sleep of death itself … and the ship like a fourhorse team careering down the plain all breaking as one with the whiplash cracking smartly leaping with hoofs high to run the course in no time— so the stern hove high and plunged with the seething rollers crashing dark in her wake as on she surged unwavering never ﬂagging no not even a darting hawk the quickest thing on wings could keep her pace as on she ran cutting the swells at top speed bearing a man equipped with the gods’ own wisdom one who had suffered twenty years of torment sick at heart cleaving his way through wars of men and pounding waves at sea but now he slept in peace the memory of his struggles laid to rest and then that hour the star rose up the clearest brightest star that always heralds the newborn light of day the deepseagoing ship made landfall on the isla nd … ithaca at last there on the coast a haven lies named for phorcys the old god of the deep—with two jutting headlands sheared off at the seaward side but shelving toward the bay that break the great waves whipped by the gales outside so within the harbor ships can ride unmoored whenever they come in mooring range of shore at the harbor’s head a branching olive stands with a welcome cave nearby it dank with seamist sacred to nymphs of the springs we call the naiads there are mixingbowls inside and doublehandled jars crafted of stone and bees store up their honey in the hollows there are long stone looms as well where the nymphs weave out their webs from clouds of sea blue wool—a marvelous sight— and a wellspring ﬂows forever the cave has two ways in one facing the north wind a pathway down for mortals the other facing the south belongs to the gods no man may go that way … it is the path for all the deathless powers here at this bay the phaeacian crew put in— they’d known it long before—driving the ship so hard she ran up onto the beach for a good half her length such way the oarsmen’s brawny arms had made up from the benches swinging down to land ﬁrst they lifted odysseus off the decks— linen and lustrous carpet too—and laid him down on the sand asleep still dead to the world then hoisted out the treasures proud phaeacians urged by openhearted pallas had lavished on him setting out for home they heaped them all by the olive’s trunk in a neat pile clear of the road for fear some passerby might spot and steal odysseus’ hoard before he could awaken then pushing off they pulled for home themselves but now poseidon god of the earthquake never once forgetting the ﬁrst threats he leveled at the hero probed almighty zeus to learn his plans in full “zeus father i will lose all my honor now among the immortals now there are mortal men who show me no respect—phaeacians too born of my own loins i said myself that odysseus would suffer long and hard before he made it home but i never dreamed of blocking his return not absolutely at least once you had pledged your word and bowed your head but now they’ve swept him across the sea in their swift ship they’ve set him down in ithaca sound asleep and loaded the man with boundless gifts—bronze and hoards of gold and robes— aye more plunder than he could ever have won from troy if odysseus had returned intact with his fair share” “incredible” zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied “earthshaker you with your massive power why moaning so the gods don’t disrespect you what a stir there’d be if they ﬂung abuse at the oldest noblest of them all those mortals if any man so lost in his strength and prowess pays you no respect—just pay him back the power is always yours do what you like whatever warms your heart” “king of the dark cloud” the earthquake god agreed “i’d like to avenge myself at once as you advise but i’ve always feared your wrath and shied away but now i’ll crush that ﬁne phaeacian cutter out on the misty sea now on her homeward run from the latest convoy they will learn at last to cease and desist from escorting every man alive— i’ll pile a huge mountain round about their port” “wait dear brother” zeus who collects the clouds had second thoughts “here’s what seems best to me as the people all lean down from the city heights to watch her speeding home strike her into a rock that looks like a racing vessel just offshore— amaze all men with a marvel for the ages then pile your huge mountain round about their port” hearing that from zeus the god of the earthquake sped to scheria now the phaeacians’ island home and waited there till the ship came sweeping in scudding lightly along—and surging close abreast the earthquake god with one ﬂat stroke of his hand struck her to stone rooted her to the ocean ﬂoor and made for open sea the phaeacians aghast those lords of the long oars the master mariners traded startled glances sudden outcries “look—who’s pinned our swift ship to the sea” “just racing for home” “just hove into plain view” they might well wonder blind to what had happened till alcinous rose and made things all too clear “oh no—my father’s prophecy years ago … it all comes home to me with a vengeance now he’d say poseidon was vexed with us because we escorted all mankind and never came to grief he said that one day as a wellbuilt ship of ours sailed home on the misty sea from such a convoy the god would crush it yes and pile a huge mountain round about our port so the old king foretold now look it all comes true hurry friends do as i say let us all comply stop our convoys home for every castaway chancing on our city as for poseidon sacriﬁce twelve bulls to the god at once— the pick of the herds perhaps he’ll pity us pile no looming mountain ridge around our port” the people terriﬁed prepared the bulls at once so all of phaeacia’s island lords and captains milling round the altar lifted prayers to poseidon master of the sea … that very moment great odysseus woke from sleep on native ground at last— he’d been away for years—but failed to know the land for the goddess pallas athena zeus’s daughter showered mist over all so under cover she might change his appearance head to foot as she told him every peril he’d meet at home— keep him from being known by wife townsmen friends till the suitors paid the price for all their outrage and so to the king himself all ithaca looked strange … the winding beaten paths the coves where ships can ride the steep rock face of the cliffs and the tall leafy trees he sprang to his feet and scanning his own native country groaned slapped his thighs with his ﬂat palms and odysseus cried in anguish “man of misery whose land have i lit on now what are they here—violent savage lawless or friendly to strangers godfearing men where can i take this heap of treasure now and where in the world do i wander off myself if only the trove had stayed among the phaeacians there and i had made my way to some other mighty king who would have hosted me well and sent me home but now i don’t know where to stow all this and i can’t leave it here inviting any bandit to rob me blind so damn those lords and captains those phaeacians not entirely honest or upright were they sweeping me off to this this noman’sland and they they swore they’d sail me ho me to sunny ithaca—well they never kept their word zeus of the suppliants pay them back—he keeps an eye on the world of men and punishes all transgressors come quickly i’ll inspect my treasure and count it up myself did they make off with an ything in their ship” with that he counted up the gorgeous tripods cauldrons bars of gold and the lovely woven robes not a stitch was missing from the lot but still he wept for his native country trailing down the shore where the wash of sea on shingle ebbs and ﬂows his homesick heart in turmoil but now athena appeared and came toward him she looked like a young man … a shepherd boy yet elegant too with all the gift s that grace the sons of kings with a wellcut cloak falling in folds across her shoulders sandals under her shining feet a hunting spear in hand odysseus overjoyed at the sight went up to meet her joining her now with salutations on the wing “greetings friend since you are the ﬁrst i’ve come on in this harbor treat me kindly— no cruelty please save these treasures save me too i pray to you like a god i fall before your knees and ask your mercy and tell me this for a fact—i need to know— where on earth am i what land who lives here is it one of the sunny islands or some jutting shore of the good green mainland slanting down to sea” athena answered her eyes brightening now “y ou must be a fool stranger or come from nowhere if you really have to ask what land this is trust me it’s not so nameless after all it’s known the world around to all who live to the east and rising sun and to all who face the western mists and darkness it’s a rugged land too cramped for driving horses but though it’s far from broad it’s hardly poor there’s plenty of grain for bread grapes for wine the rains never fail and the dewfall’s healthy good country for goats good for cattle too— there’s stand on stand of timber and water runs in streambeds through the year so stranger the name of ithaca’s reached as far as troy and troy they say is a long hard sail from greece” ithaca … heart racing odysseus that great exile ﬁlled with joy to hear athena daughter of storming zeus pronounce that name he stood on native ground at last and he replied with a winging word to pallas not with a word of truth—he choked it back always invoking the cunning in his heart “ithaca … yes i seem to have heard of ithaca even on crete’s broad island far across the sea and now i’ve reached it myself with all this loot but i left behind an equal measure for my children i’m a fugitive now you see i killed idomeneus’ son orsilochus lightning on his legs a man who beat all runners alive on that long island—what a racer he tried to rob me of all the spoil i’d won at troy the plunder i went to hell and back to capture true cleaving my way through wars of men and waves at sea— and just because i refused to please his father serve under him at troy i led my own command so now with a friend i lay in wait by the road i killed him just loping in from the ﬁelds— with one quick stroke of my bronze spear in the dead of night the heavens pitchblack … no one could see us spot me tearing out his life with a weapon honed for action once i’d cut him down i made for a ship and begged the phoenician crew for mercy paying those decent hands a hearty share of plunder— asked them to take me on and land me down in pylos there or lovely elis where epeans rule in power but a heavy galewind blew them way off course much against their will— they’d no desire to cheat me driven afar we reached this island here at the midnight hour rowing for dear life we made it into your harbor— not a thought of supper much as we all craved food we dropped from the decks and lay down just like that a welcome sleep came over my weary bones at once while the crew hoisted up my loot from the holds and set it down on the sand near where i slept they reembarked now homeward bound for sidon their own noble city leaving me here behind homesick in my heart …” as his story ended goddess athena gray eyes gleaming broke into a smile and stroked him with her hand and now she appeared a woman beautiful tall and skilled at weaving lovely things her words went ﬂying straight toward odysseus “a n y m a n — a n y g o d w h o m e t y o u — w o u l d h a v e t o b e some champion lying cheat to get past you for allround craft and guile y ou terrible man foxy ingenious never tired of twists and tricks— so not even here on native soil would you give up those wily tales that warm the cockles of your heart come enough of this now we’re both old hands at the arts of intrigue here among mortal men you’re far the best at tactics spinning yarns and i am famous among the gods for wisdom cunning wiles too ah but you never recognized me did you pallas athena daughter of zeus—who always stands beside you shields you in every exploit thanks to me the phaeacians all embraced you warmly and now i am here once more to weave a scheme with you and to hide the treasuretrove phaeacia’s nobles lavished on you then—i willed it planned it so when you set out for home—and to tell you all the trials you must suffer in your palace … endure them all y ou must y ou have no choice and to no one—no man no woman not a soul— reveal that you are the wanderer home at last no in silence you must bear a world of pain subject yourself to the cruel abuse of men” “a h g o d d e s s ” t h e c o o l t a c t i c i a n c o u n t e r e d “you’re so hard for a mortal man to know on sight however shrewd he is—the shapes you take are endless but i do know this you were kind to me in the war years so long as we men of achaea soldiered on at troy but once we’d sacked king priam’s craggy city boarded ship and a god dispersed the ﬂeet from then on daughter of zeus i never saw you never glimpsed you striding along my decks to ward off some disaster no i wandered on my heart forever torn to pieces inside my chest till the gods released me from my miseries at last that day in the fertile kingdom of phaeacia when you cheered me with words in person led me to their city but now i beg you by your almighty father’s name … for i can’t believe i’ve reached my sunny ithaca i must be roaming around one more exotic land— you’re mocking me i know it telling me tales to make me lose my way tell me the truth now have i really reached the land i love” “a l w a y s t h e s a m e y o u r w a r y t u r n o f m i n d ” athena exclaimed her glances ﬂashing warmly “that’s why i can’t forsake you in your troubles— you are so winning so worldlywise so selfpossessed anyone else come back from wandering long and hard would have hurried home at once delighted to see his children and his wife oh but not you it’s not your pleasure to probe for news of them— you must put your wife to the proof yourself but she she waits in your halls as always her life an endless hardship … wasting away the nights weeping away the days i never had doubts myself no i knew down deep that you would return at last with all your shipmates lost but i could not bring myself to ﬁght my father’s brother poseidon quaking with anger at you still enraged because you blinded the cyclops his dear son but come let me show you ithaca’s setting i’ll convince you this haven—look around— it’s named for phorcys the old god of the deep and here at the harbor’s head the branching olive stands with the welcome cave nearby it dank with seamist sacred to nymphs of the springs we call the naiads here under its arching vault time and again you’d offer the nymphs a generous sacriﬁce to bring success and the slopes above you look mount neriton decked in forests” at those words the goddess scattered the mist and the country stood out clear and the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last thrilled to see his ithaca—kissed the good green earth and raised his hands to the nymphs and prayed at once “nymphs of the springs naiads daughters of zeus i never dreamed i would see you yet again … now rejoice in my loving prayers—and later just like the old days i will give you gifts if athena zeus’s daughter queen of armies comes to my rescue grants this ﬁghter life and brings my son to manhood” “courage”— goddess athena answered eyes aﬁre— “free your mind of all that anguish now come quick let’s bury your treasures here in some recess of this haunted hallowed cave where they’ll be safe and sound then we’ll make plans so we can win the day” with that the goddess swept into the cavern’s shadowed vault searching for hidingplaces far inside its depths while odysseus hauled his treasures closer up the gold durable bronze and ﬁnespun robes the phaeacians’ parting gifts once he’d stowed them well away the goddess pallas athena daughter of storming zeus sealed the mouth of the cavern with a stone then down they sat by the sacred olive’s trunk to plot the death of the high and mighty suitors the brighteyed goddess athena led the way “royal son of laertes odysseus old campaigner think how to lay your hands on all those brazen suitors lording it over your hous e now three whole years courting your noble wife offering gifts to win her but she forever brokenhearted for your return builds up each man’s hopes— dangling promises dropping hints to each— but all the while with something else in mind” “god help me” the man of intrigue broke out “clearly i might have died the same ignoble death as agamemnon bled white in my own house too if you had never revealed this to me now goddess blowbyblow come weave us a scheme so i can pay them back yo u s t a n d b e s i d e m e ﬁ r e m e w i t h d a r i n g ﬁ e r c e as the day we ripped troy’s glittering crown of towers down stand by me—furious now as then my brighteyed one— and i would ﬁght three hundred men great goddess with you to brace me comradeinarms in battle” gray eyes ablaze the goddess urged him on “surely i’ll stand beside you not forget you not when the day arrives for us to do our work those men who court your wi fe and waste your goods i have a feeling some will splatter your ample ﬂoors with all their blood and brains up now quickly first i will transform you—no one must know you i will shrivel the supple skin on your lithe limbs strip the russet curls from your head and deck you out in rags you’d hate to see some other mortal wear i’ll dim the ﬁre in your eyes so shining once— until you seem appalling to all those suitors even your wife and son you left behind at home but you you make your way to the swineherd ﬁrst in charge of your pigs and true to you as always loyal friend to your son to penelope so selfpossessed yo u ’ l l ﬁ n d h i m p o s t e d b e s i d e h i s s w i n e g r u b b i n g r o u n d by raven’s rock and the spring called arethusa rooting for feed that makes pigs sleek and fat the nuts they love the dark pools they drink wait there sit with him ask him all he knows i’m off to sparta where the women are a wonder to call telemachus home your own dear son odysseus he’s journeyed to lacedaemon’s rolling hills to see menelaus questing for news of you hoping to learn if you are still alive” shrewd odysseus answered her at once “why not tell him the trut h y ou know it all or is he too—like father like son—condemned to hardship roving over the barren salt sea while strangers devour our livelihood right here” but the brighteyed goddess reassured him ﬁrmly “no need for anguish trust me not for him — i escorted your son myself so he might make his name by sailing there nor is he saddled down with any troubles now he sits at ease in the halls of menelaus bathed in endless bounty … true enough some young lords in a black cutter lurk in ambush poised to kill the prince before he reaches home but i have my doubts they will sooner the earth will swallow down a few of those young gallants who eat you out of house and home these days” no more words not now— athena stroked odysseus with her wand she shriveled the supple skin on his lithe limbs stripped the russet curls from his head covered his body top to toe with the wrinkled hide of an old man and dimmed the ﬁre in his eyes so shining once she turned his shirt and cloak into squalid rags ripped and ﬁlthy smeared with grime and soot she ﬂung over this the long pelt of a bounding deer rubbed bare and gave him a staff and beggar’s sack torn and tattered slung from a fraying rope all plans made they went their separate ways—athena setting off to bring telemachus home from hallowed lacedaemon book xiv the loyal swineherd so up from the haven now odysseus climbed a rugged path through timber along high grou nd—athena had shown the way— to reach the swineherd’s place that ﬁne loyal man who of all the household hands odysseus ever had cared the most for his master’s worldly goods sitting at the door of his lodge he found him there in his farmstead highwalled broad and large with its long view on its cleared rise of ground … the swineherd made those walls with his own hands to enclose the pigs of his master gone for years alone apart from his queen or old laertes he’d built them up of qu arried blocks of stone and coped them well with a fence of wild pear outside he’d driven stakes in a longline stockade a ring of thickset palings split from an oak’s dark heart within the yard he’d built twelve sties sidebyside to bed his pigs and in each one ﬁfty broodsows slept aground penned and kept for breeding the boars slept outside but far fewer of them thanks to the lordly suitors’ feasts that kept on thinning the herd and kept the swineherd stepping sending to town each day the best fat hog in sight by now they were down to three hundred and sixty head but guarding them all the time were dogs like savage beasts a pack of four reared by the swineherd foreman of men the man himself was ﬁtting sandals to his feet carving away at an oxhide dark and supple as for his men three were off with their pigs herding them here or there under orders he’d sent a fourth to town with hog in tow for the gorging suitors to slaughter off and glut themselves with pork suddenly—those snarling dogs spotted odysseus charged him fast—a shatter of barks—but odysseus sank to the ground at once he knew the trick the staff dropped from his hand but here and now on his own farm he might have taken a shameful mauling ye s b u t t h e s w i n e h e r d q u i c k t o m o v e d a s h e d f o r t h e g a t e ﬂinging his oxhide down rush ed the dogs with curses scattered them left and right with ﬂying rocks and warned his master “lucky to be alive old man— a moment more my pack would have torn you limb from limb then you’d have covered me with shame as if the gods had never given me blows and groans aplenty … here i sit my heart aching broken for him my master my great king—fattening up his own hogs for other men to eat while he starving for food i wager wanders the earth a beggar adrift in strangers’ cities foreignspeaking lands if he’s still alive that is still sees the rising sun come follow me into my place old man so you at least can eat your ﬁll of bread and wine then you can tell me where you’re from and all the pains you’ve weathered” on that note the loyal swineherd led the way to his shelter showed his guest inside and sat odysseus down on brush and twigs he piled up for the visitor ﬂinging over these the skin of a shaggy wild goat broad and soft the swineherd’s own good bedding the king delighted to be so well received thanked the man at once “my host—may zeus and the other gods give you your heart’s desire for the royal welcome you have shown me here” and you replied eumaeus loyal swineherd “it’s wrong my friend to send any stranger packing— even one who arrives in worse shape than you every stranger and beggar comes from zeus and whatever scrap they get from the likes of us they’ll ﬁnd it welcome that’s the best we can do we servants always cowed by our high and mighty masters especially our young lords … but my old master the gods they must have blocked his journey home he’d have treated me well he would with a house a plot of land and a wife you’d gladly prize goods that a kind lord will give a household hand who labors for him hard whose work the gods have sped just as they speed the work i labor at all day my master i tell you would have repaid me well if he’d grown old right here but now he’s dead … if only helen and all her kind had died out too brought to her knees just as she cut the legs from under troops of men my king among them he went off to the stallionland of troy to ﬁght the trojans save agamemnon’s honor” enough— he brusquely cinched his belt around his shirt strode out to the pens crammed with droves of pigs picked out two bundled them in and slaughtered both singed them sliced them down skewered them through and roasting all to a turn set them before odysseus sizzling hot on the spits then coating the meat with white barley groats and mixing honeyed wine in a carved wooden bowl he sat down across from his guest inviting warmly “eat up now my friend it’s all we slaves have got scrawny pork while the suitors eat the fatted hogs— no fear of the gods in their hard hearts no mercy trust me the blessed gods have no love for crime they honor justice honor the decent acts of men even cutthroat bandits who raid foreign parts— and zeus grants them a healthy share of plunder ships ﬁlled to the brim and back they head for home— even their dark hearts are stal ked by the dread of vengeance but the suitors know they’ve caught some godsent rumor of master’s grisly death that’s why they have no mind to do their courting fairly or go back home in peace no at their royal ease they devour all his goods those brazen rascals never spare a scrap not a day or a night goes by sent down by zeus but they butcher victims never stopping at one or two and drain his wine as if there’s no tomorrow— swilling the last drop … believe me my master’s wealth was vast no other prince on earth could match his riches not on the loamy mainland or here at home in ithaca— no twenty men in the world could equal his great treasures let me count them off for yo u a dozen herds of cattle back on the mainland just as many head of sheep as many droves of pigs and goatﬂocks ranging free hired hands or his own herdsmen keep them grazing there here in ithaca goatﬂocks eleven in all scatter to graze the island out at the wild end and trusty goatherds watch their every move and each herdsman day after day it never ends drives in a beast for the suitors—best in sight a sheep or wellfed goat while i tend to these pigs i guard them pick the best for those carousers and send it to the slaughter” his voice rose while the stranger ate his meat and drank his wine ravenous bolting it all down in silence … brooding on ways to serve the suitors right but once he’d supped and refreshed himself with food he ﬁlled the wooden bowl he’d been drinking from brimmed it with wine and passed it to his host who received the offer gladly spirit cheered as the stranger probed him now with winging words “friend who was the man who bought you with his goods the master of such vast riches powerful as you say yo u t e l l m e h e d i e d d e f e n d i n g a g a m e m n o n’s h o n o r what’s his name i just might know such a man … zeus would know and the other deathless gods if i ever saw him if i bring you any news i’ve roamed the whole earth over” and the good swineherd answered foreman of men “old friend no wanderer landing here with news of him is likely to win his wife and dear son over random drifters hungry for bed and board lie through their teeth and swallow back the truth why any tramp washed up on ithaca’s shores scurries right to my mistress babbling lies and she ushers him in kindly pressing for details and the warm tears of grief come trickling down her cheeks the loyal wife’s way when her husband’s died abroad even you old codger could rig up some ﬁne tale— and soon enough i’d say if they gave you shirt and clothing for your pains my master well no doubt the dogs and wheeling birds have ripped the skin from his ribs by now his life is through— or ﬁsh have picked him clean at sea and the man’s bones lie piled up on the mainland buried deep in sand … he’s dead and gone aye leaving a broken heart for loved ones left behind for me most of all never another master kind as he i’ll never ﬁnd one—no matter where i go not even if i went back to mother and father the house where i was born and my parents reared me once ah but much as i grieve for them much as i long to lay my eyes on them set foot on the old soil it’s longing for him him that wrings my heart— odysseus lost and gone that man old friend far away as he is … i can scarcely bear to say his name aloud so deeply he loved me cared for me so deeply worlds away as he is i call him master brother” “my friend” the great odysseus long in exile answered “since you are dead certain since you still insist he’s never coming back still the soul of denial i won’t simply say it—on my oath i swear odysseus is on his way reward for such good news let me have it the moment he sets foot in his own house dress me in shirt and cloak in handsome clothes before then poor as i am i wouldn’t take a thing i hate that man like the very gates of death who ground down by poverty stoops to peddling lies i swear by zeus the ﬁrst of all the gods by this table of hospitality here my host by odysseus’ hearth where i have come for help all will come to pass i swear exactly as i say true this very month—just as the old moon dies and the new moon rises into life—odysseus will return he will come home and take revenge on any man who offends his wedded wife and princely son” “good news” you replied eumaeus loyal swineherd “but i will never pay a reward for that old friend— odysseus he’ll never come home again never … drink your wine sit back let’s talk of other things don’t remind me of all this the heart inside me breaks when anyone mentions my dear master that oath of yours we’ll let it pass— odysseus oh come back— just as i wish i and penelope old laertes too telemachus too the godlike boy how i grieve for him now i can’t stop—odysseus’ son telemachus the gods reared him up like a ﬁne young tree and i often said ‘in the ranks of men he’ll match his father his own dear father—amazing in build and looks that boy’ but all of a sudden a god wrecks his sense of balance— god or man no matter—off he’s gone to catch some news of his father down to holy pylos and now those gallant suitors lie in wait for him sailing home to tear the royal line of arcesius out of ithaca root and branch good name and all enough let him pass too—whether he’s trapped or the hand of zeus will pull him through alive come old soldier tell me the story of your troubles tell me truly too i’d like to know it well … who are you where are you from your city your parents what sort of vessel brought you why did the sailors land you here in ithaca who did they say they are i hardly think you came this way on foot” the great teller of tales returned at length “my story—the whole truth—i’m glad to tell it all if only the two of us had food and mellow wine to last us long here in your shelter now for us to sup on undisturbed while others take the work of the world in hand i could easily spend all year and never reach the end of my endless story all the heartbreaking trials i struggled through the gods willed it so … i hail from crete’s broad land i’m proud to say and i am a rich man’s son and many other sons he brought up in his palace born in wedlock sprung of his lawful wife unlike my mother she was a slave a concubine he’d purchased yes but he treated me on a par with all his trueborn sons— castor hylax’ son i’m proud to boast his blood that man revered like a god throughout all crete those days for wealth power and all his glorious offspring but the deadly spirits soon swept him down to the house of death and his high and mighty sons carved up his lands and then cast lots for the parts and gave me just a pittance a paltry house as well but i won myself a wife from wealthy landed people thanks to my own strong points i was no fool and never shirked a ﬁght but now my heyday’s gone— i’ve had my share of blows y et look hard at the husk and you’ll still see i think the grain that gave it life by heaven ares gave me courage athena too to break the ranks of men wide open once in the old days whenever i picked my troops and formed an ambush plotting attacks to spring against our foes— no hint of death could daunt my ﬁghting spirit far out of the front i’d charge and spear my man i’d cut down any enemy soldier backing off such was i in battle true but i had no love for working the land the chores of households either the labor that raises crops of shining children no it was always oarswept ship s that thrilled my heart and wars and the long polished spears and arrows dreadful gear that makes the next man cringe i loved them all—god planted that love inside me each man delights in the work that suits him best why long before we acha eans ever camped at troy nine commands i led in our deepseagoing ships raiding foreign men and a ﬁne haul reached my hands i helped myself to the lion’s share and still more came by lot and my house grew by leaps and bounds i walked among the cretans honored feared as well but then when thundering zeus contrived that expedition— that disaster that brought so many ﬁghters to their knees— and men kept pressing me and renowned idomeneus to head a ﬂeet to troy there was no way out no denying them then the voice of the people bore down much too hard so nine whole years we achaeans soldiered on at troy in the tenth we sacked king priam’s city then embarked for home in the long ships and a god dispersed the ﬂeet unlucky me shrewd old zeus was plotting still more pain no more than a month i stayed at home taking joy in my children loyal wife and lovely plunder but a spirit in me urged ‘set sail for egypt— ﬁt out ships take crews of seasoned heroes’ nine i ﬁtted out the men joined up at once and then six days my shipmates feasted well while i provided a ﬂock of sheep to offer up to the gods and keep the feasters’ table groaning on the seventh we launched out from the plains of crete with a stiff north wind fair astern—smooth sailing aye like coasting on downstream … and not one craft in our squadron foundered all shipshape and all hands sound we sat back while the wind and helmsmen kept us true on course five days out and we raised the great river nile and there in the nile delta moored our ships of war god knows i ordered my trusty crews to stand by just where they were and guard the anchored ﬂeet and i sent a patrol to scout things out from higher ground but swept away by their own reckless fury the crew went berserk— they promptly began to plunder the lush egyptian farms dragged off the women and children killed the men outcries reached the city in no time—stirred by shouts the entire town came streaming down at the break of day ﬁlling the river plain with chariots ranks of infantry and the gleam of bronze zeus who loves the lightning ﬂung down murderous panic on all my menatarms— no one dared to stand his ground and ﬁght disaster ringed us round from every quarter droves of my men they hacked down with swords led off the rest alive to labor for them as slaves and i zeus ﬂashed an inspiration through my mind though i wish i’d died a soldier down in egypt then a world of pain you see still lay in wait for me … quickly i wrenched the skullcap helmet off my head i tore the shield from my back and dropped my spear and ran right into the path of the king’s chariot hugged and kissed his knees he pitied me spared me hoisted me onto his warcar took me home in tears troops of his men came rushin g after shaking javelins mad to kill me—their ﬁghting blood at the boil— but their master drove them off he feared the wrath of zeus the god of guests the ﬁrst of the gods to pay back acts of outrage so there i lingered for seven years amassing a fortune from all the egyptian people loading me with gifts then at last when the eighth had come full turn along comes this phoenician one ﬁne day … a scoundrel swindler an old hand at lies who’d already done the world a lot of damage well he smoothly talked me round and off we sailed phoeniciabound where his house and holdings lay there in his care i stayed till the year was out then when the months and days had run their course and the year wheeled round and the seasons came again he conned me aboard his freighter bound for libya pretending i’d help him ship a cargo there for sale but in fact he’d sell me there and make a killing i suspected as much of course but had no choice so i boarded with him yes and the ship ran on with a good strong north wind gusting— fast on the middle passage clear of crete— but zeus was brewing mischief for that crew … once we’d left the island in our wake— no land at all in sight nothing but sea and sky— then zeus the son of cronus mounted a thunderhead above our hollow ship and the deep went black beneath it then then in the same breath zeus hit the craft with a lightningbolt and thunder round she spun reeling under the impact ﬁlled with reeking brimstone shipmates pitching out of her bobbing round like seahawks swept along by the breakers past the trim black hull— and the god cut short their journey home forever not mine zeus himself—when i was just at the ﬁnal gasp— thrust the huge mast of my darkprowed vessel right into my arms so i might ﬂee disaster one more time wrapping myself around it i was borne along by the wretched galewinds rushed along nine days—on the tenth at dead of night a shouldering breaker rolled me up along thesprotia’s beaches there the king of thesprotia phidon my salvation treated me kindly asked for no reward at all his own good son had found me halfdead from exhaustion and the cold he raised me up by the hand and led me home to his father’s house and dressed me in cloak and shirt and decent clothes that’s where i ﬁrst got wind of him —odysseus … the king told me he’d hosted the man in style befriended him on his way home to native land and showed me all the treasure odysseus had amassed bronze and gold and plenty of hard wrought iron enough to last a man and ten generations of his heirs— so great the wealth stored up for him in the king’s vaults but odysseus he made clear was off at dodona then to hear the will of zeus that rustles forth from the god’s tall leafy oak how should he return after all the years away to hi s own green land of ithaca— openly or in secret phidon swore to me what’s more as the princely man poured out libations in his house the ship’s hauled down and the crew set to sail to take odysseus home to native land’ but i … he shipped me off before a thesprotian cutter chanced to be heading for dulichion rich in wheat so he told the crew to take me to the king acastus treat me kindly too but it pleased them more to scheme foul play against me sink me into the very depths of pain as soon as the ship was far off land scudding in midsea they sprang their trap—my day of slavery then and there they stripped from my back the shirt and cloak i wore decked me out in a new suit of clothes all rags ripped and ﬁlthy—the rags you see right now but then once they’d gained the ﬁelds of ithaca still clear in the evening light they lashed me fast to the rowingbenches twisting a cable round me all hands went ashore and rushed to catch their supper on the beach but the gods themselves unhitched my knots at once with the gods’ own ease i wrapped my head in rags slid down the gangplank polished smooth slipped my body into the water not a splash chesthigh then quick launched out with both my arms and swam away— out of the surf in no time clear of the crew i clambered upland into a ﬂowery fragrant brush and crouched there huddling low they raised a hue and cry wildly beat the bushes but when it seemed no use to pursue the hunt back they trudged again and boarded their empty ship the gods hid me themselves— it’s light work for them—and brought me here the homestead of a man who knows the world so it seems to be my lot that i’ll live on” and you replied eumaeus loyal swineherd “so much misery friend y ou’ve moved my heart deeply with your long tale … such blows such roving but one part’s off the mark i know—you’ll never persuade me— what you say about odysseus a man in your condition who are you i ask you to lie for no good reason well i know the truth of my good lord’s return how the gods detested him with a vengeance— never letting him go under ﬁghting trojans or die in the arms of loved ones once he’d wound down the long coil of war then all united achaea would have raised his tomb and he’d have won his son great fame for years to come but now the whirlwinds have ripped him away—no fame for him and i live here cut off from the world with all my pigs i never go into town unless perhaps wise penelope calls me back when news drops in from nowhere there they crowd the messenger crossexamine him heartsick for their longlost lord or all too glad to eat him out of house and home scotfree but i’ve no love for all that probing prying not since some aetolian fooled me with his yarn he’d killed a man wandered over the face of the earth stumbled onto my hut and i received him warmly he told me he’d seen odysseus lodged with king idomeneus down in crete— reﬁtting his ships hardhit by the gales but he’d be home he said by summer or harvesttime his hulls freighted with treasure manned by ﬁghting crews so you old misery seeing a god has led you here to me don’t try to charm me now don’t spellbind me with lies never for that will i respect you treat you kindly no it’s my fear of zeus the god of guests and because i pity you …” “good god” the crafty man pressed on “what a dark suspicious heart you have inside you not even my oath can win you over make you see the light come strike a bargain—all the gods of olympus witness now our pact if your master returns here to your house dress me in shirt and cloak and send me off to dulichion at once the place i long to be but if your master doesn’t return as i predict set your men on me—ﬂing me off some rocky crag so the next beggar here may just think twice before he peddles lies” “surely friend”— the swineherd shook his head—”and just think of the praise and fame i’d win among mankind now and for all time to come if ﬁrst i took you under my roof i treated you kindly as my guest then cut you down and robbed you of your life— how keen i’d be to say my prayers to zeus but it’s high time for a meal i hope the men will come home any moment so we can ﬁx a tasty supper in the lodge” as host and guest conﬁded back and forth the herdsmen came in driving their hogs up close penning sows in their proper sties for the night squealing for all they’re worth shut inside their yard and the good swineherd shouted to his men “bring in your fattest hog i’ll slaughter it for our guest from far abroad we’ll savor it ourselves all too long we’ve sweated over these whitetusked bo ars—our wretched labor— while others wolf our work down free of charge” calling out as he split up kindling now with a good sharp ax and his men hauled in a tusker ﬁve years old rippling fat and stood him steady by the hearth the swineherd soul of virtue did not forget the gods he began the rite by plucking tufts from the porker’s head threw them into the ﬁre and prayed to all the powers “bring him home our wise odysseus home at last” then raising himself fulllength with an oak log he’d left unsplit he clubbed and stunned the beast and it gasped out its life … the men slashed its throat singed the carcass quickly quartered it all and then the swineherd cutting ﬁrst strips for the gods from every limb spread them across the thighs wrapped in sleek fat and sprinkling barley over them ﬂung them on the ﬁre they sliced the rest into pieces pierced them with skewers broiled them all to a turn and pulling them off the spits piled the platters high the swineherd standing up to share the meat—his sense of fairness perfect— carved it all out into seven equal portions one he set aside lifting up a prayer to the forest nymphs and hermes maia’s son and the rest he handed on to each man in turn but to odysseus he presented the boar’s long loin and the cut of honor cheered his master’s heart the man for all occasions thanked his host “i pray eumaeus you’ll be as dear to father zeus as you are to me—a man in my condition— you honor me by giving me your best” yo u r e p l i e d i n k i n d e u m a e u s s w i n e h e r d “eat my strange new friend … enjoy it now it’s all we have to offer as for father zeus one thing he will give and another he’ll hold back whatever his pleasure all things are in his power” he burned choice parts for the gods who never die and pouring glistening wine in a full libation placed the cup in his guest’s hands—odysseus raider of cities—and down he sat to his own share mesaulius served them bread a man the swineherd purchased for himself in his master’s absence— alone apart from his queen or old laertes— bought him from taphians bartered his own goods they reached out for the spread that lay at hand and when they’d put aside desire for food and drink mesaulius cleared the things away and now content with bread and meat they made for bed at once a foul night came on—the dark of the moon—and zeus rained from dusk to dawn and a sodden west wind raged odysseus spoke up now keen to test the swineherd would he take his cloak off hand it to his guest or at least tell one of his men to do the same he cared for the stranger so who ventured now “listen eumaeus and all you comrades here allow me to sing my praises for a moment say it’s the wine that leads me on the wild wine that sets the wisest man to sing at the top of his lungs laugh like a fool—it drives the man to dancing … it even tempts him to blurt out stories better never told but now that i’m sounding off i can’t hold back oh make me young again and the strength inside me steady as a rock just as i was that day we sprang a sudden ambush against the trojans odysseus led the raid with atreus’ son menelaus i was third in command—they’d chosen me themselves once we’d edged up under the city’s steep ramparts crowding the walls but sinking into the thick brake the reeds and marshy ﬂats huddling under our armor there we lay and a foul night came on the north wind struck freezing cold and down from the skies the snow fell like frost packed hard—the rims of our sh ields armored round with ice there all the rest of the men wore shirts and cloaks and hunching shields over their shoulders slept at ease not i i’d left my cloak at camp when i set out— idiot—never thinking it might turn cold so i joined in with just the shield on my back and a shining waistguard … but then at last the night’s third watch the stars just wheeling down— i muttered into his ear odysseus right beside me nudging him with an elbow—he perked up at once— ‘royal son of laertes odysseus full of tactics i’m not long for the living the cold will do me in see i’ve got no cloak some spirit’s fooled me— i came out halfdressed now there’s no escape’ i hadn’t ﬁnished—a thought ﬂashed in his mind no one could touch the man at plots or battles ‘shhh’ he hissed back—odysseus had a plan— ‘one of our ﬁghters over there might hear you’ then he propped his head on his forearm calling out ‘friends wake up i slept an d a god sent down a dream it warned that we’re too far from the ships exposed go someone tell agamemnon our ﬁeld marshal— he might rush reinforcements from the beach’ thoas son of andraemon sprang up at once ﬂung off his purple cloak and ran to the ships while i bundling into his wrap was glad at heart till dawn rose on her golden throne once more oh make me young again and the strength inside me steady as a rock one of the swineherds here would lend a wrap for love of a good soldier respect as well now they spurn me dressed in ﬁlthy rags” and you replied eumaeus loyal swineherd “now that was a ﬁne yarn you told oldtimer not without point not without proﬁt either yo u w o n’ t w a n t f o r c l o t h e s o r w h a t e v e r e l s e is due a wornout traveler come for help— not for tonight at least tomorrow morning you’ll have to ﬂap around in rags again here we’ve got no store of shirts and cloaks no changes just one wrap per man that’s all but just you wait till odysseus’ dear son comes back— that boy will deck you out in a cloak and shirt and send you off wherever your heart desires” with that he rose to his feet laid out a bed by the ﬁre throwing over it skins of sheep and goats and down odysseus lay eumaeus ﬂung on his guest the heavy ﬂaring cloak he kept in reserve to wear when winter brought some wild storm so here odysseus slept and the young hands slept beside him not the swineherd not his style to bed indoors apart from his pigs he geared up to go outside and it warmed odysseus’ heart eumaeus cared so much for his absent master’s goods first over his broad shoulders he slung a whetted sword wrapped himself in a cloak stit ched tight to block the wind and adding a cape the pelt of a shaggy wellfed goat he took a good sharp lance to ﬁght off men and dogs then out he went to sleep where his whitetusked boars had settled down for the night … just under a jutting crag that broke the north wind’s blast book xv the prince sets sail for home now south through the spacious dancingrings of lacedaemon athena went to remind the hero’s princely son of his journey home and spur him on his way she found him there with nestor’s gallant son bedded down in the porch of illustrious menelaus— pisistratus at least overcome with deep sound sleep but not telemachus welcome sleep could not hold him all through the godsent night he lay awake … tossing with anxious thoughts about his father hovering over him eyes ablaze athena said “it’s wrong telemachus wrong to rove so far so long from home leaving your own holdings unprotected—crowds in your palace so brazen they’ll carve up all your wealth devour it all and then your journey here will come to nothing quickly press menelaus lord of the warcry to speed you home at once if you want to ﬁnd your irreproachable mother still inside your house even now her father and brothers urge penelope to marry eurymachus who excels all other suitors at giving gifts and drives the brideprice higher she must not carry anything off against your will yo u k n o w h o w t h e h e a r t o f a w o m a n a l w a y s w o r k s she likes to build the wealth of her new groom— of the sons she bore of her dear departed husband not a memory of the dead no questions asked so sail for home i say with your own hands turn over all your goods to the one servingwoman you can trust the most till the gods bring to light your own noble bride and another thing take it to heart i tell you picked men of the suitors lie in ambush grimset in the straits between ithaca and rocky same poised to kill you before you can reach home but i have my doubts they will sooner the earth will swallow down a few of those young gallants who eat you out of house and home these days just give the channel islands a wide berth push on in your trim ship sail night and day and the deathless god who guards and pulls you through will send you a fresh fair wind from hard astern at your ﬁrst landfall ithaca’s outer banks speed ship and shipmates round to the city side but you—you make your way to the swineherd ﬁrst in charge of your pigs and true to you as always sleep the night there send him to town at once to tell the news to your mother wise penelope— you’ve made it back from pylos safe and sound” mission accomplished back she went to olympus’ heights as telemachus woke nestor’s son from his sweet sleep he dug a heel in his ribs and roused him briskly “up pisistratus hitch the team to the chariot— let’s head for home at once” “no telemachus” nestor’s son objected “much as we long to go we cannot drive a team in the dead of night morning will soon be here so wait i say wait till he loads our chariot down with gifts— the hero atrides menelaus the great spearman— and gives us warm salutes and sees us off like princes that’s the man a guest will remember all his days the lavish host who showers him with kindness” at those words dawn rose on her golden throne and menelaus lord of the warcry rising up from bed by the side of helen with her loose and lovely hair walked toward his guests as soon as he saw him telemachus rushed to pull a shimmering tunic on over his broad shoulders threw his ﬂaring cape and the young prince son of king odysseus strode out to meet his host “menelaus royal son of atreus captain of armies let me go back to my own country now the heart inside me longs for home at last” the lord of the warcry reassured the prince “i’d never detain you here too long telemachus not if your heart is set on going home i’d ﬁnd fault with another host i’m sure too warm to his guests too pressing or too cold balance is best in all things it’s bad either way spurring the stranger home who wants to linger holding the one who longs to leave—you know ‘welcome the coming speed the parting guest’ but wait till i load your chariot down with gifts— ﬁne ones too you’ll see with your own eyes— and tell the maids to serve a meal at hall we have god’s plenty here it’s honor and glory to us a help to you as well if you dine in style ﬁrst then leave to see the world and if you’re keen for the grand tour of all hellas right to the depths of argos i’ll escort you myself harness the horses guide you through the towns and no host will turn us away with empty hands each will give us at least one gift to prize— a handsome tripod cauldron forged in bronze a brace of mules or a solid golden cup” firmly resolved telemachus replied “menelaus royal atrides captain of armies i must go back to my own home at once when i started out i left no one behind to guard my own possessions god forbid searching for my great father i lose my life or lose some priceless treasure from my house” as soon as the lord of the warcry heard that he told his wife and servingwomen to lay out a meal in the hall at once they’d stores aplenty there eteoneus son of boethous came to join them— fresh from bed he lived close by the palace the warlord menelaus told him to build a ﬁre and broil some meat he quickly did his bidding down atrides walked to a storeroom ﬁlled with scent and not alone helen and megapenthes went along reaching the spot where all the heirlooms lay menelaus chose a generous twohandled cup he told his son megapenthes to take a mixingbowl solid silver while helen lingered beside the chests and there they were brocaded beautiful robes her own hands had woven queenly helen radiance of women lifted one from the lot the largest loveliest robe and richly worked and like a star it glistened deep beneath the others then all three went up and on through the halls until they found telemachus the redhaired king spoke out “oh my boy may zeus the thunderer hera’s lord grant you the journey home your heart desires of all the treasures lying heaped in my palace you shall have the ﬁnest most esteemed look i’ll give you this mixingbowl forged to perfection— it’s solid silver ﬁnished off with a lip of gold hephaestus made it himself and a royal friend phaedimus king of sidon lavished it on me when his palace welcomed me on passage home how pleased i’d be if you took it as a gift” and the warlord placed the twoeared cup in his hands while stalwart megapenthes carried in the glittering silver bowl and set it down before him helen her cheeks ﬂushed with beauty moved beside him holding the robe in her arms and offered warmly “here dear boy i too have a gift to give you a keepsake of helen—i wove it with my hands— for your own bride to wear when the blissful day of marriage dawns … until then let it rest in your mother’s room and may you return in joy—my parting wish— to your own grand house your native land at last” with that she laid the robe in his arms and he received it gladly prince pisistratus taking the gifts stowed them deep in the chariot cradle viewed them all with wonder the redhaired warlord led them back to his house and the guests took seats on low and highbacked chairs a maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so they might rinse their hands then pulled a gleaming table to their side a staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them appetizers aplenty too lavish with her bounty ready eteoneus carved and passed the meat the son of illustrious menelaus poured their wine they reached out for the good things that lay at hand and once they’d put aside desire for food and drink prince telemachus and the gallant son of nestor yoked their team mounted the blazoned car and drove through the gates and echoing colonnade the redhaired king menelaus followed both boys out his right hand holding a golden cup of honeyed wine so the two might pour libations forth at parting just in front of the straining team he strode lifting his cup and pledging both his guests “farewell my princes give my warm greetings to nestor the great commander always kind to me as a father long ago when we young men of achaea fought at troy” and tactful telemachus replied at once “surely my royal host we’ll tell him all as soon as we reach old nestor—all you say i wish i were just as sure i’d ﬁnd odysseus waiting there at home when i reach ithaca i’d tell him i come from you treated with so much kindness at your hands loaded down with all these priceless gifts” at his last words a bird ﬂew past on the right an eagle clutching a huge white goose in its talons plucked from the household yards and all rushed after shouting men and women and swooping toward the chariot now the bird veered off to the right again before the horses all looked up overjoyed—people’s spirits lifted nestor’s son pisistratus spoke out ﬁrst “look there king menelaus captain of armies what did the god send down that sign for you or the two of us” the warlord fell to thinking— how to read the omen rightly how to reply … but longrobed helen stepped in well before him “listen to me and i will be your prophet sure as the gods have ﬂashed it in my mind and it will come to pass i know it will just as the eagle swooped down from the crags where it was born and bred just as it snatched that goose fattened up for the kill inside the house so after many trials and roving long and hard odysseus will descend on his house and take revenge— unless he’s home already sowing seeds of ruin for that whole crowd of suitors” “oh if only” pensive telemachus burst out in thanks to helen “zeus the thundering lord of hera makes it so— even at home i’ll pray to you as a deathless goddess” he cracked the lash and the horses broke quickly careering through the city out into open country shaking the yoke across their shoulders all day long the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark as they reached phera pulling up to diodes’ halls the son of ortilochus son of the alpheus river he gave them a royal welcome there they slept the night when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more they yoked their pair again mounted the blazoned car and out through the gates and echoing colonnade they whipped the team to a run and on they ﬂew holding nothing back approaching pylos soon the craggy citadel that was when telemachus turned to pisistratus saying “son of nestor won’t you do as i ask you see it through we’re friends for all our days now so we claim thanks to our fathers’ friendship we’re the same age as well and this tour of ours has made us more like brothers prince don’t drive me past my vessel drop me there yo u r f a t h e r ’s o l d i n l o v e w i t h h i s h o s p i t a l i t y i fear he’ll hold me chaﬁng in his palace— i must hurry home” the son of nestor pondered … how to do it properly see it through pausing a moment then this way seemed best swerving his team he drove down to the ship tied up on shore and loaded into her stern the splendid gifts the robes and gold menelaus gave and sped his friend with a ﬂight of winging words “climb aboard now—fast muster all your men before i get home and break the news to father with that man’s overbearing spirit—i know it know it all too well—he’ll never let you go he’ll come down here and summon you himself he won’t return without you believe me in any case he’ll ﬂy into a rage” with that warning he whipped his sleek horses back to pylos city and reached his house in no time telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates “stow our gear my comrades deep in the holds and board at once—we must be on our way” his shipmates snapped to orders swung aboard and sat to the oars in ranks but just as telemachus prepared to launch praying sacriﬁcing to pallas by the stern a man from a faroff country came toward him now a fugitive out of argos he had killed a man … he was a prophet sprung of melampus’ line of seers melampus who lived in pylos mother of ﬂocks some years ago rich among his pylians at home in his great high house until he was made to go abroad to foreign parts ﬂeeing his native land and hotblooded neleus— most imperious man alive—who’d commandeered his vast estate and held it down by force for one entire year that year melampus bound by cruel chains in the halls of phylacus suffered agonies—all for neleus’ daughter pero that and the mad spell a fury murderous spirit cast upon his mind but the seer worked free of death and drove the lusty bellowing cattle out of phylace back to pylos there he avenged himself on neleus for the shameful thing the king had done to him and escorted pero home as his brother’s bride but he himself went off to a distant country argos land of stallions—his destined home where he would live and rule the argive nation here he married a wife and built a highroofed house and sired antiphates and mantius two staunch sons antiphates fathered oicles gallant heart oicles fathered amphiaraus driver of armies whom storming zeus and apollo loved intensely showering him with every form of kindness but he never reached the threshold of old age he died at thebes—undone by a bribe his wife accepted— leaving behind his two sons alcmaeon and amphilochus on his side mantius sired polyphides and clitus both but dawn of the golden throne whisked clitus away overwhelmed by his beauty so the boy would live among the deathless gods ye t a p o l l o m a d e m a g n a n i m o u s p o l y p h i d e s a p r o p h e t — after amphiaraus’ death—the greatest seer on earth but a feud with his father drove him off to hyperesia where he made his home and prophesied to the world … this prophet’s son it was—theoclymenus his name— who approached telemachus now and found him pouring wine to a god and saying prayers beside his ship “friend” he said in a winging supplication “since i ﬁnd you burning offerings here i beg you by these rites and the god you pray to then by your own life and the lives of all the men who travel with you—tell me truly don’t hold back who are you where are you from your city your parents” “of course stranger” the forthright prince responded “i will tell you everything clearly as i can ithaca is my country odysseus is my father— there was a man or was he all a dream … but he’s surely died a wretched death by now ye t h e r e i ’ v e c o m e w i t h m y c r e w a n d b l a c k s h i p out for news of my father lost and gone so long” and the godlike seer theoclymenus replied “just like you i too have left my land— i because i killed a man of my own tribe but he has many brothers and kin in argos stallionland who rule the plains in force fleeing death at their hands a dismal fate i am a fugitive now doomed to wander across this mortal world so take me aboard hear a fugitive’s prayer don’t let them kill me—they’re after me well i know” “so desperate” thoughtful telemachus exclaimed “how could i drive you from my ship come sail with us we’ll tend you at home with all we can provide” and he took the prophet’s honed bronze spear laid it down fulllength on the rolling deck swung aboard the deepsea craft himself assuming the pilot’s seat reserved astern and put the seer beside him cables cast off telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates “a l l l a y h a n d s t o t a c k l e ” t h e y s p r a n g t o o r d e r s hoisting the pinewood mast they stepped it ﬁrm in its block amidships lashed it fast with stays and with braided rawhide halyar ds hauled the white sail high now brighteyed athena sent them a stiff following wind blustering out of a clear sky gusting on so the ship might run its course through the salt sea at top speed— and past the springs she raced an d the chalcis’ rushing stream as the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark and on she pressed for pheae driven on by a wind from zeus and ﬂew past lovely elis wh ere epeans rule in power and then telemachus veered for the jagged islands wondering all the way— would he sweep clear of death or be cut down the king and loyal swineherd just that night were supping with other ﬂeldhands in the lodge once they’d put aside desire for food and drink odysseus spoke up eager to test the swineherd see if he’d stretch out his warm welcome now invite him to stay on in the farmstead here or send him off to town “listen eumaeus all you comrades here—at the crack of dawn i mean to go to town and do my begging not be a drain on you and all your men but advise me well give me a trusty guide to see me there and then i’m on my own to roam the streets—i must i have no choice— hoping to ﬁnd a handout just a crust or cupful i’d really like to go to the house of king odysseus and give my news to his cautious queen penelope why i’d even mix with th ose overweening suitors— would they spare me a plateful look at all they have i’d do good work for them promptly anything they want let me tell you listen closely catch my drift … thanks to hermes the guide who gives all work of our hands the grace and fame that it deserves no one alive can match me at household chores building a good ﬁre splitting kindling neatly carving roasting meat and pouring rounds of wine … anything menials do to serve their noble masters” “god’s sake my friend” you broke in now eumaeus loyal swineherd deeply troubled “what’s got into your head what crazy plan yo u m u s t b e h e l l b e n t o n d e s t r u c t i o n o n t h e s p o t if you’re keen to mingle with that mob of suitors— their pride and violence hit the iron skies they’re a far cry from you the men who do their bidding y oung bucks all rigged out in their ﬁne robes and shirts hair sleeked down with oil faces always beaming the ones who slave for them the tables polished sagging under the bread and meat and wine no stay here no one ﬁnds you a burden surely not i not any comrade here yo u w a i t t i l l o d y s s e u s ’ d e a r s o n c o m e s b a c k — that boy will deck you out in a cloak and shirt and send you off wherever your heart desires” “if only eumaeus” the wayworn exile said “you were as dear to father zeus as you are to me yo u w h o s t o p p e d m y p a i n m y e n d l e s s h o m e s i c k r o v i n g tramping about the world—there’s nothing worse for a man but the fact is that men put up with misery to stuff their cursed bellies but seeing you hold me here urging me now to wait for him the prince who’s on his way tell me about the mother of king odysseus please the father he left as well—on the threshold of old age— when he sailed off to war are they still alive perhaps still looking into the light of day or dead by now and down in death’s long house” “friend” the swineherd foreman of men assured his guest “i’ll tell you the whole story point by point laertes is still alive but night and day he prays to zeus waiting there in his house for the life breath to slip away and leave his body his heart’s so racked for his son lost and gone these years for his wife so ﬁne so wise— her death is the worst blow he’s had to suffer—it made him old before his time she died of grief for her boy her glorious boy it wore her down a wretched way to go i pray that no one i lo ve dies such a death no island neighbor of mi ne who treats me kindly while she was still alive heartsick as she was it always moved me to ask about her learn the news she’d reared me herself and right beside her daughter ctimene graceful girl with her long light gown the youngest one she’d borne … just the two of us growing up together the woman tending me almost like her child till we both reached the lovely ﬂush of youth and then her parents gave her away in marriage yes to a samian man and a haul of gifts they got but her mother decked me out in cloak and shirt good clothing she wrapped about me—gave me sandals sent me here this farm she loved me from the heart oh how i miss her kindness now the happy gods speed the work that i labor at that gives me food and drink to spare for the ones i value but from queen penelope i never get a thing never a winning word no friendly gesture not since this this pl ague has hit the house— these high and mighty suitors servants miss it terribly gossiping back and forth with the mistress gathering scraps of news a snack and a cup or two then taking home to the ﬁelds some little gift it never fails to cheer a servant’s heart” “imagine that” his canny master said “you must have been just a little fellow eumaeus when you were swept so far from home and parents come tell me the whole story truly too was your city sacked— some city ﬁlled with people and wide streets where your father and your mother made their home or were you all alone herding your sheep and cattle when pirates kidnapped shipped and sold you off to this man’s house who paid a healthy price” “my friend” the swineherd answered foreman of men “you really want my story so many questions—well listen in quiet then and take your ease sit back and drink your wine the nights are endless now we’ve plenty of time to sleep or savor a long tale no need you know to turn in before the hour even too much sleep can be a bore but anyone else who feels the urge can go to bed and then at the crack of dawn break bread turn out and tend our master’s pigs we two will keep to the shelter here eat and drink and take some joy in each other’s heartbreaking sorrows sharing each other’s memories over the years you know a man ﬁnds solace even in old sorrows true a man who’s weathered many blows and wandered many miles my own story this will answer all your questions … there’s an island syrie—you may have heard of it— off above ortygia wher e the sun wheels around not so packed with people still a good place though ﬁne for sheep and cattle rich in wine and wheat hunger never attacks the land no sickness either that always stalks the lives of us poor men no as each generation grows old on the island down apollo comes with his silver bow with artemis and they shoot them all to death with gentle arrows two cities there are that split the land in half and over them both my father ruled in force— ormenus’ son ctesius a man like a deathless god one day a band of phoenicians landed there the famous seadogs sharp bargainers too the holds of their black ship brimful with a hoard of ﬂashy baubles now my father kept a phoenici an woman in his house beautiful tall and skilled at weaving lovely things and her rascal countrymen lusted to seduce her yes and lost no time—she was washing clothes when one of them waylaid her beside their ship in a long deep embrace that can break a woman’s will even the best alive and then he asked her questions … her name who was she where did she come from she waved at once to my father’s highroofed house— ‘but i’m proud to hail from sidon paved in bronze’ she said ‘and arybas was my father a man who rolled in wealth i was heading home from the ﬁelds when taphian pirates snatched me away and they shipped and sold me here to this man’s house he paid a good stiff price’ the sailor her secret lover lured her on ‘well then why don’t you sail back home with us— see your own high house your father and mother there they’re still alive and people say they’re rich’ ‘now there’s a tempting offer’ she said in haste ‘if only you sailors here would swear an oath you’ll land me safe at home without a scratch’ those were her terms and once they vowed to keep them swore their oaths they’d never do her harm the woman hatched a plan ‘now mum’s the word let none of your shipmates say a thing to me meeting me on the street or at the springs someone might go running off to the house and tell the old king—he’d think the worst clap me in cruel chains and ﬁnd a way to kill you so keep it a secret down deep get on with buying your home cargo quickly but once your holds are loaded up with goods then fast as you can you send the word to me over there at the palace i’ll bring you all the gold i can lay my hands on and something else i’ll give you in the bargain fare for passage home … i’m nurse to my master’s son in the palace now— such a precious toddler scampering round outside always at my heels i’ll bring him aboard as well wherever you sell him off whatever foreign parts he’ll fetch you quite a price’ bargain struck back the woman went to our lofty halls and the rovers stayed on with us one whole year bartering piling up big hoards in their hollow ship and once their holds were loaded full for sailing they sent a messenger fast to alert the woman this crafty bandit came to my father’s house dangling a golden choker linked with amber beads and while the maids at hall and my noble mother kept on fondling it—dazzled feasting their eyes and making bids—he gave a quiet nod to my nurse he gave her the nod and slunk back to his ship grabbing my hand she swept me through the house and there in the porch she came on cups and tables left by the latest feasters father’s men of council just gone off to the meeting grounds for full debate— and quick as a ﬂash she snatched up three goblets tucked them into her bosom whisked them off and i tagged along lost in all my innocence the sun sank the roads of the world grew dark and both on the run we reached the bay at once where the swift phoenician ship lay set to sail handing us up on board the crewmen launched out on the foaming lanes and zeus sent wind astern six whole days we sailed six nights nonstop and then when the god brought on the seventh day artemis showering arrows came and shot the woman— headﬁrst into the bilge she splashed like a diving tern and the crewmen heaved her body over a nice treat for the seals and ﬁsh but left me all alone cowering sick at heart … until at last the wind and current bore us on to ithaca here where laertes bought me with his wealth and so i ﬁrst laid eyes on this good land” and royal king odysseus answered warmly “eumaeus so much misery y ou’ve moved my heart deeply with your long tale—such pain such sorrow true but look at the good fortune zeus sends you handinhand with the bad after all your toil you reached the house of a decent kindly man who gives you all you need in meat and drink— he’s seen to that i’d say— it’s a ﬁne life you lead better than mine … i’ve been drifting through cities up and down the earth and now i’ve landed here” so guest and host conﬁded through the night until they slept a little at least not long dawn soon rose and took her golden throne that hour telemachus and his shipmates raised the coasts of home they struck sail and lowered the mast smartly rowed her into a mooring under oars out went the bowstones cables fast astern the crew themselves swung out in the breaking surf they got a meal together and mixed some ruddy wine and once they’d put aside desire for food and drink clearheaded telemachus gave the men commands “pull our black ship round to the city now— i’m off to my herdsmen and my farms by nightfall once i’ve seen to my holdings i’ll be down in town in the morning i’ll give you wages for the voyage a handsome feast of meat and hearty wine” the seer theoclymenus broke in quickly “where shall i go dear boy of all the lords in rocky ithaca whose house shall i head for now or do i go straight to your mother’s house and yours” “surely in better times” discreet telemachus replied “i would invite you home our hospitality never fails but now i fear it could only serve you poorly i’ll be away and mother would never see you she rarely appears these days what with those suitors milling in the hall she keeps to her upper story weaving at her loom but i’ll mention someone else you might just visit eurymachus wise polybus’ ﬁne upstanding son he’s the man of the hour our island people look on him like a god—the prince of suitors hottest to wed my mother seize my father’s powers but god knows—zeus up ther e in his bright olympus— whether or not before that wedding day arrives he’ll bring the day of death on all their heads” at his last words a bird ﬂew past on the right a hawk apollo’s windswift herald—tight in his claws a struggling dove and he ripped its feathers out and they drifted down to earth between the ship and the young prince himself … the prophet called him aside clear of his men and grasped his hand exclaiming “look telemachus the will of god just winged that bird on your right why the moment i saw it here before my eyes i knew it was a sign no line more kingly than yours in all of ithaca— yours will reign forever” “if only friend” alert telemachus answered “all you say comes true yo u ’ d s o o n k n o w m y a f f e c t i o n k n o w m y g i f t s any man you meet would call you blest” he turned to a trusted friend and said “piraeus son of clytius you are the one who’s done my bidding more than all other friends who sailed with me to pylos please take this guest of mine to your own house treat him kindly host him with all good will till i can come myself” “of course telemachus” piraeus the gallant spearman offered warmly “stay upcountry just as long as you like i’ll tend the man he’ll never lack a lodging” piraeus boarded ship and told the crew to embark at once and cast off cables quickly— they swung aboard and sat to the oars in ranks telemachus fastened rawhide sandals on his feet and took from the decks his rugged bronzetipped spear the men cast off pushed out and pulled for town as telemachus ordered king odysseus’ son the prince strode out briskly legs speeding him on till he reached the farm where his great droves of pigs crowded their pens and the loyal swineherd often slept beside them always the man to serve his masters well book xvi father and son as dawn came into the lodge the king and loyal swineherd set out breakfast once they had raked the ﬁre up and got the herdsmen off with droves of pigs and now telemachus … the howling dogs went nuzzling up around him not a growl as he approached from inside odysseus noticed the pack’s quiet welcome noticed the light tread of footsteps too and turned to eumaeus quickly winged a word “eumaeus here comes a friend of yours i’d say someone you know at least the pack’s not barking must be fawning around him i can hear his footfall” the words were still on his lips when his own son stood in the doorway there the swineherd started up amazed he dropped the bowls with a clatter—he’d been busy mixing ruddy wine straight to the prince he rushed and kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes both hands as the tears rolled down his cheeks as a father brimming wi th love welcomes home his darling only son in a warm embrace— what pain he’s borne for him and him alone— home now in the tenth year from far abroad so the loyal swineherd hugged the beaming prince he clung for dear life covering him with kisses yes like one escaped from death eumaeus wept and sobbed his words ﬂew from the heart “y ou’re home telemachus sweet light of my eyes i neve r thought i’d see you again once you’d shipped to pylos quick dear boy come in let me look at you look to my heart’s content— under my own roof the rover home at last yo u r a r e l y v i s i t t h e f a r m a n d m e n t h e s e d a y s always keeping to town as if it cheered you to see them there that infernal crowd of suitors” “have it your way” thoughtful telemachus replied “dear old man it’s all for you that i’ve come to see you for myself and learn the news— whether mother still holds out in the halls or some other man has married her at last and odysseus’ bed i suppose is lying empty blanketed now with ﬁlthy cobwebs” “surely” the foreman of men responded “she’s still waiting there in your halls poor woman suffering so her life an endless hardship … wasting away the nights weeping away the days” with that he took the bronze spear from the boy and telemachus crossing the stone doorsill went inside the lodge as he approached his father odysseus rose to yield his seat but the son on his part waved him back “stay where you are stranger i know we can ﬁnd another seat somewhere here on our farm and here’s the man to fetch it” so odysseus moving back sat down once more and now for the prince the swineherd strewed a bundle of fresh green brushwood topped it off with sheepskin and there the true son of odysseus took his place eumaeus set before them platters of roast meat left from the meal he’d had the day before he promptly served them bread heaped in baskets mixed their hearty wine in a wooden bowl and then sat down himself to face the king they reached for the good things that lay at hand and when they’d put aside desire for food and drink telemachus asked his loyal servingman at last “old friend where does this stranger come from why did the sailors land him here in ithaca who did they say they are i hardly think he came this way on foot” yo u a n s w e r e d h i m e u m a e u s l o y a l s w i n e h e r d “here my boy i’ll tell you the whole true story he hails from crete’s broad land he’s proud to say but he claims he’s drifted round through countless towns of men roaming the earth … so a god’s spun out his fate he just now broke away from some thesprotian ship and came to my farm i’ll put him in your hands you tend to him as you like he counts on you he says for care and shelter” “shelter oh eumaeus” telemachus replied “that word of yours it cuts me to the quick how can i lend the stranger refuge in my house i’m young myself i can hardly trust my hands to ﬁght off any man who rises up against me then my mother’s wavering always torn two ways whether to stay with me and care for the household true to her husband’s bed the people’s voice as well or leave at long last with the best man in achaea who courts her in the halls who offers her the most but our new guest since he’s arrived at your house i’ll give him a shirt and cloak to wear good clothing give him a twoedged sword and sandals for his feet and send him off wherever his heart desires or if you’d rather keep him here at the farmstead tend to him here and i’ll send up the clothes and full rations to keep the man in food he’ll be no drain on you and all your men but i can’t let him go down and join the suitors they’re far too abusive reckless know no limits they’ll make a mockery of him—that would break my heart it’s hard for a man to win his way against a mob even a man of iron they are much too strong” “friend”—the longenduring odysseus stepped in— “surely it’s right for me to say a word at this point my heart by god is torn to pieces hearing this both of you telling how these reckless suitors there in your own house against your will plot your ruin—a ﬁne young prince like you tell me though do you let yourself be so abused or do people round about stirred up by the prompting of some god despise you or are your brothers at fault brothers a man can trust to ﬁght beside him true no matter what deadly bloodfeud rages on would i were young as you to match my spirit now or i were the son of great odysseus or the king himself returned from all his roving—there’s still room for hope then let some foreigner lop my head off if i failed to march right into odysseus’ royal halls and kill them all and what if i went down crushed by their numbers—i ﬁghting alone i’d rather die cut down in my own house than have to look on at their outrage day by day guests treated to blows men dragging the servingwomen through the noble house exploiting them all no shame and the gushing wine swilled the food squandered— gorging for gorging’s sake— and the courting game goes on no end in sight” “y ou’re right my friend” sober telemachus agreed “now let me tell you the whole story ﬁrst to last it’s not that all our people have turned against me keen for a showdown nor have i any brothers at fault brothers a man can trust to ﬁght beside him true no matter what deadly bloodfeud rages on … zeus made our line a line of only sons arcesius had only one son laertes and laertes had only one son odysseus and i am odysseus’ only son he fathered me he left me behind at home and from me he got no joy so now our house is plagued by swarms of enemies all the nobles who rule the islands round about dulichion and same and wooded zacynthus too and all who lord it in rocky ithaca as well— down to the last man they court my mother they lay waste my house and mother … she neither rejects a marriage she despises nor can she bear to bring the courting to an end— while they continue to bleed my household white soon—you wait—they’ll grind me down as well but all lies in the lap of the great gods eumaeus good old friend go quickly to wise penelope tell her i’m home from pylos safe and sound i’ll stay on right here but you come back as soon as you’ve told the news to her alone no other achaean must hear— all too many plot to take my life” “i know” you assured your prince eumaeus loyal swineherd “i see your point—there’s sense in this old head one thing more and make your orders clear on the same trip do i go and give the news to king laertes too for many years poor man heartsick for his son he’d always keep an eye on the farm and take his meals with the hired hands whenever he felt the urge to now from the day you sailed away to pylos not a sip or a bite he’s touched they say not as he did before and his eyes are shut to all the farmyard labors huddled over groaning in grief and tears he wastes away—the man’s all skin and bones” “so much the worse” telemachus answered ﬁrmly “leave him alone though it hurts us now we must if men could have all they want free for the taking i’d take ﬁrst my father’s journey home so you go and give the message then come back no roaming over the ﬁelds to ﬁnd laertes tell my mother to send her housekeeper fast as she can in secret— she can give the poor old man the news” that roused eumaeus the swineherd grasped his sandals strapped them onto his feet and made for town his exit did not escape athena’s notice … approaching closer now she appeared a woman beautiful tall and skilled at weaving lovely things just at the shelter’s door she stopped visible to odysseus but telemachus could not see her sense her there— the gods don’t show themselves to every man alive odysseus saw her so did the dogs no barking now they whimpered cringing away in terror through the yard she gave a sign with her brows odysseus caught it out of the lodge he went and past the high stockade and stood before the goddess athena urged him on “royal son of laertes odysseus old campaigner now is the time now tell your son the truth hold nothing back so the two of you can plot the suitors’ doom and then set out for town i myself won’t lag behind you long— i’m blazing for a battle” athena stroked him with her golden wand first she made the cloak and shirt on his body fresh and clean then made him taller supple young his ruddy tan came back the cut of his jawline ﬁrmed and the dark beard clustered black around his chin her work complete she went her way once more and odysseus returned to the lodge his own son gazed at him wonderstruck terriﬁed too turning his eyes away suddenly— this must be some god— and he let ﬂy with a burst of exclamations “friend you’re a new man—not what i saw before yo u r c l o t h e s t h e y ’ v e c h a n g e d e v e n y o u r s k i n h a s c h a n g e d — surely you are some god who rules the vaulting skies oh be kind and we w ill give you offerings gifts of hammered gold to warm your heart— spare us please i beg you” “no i am not a god” the longenduring great odysseus returned “why confuse me with one who never dies no i am your father— the odysseus you wept for all your days you bore a world of pain the cruel abuse of men” and with those words odysseus kissed his son and the tears streamed down his cheeks and wet the ground though before he’d always reined his emotions back but still not convinced that it was his father telemachus broke out wild with disbelief “no you’re not odysseus not my father just some spirit spellbinding me now— to make me ache with sorrow all the more impossible for a mortal to work such marvels not with his own devices not unless some god comes down in person eage r to make that mortal young or old—like that why just now you were old and wrapped in rags but now look you seem like a god who rules the skies up there” “telemachus” odysseus man of exploits urged his son “it’s wrong to marvel carried away in wonder so at sight of your father here before your eyes no other odysseus will ever return to you that man and i are one the man you see … here after many hardships endless wanderings after twenty years i have come home to native ground at last my changing so athena’s work the fighter’s queen— she has that power she makes me look as she likes now like a beggar the next moment a young man decked out in handsome clothes about my body it’s light work for the gods who rule the skies to exalt a mortal man or bring him low” at that odysseus sat down again and telemachus threw his arms around his great father sobbing uncontrollably as the deep desire for tears welled up in both they cried out shrilling cries pulsing sharper than birds of prey—eagles vultures with hooked claws— when farmers plunder their nest of young too young to ﬂy both men so ﬁlled with compassion eyes streaming tears that now the sunlight would have set upon their cries if telemachus had not asked his father all at once “what sort of ship dear father brought you here— ithaca at last who did the sailors say they are i hardly think you came back home on foot” so long an exile great odysseus replied “surely my son i’ll tell you the whole story now phaeacians brought me here the famous sailors who ferry home all men who reach their shores they sailed me across the sea in their swift ship they set me down in ithaca sound asleep and gave me glittering gifts—bronze and hoards of gold and robes all lie stowed in a cave thanks to the gods’ help and athena’s inspiration spurred me here now so we could plan the slaughter of our foes come give me the full tally of these suitors— i must see their numbers gauge their strength then i’ll deploy this old tactician’s wits decide if the two of us can take them on alone without allies or we should hunt reserves to back us up” “father” clearheaded telemachus countered quickly “all my life i’ve heard of your great fame— a brave man in war and a deep mind in counsel— but what you say dumbfounds me staggers imagination how on earth could two men ﬁght so many and so strong these suitors are not just ten or twenty they’re far more— you count them up for yourself now take a moment … from dulichion ﬁftytwo of them picked young men six servants in their troop from same twentyfour from zacynthus twenty achaeans nobles all and the twelve best lords from ithaca itself medon the herald’s with them a gifted bard and two henchmen skilled to carve their meat if we pit ourselves against all these in the house i fear the revenge you come back home to take will recoil on our heads—a bitter deadly blow think can you come up with a friendinarms some man to ﬁght beside us some brave heart” “let me tell you” the old soldier said “bear it in mind now listen to me closely think will athena ﬂanked by father zeus do for the two of us or shall i rack my brains for another champion” telemachus answered shrewdly full of poise “two great champions those you name it’s true off in the clouds they sit and they lord it over gods and mortal men” “trust me” his seasoned father reassured him “they won’t hold off long from the cries and clash of battle not when we and the suitors put our ﬁghting strength to proof in my own halls but now with daybreak home you go and mix with that overbearing crowd the swineherd will lead me into the city later looking old and broken a beggar once again if they abuse me in the palace steel yourself no matter what outrage i must suffer even if they drag me through our house by the heels and throw me out or pelt me with things they hurl— you just look on endure it prompt them to quit their wild reckless ways try to win them over with friendly words those men will never listen now the day of doom is hovering at their heads one more thing take it to heart i urge you when athena queen of tactics tells me it is time i’ll give you a nod and when you catch that signal round up all the deadly weapons kept in the hall stow them away upstairs in a storeroom’s deep recess— all the arms and armor—and when the suitors miss them and ask you questions put them off with a winning story ‘i stowed them away clear of the smoke a far cry from the arms odysseus left when he went to troy ﬁredamaged equipment black with reeking fumes and a god reminded me of something darker too when you’re in your cups a quarrel might break out you’d wound each other shame your feasting here and cast a pall on your courting iron has powers to draw a man to ruin’ just you leave a pair of swords for the two of us a pair of spears and a pair of oxhide bucklers right at hand so we can break for the weapons seize them then athena zeus in his wisdom—they will daze the suitors’ wits now one last thing bear it in mind y ou must if you are my own true son born of my blood let no one hear that odysseus has come home don’t let laertes know not eumaeus either none in the household not penelope herself yo u a n d i a l o n e w i l l a s s e s s t h e w o m e n’s m o o d and we might test a few of the servingmen as well where are the ones who still respect us both who hold us in awe and who shirk their duties— slighting you because you are so young” “soon enough father” his gallant son replied “you’ll sense the courage inside me that i know— i’m hardly a ﬂighty weakwilled boy these days but i think your last plan would gain us nothing reconsider i urge you yo u ’ l l w a s t e t i m e r o a m i n g a r o u n d o u r h o l d i n g s probing the ﬁeldhands man by man while the suitors sit at ease in our house devouring all our goods— those brazen rascals never spare a scrap but i do advise you to sound the women out who are disloyal to you who are guiltless the men—i say no to testing them farm by farm that’s work for later if you have really seen a sign from zeus whose shield is storm and thunder” now as father and son conspired shaping plans the ship that brought the prince and shipmates back from pylos was just approaching ithaca home port as soon as they put in to the harbor’s deep bay they hauled the black vessel up onto dry land and eager deckhands bore away their gear and rushed the priceless gifts to clytius’ house but they sent a herald on to odysseus’ halls at once to give the news to thoughtful cautious penelope that telemachus was home—just upcountry now but he’d told his mates to sail across to port— so the noble queen would not be seized with fright and break down in tears and now those two men met herald and swineherd both out on the same errand to give the queen the news but once they reached the house of the royal king the herald strode up into the servingwomen’s midst and burst out “y our beloved son my queen is home at last” eumaeus though bending close to penelope whispered every word that her dear son entrusted him to say message told in full he left the halls and precincts heading for his pigs but the news shook the suitors dashed their spirits out of the halls they crowded past the highwalled court and there before the gates they sat in council polybus’ son eurymachus opened up among them “friends what a ﬁne piece of work he’s carried off telemachus—what insolence—and we thought his little jaunt would come to grief up now launch a black ship the best we can ﬁnd—muster a crew of oarsmen row the news to our friends in ambush fast bring them back at once” and just then— he’d not quite ﬁnished when amphinomus wheeling round in his seat saw their vessel moored in the deep harbor their comrades striking sail and hoisting oars he broke into heady laughter called his friends “no need for a message now they’re home look there some god gave them the news or they saw the prince’s ship go sailing past and failed to overtake her” rising all trooped down to the water’s edge as the crew hauled the vessel up onto dry land and the hotblooded hands bore off their gear then in a pack they went to the meeting grounds suffering no one else young or old to sit among them eupithes’ son antinous rose and harangued them all “what a blow see how the gods have saved this boy from bloody death and our lookouts all day long stationed atop the windy heights kept watch shift on shift and once the sun went down we’d never sleep the night ashore never always aboard our swift ship cruising till dawn patrolling to catch telemac hus kill him on the spot and all the while some spirit whisked him home so here at home we’ll plot his certain death he must never slip through our hands again that boy—while he still lives i swear we’ll never bring our venture off the clever little schemer he does have his skills and the crowds no longer show us favor not at all so act before he can gather his people in assembly he’ll never give in an inch i know he’ll rise and rage away shouting out to them all how we we schemed his sudden death but never caught him hearing of our foul play they ’ll hardly sing our praises why they might do us damage run us off our lands drive us abroad to hunt for strangers’ shores strike ﬁrst i say and kill him— clear of town in the ﬁelds or on the road then we’ll seize his estates and worldly goods carve them up between us share and share alike but as for his palace let his mother keep it she and the man she weds there’s my plan if you ﬁnd it offensive if you want him living on—in full command of his patrimony— gather here no more then living the life of kings consuming all his wealth each from his own house must try to win her showering her with gifts then she can marry the one who offers most the man marked out by fate to be her husband” that brought them all to a hushed stunned silence till amphinomus rose to have his say among them— the noted son of nisus king aretias’ grandson the chief who led the suitors from dulichion land of grass and grains and the man who pleased penelope the most thanks to his timely words and good clear sense concerned for their welfare now he stood and argued “friends i’ve no desire to kill telemachus not i— it’s a terrible thing to shed the blood of kings wait sound out the will of the gods—that ﬁrst if the decrees of mighty zeus commend the work i’ll kill the prince myself and spur on all the rest if the gods are against it then i say hold back” so amphinomus urged and won them over they rose at once returned to odysseus’ palace entered and took their seats on burnished chairs but now an inspiration took the discreet penelope to face her suitors brutal reckless men the queen had heard it all … how they plotted inside the house to kill her son the herald medon told her—he’d overheard their schemes and so ﬂanked by her ladies she descended to the hall that luster of women once she reached her suitors drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof and wheeling on antinous cried out against him “y ou antinous violent vicious scheming— you they say are the best man your age in ithaca best for eloquence counsel y ou’re nothing of the sort madman why do you weave destruction for telemachus— show no pity to those who need it—those over whom almighty zeus stands guard it’s wrong unholy yes weaving death for those who deserve your mercy don’t you know how your father ﬂed here once a fugitive terriﬁed of the people up in arms against him because he’d joined some taphian pirates out to attack thesprotians sworn allies of ours the mobs were set to destroy him rip his life out devour his vast wealth to their heart’s content but odysseus held them back he kept their fury down and this is the man whose house you waste scotfree whose wife you court whose son you mean to kill— you make my life an agony stop i tell you stop all this and make the rest stop too” but polybus’ son eurymachus tried to calm her “wise penelope daughter of icarius courage disabuse yourself of all these worries now that man is not alive— he never will be he never can be born— who’ll lift a hand against telemachus your son not while i walk the land and i can see the light i tell you this—so help me it will all come true— in an instant that man’s blood will spurt around my spear my spear since time and again odysseus dandled me on his knees the great raider of cities fed me roasted meat and held the red wine to my lips so to me your son is the dearest man alive and i urge the boy to have no fear of death not from the suitors at least what comes from the gods—there’s no escaping that” encouraging all the way but all the while plotting the prince’s murder in his mind … the queen going up to her lofty welllit room fell to weeping for odysseus her beloved husband till watchful athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep returning just at dusk to odysseus and his son the loyal swineherd found they’d killed a yearling pig and standing over it now were busy ﬁxing supper but athena had approached laertes’ son odysseus tapped him with her wand and made him old again she dressed him in ﬁlthy rags too for fear eumaeus recognizing his master facetoface might hurry back to shrewd penelope blurting out the news and never hide the secret in his heart telemachus was the ﬁrst to greet the swineherd “welcome home my friend what’s the talk in town are the swaggering suitors back from ambush yet— or still waiting to catch me coming home” yo u a n s w e r e d t h e p r i n c e e u m a e u s l o y a l s w i n e h e r d “i had no time to go roaming all through town digging round for that my heart raced me on to get my message told and rush back here but i met up with a fast runner there sent by your crew a herald ﬁrst to tell your mother all the news and this i know i saw with my own eyes— i was just above the city heading home clambering over hermes’ ridge when i caught sight of a trim ship pulling into the harbor loaded down with a crowd aboard her shields and twoedged spears i think they’re the men you’re after—i’m not sure” at that the young prince telemachus smiled glancing toward his father avoiding eumaeus’ eyes and now with the roasting done the meal set out they ate well and no one’s hunger lacked a proper share of supper when they’d put aside desire for food and drink they remembered bed and took the gift of sleep book xvii stranger at the gates when young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more telemachus strapped his rawhide sandals to his feet and the young prince the son of king odysseus picked up the rugged spear that ﬁt his grip and striking out for the city told his swineherd “i’m off to town old friend to present myself to mother she’ll never stop her bitter tears and mourning well i know till she sees me facetoface and for you i have some orders— take this luckless stranger to town so he can beg his supper there and whoever wants can give the man some crumbs and a cup to drink how can i put up with every passerby my mind’s weighed down with troubles if the stranger resents it all the worse for him i like to tell the truth and tell it straight” “my friend subtle odysseus broke in “i’ve no desire myself to linger here better that beggars cadge their meals in town than in the ﬁelds some willing soul will see to my needs i’m hardly ﬁt at my age to keep to a farm and jump to a foreman’s every order go on then this man will take me as you’ve told him once i’m warm from the ﬁre and the sun’s good and strong look at the clothing on my back—all rags and tatters i’m afraid the frost at dawn could do me in and town you say is a long hard way from here” at that telemachus strode down through the farm in quick ﬁrm strides brooding death for the suitors and once he reached his wellconstructed palace propping his spear against a sturdy pillar and crossing the stone threshold in he went his old nurse was the ﬁrst to see him eurycleia just spreading ﬂeeces over the carved inlaid chairs tears sprang to her eyes she rushed straight to the prince as the other maids of great od ysseus ﬂocked around him hugged him warmly kissed his head and shoulders now down from her chamber came discreet penelope looking for all the world like artemis or golden aphrodite— bursting into tears as she ﬂung her arms around her darling son and kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes and sobbed “y ou’re home telemachus”—words ﬂew from her heart— “sweet light of my eyes i ne ver thought i’d see you again once you shipped to pylos—against my will so secret out for news of your dear father quick tell me did you catch sight of the man—meet him—what” “please mother” steady telemachus replied “don’t move me to tears don’t stir the heart inside me i’ve just escaped from death sudden death no bathe now put on some fresh clothes go up to your own room with your servingwomen pray and promise the gods a generous sacriﬁce to bring success if zeus will ever grant us the hour of our revenge i myself am off to the meeting grounds to summon up a guest who came with me from abroad when i sailed home i sent him on ahead with my trusted crew i told piraeus to take him to his house treat him well host him with all good will till i could come myself” words to the mark that left his mother silent … she bathed now put on some fresh clothes prayed and promised the gods a generous sacriﬁce to bring success if zeus would ever grant the hour of their revenge spear in hand telemachus strode on through the hall and out and a pair of sleek hounds went trotting at his heels and athena lavished a marvelous splendor on the prince so the people all gazed in wonder as he came forward the swaggering suitors clustered milling round him welcome words on their lips and murder in their hearts but he gave them a wide berth as they came crowding in and there where mentor sat antiphus halitherses too— his father’s loyal friends from the early days— he took his seat as they pressed him with their questions and just then piraeus the gallant spearman approached leading the stranger through the town and out onto the meeting grounds telemachus not hanging back went right up to greet theoclymenus his guest but piraeus spoke out ﬁrst “quickly now telemachus send some women to my house to retrieve the gifts that menelaus gave you” “wait piraeus” wary telemachus cautioned “we’ve no idea how all of this will go if the brazen suitors cut me down in the palace— off guard—and carve apart my father’s whole estate i’d rather you yourself or one of his friends here keep those gifts and get some pleasure from them but if i can bring down slaughter on that crew you send the gifts to my house—we’ll share the joy” their plans made he led the wayworn stranger home and once they reached the wellconstructed palace spreading out their cloaks on a chair or bench into the burnished tubs they climbed and bathed when women had washed them rubbed them down with oil and drawn warm ﬂeece and shir ts around their shoulders out of the baths they stepped and sat on highbacked chairs a maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so they might rinse their hands then pulled a gleaming table to their side a staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them appetizers aplenty too lavish with her bounty penelope sat across from her son beside a pillar leaning back on a low chair and winding ﬁnespun yarn they reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they’d put aside desire for food and drink the queen for all her composure said at last “telemachus i’m going back to my room upstairs and lie down on my bed … that bed of pain my tears have streaked year in year out from the day odysseus sailed away to troy with atreus’ two sons but you you never had the heart— before those insolent suitors crowd back to the house— to tell me clearly about your father’s journey home if you’ve heard any news” “of course mother” thoughtful telemachus reassured her quickly “i will tell you the whole true story now we sailed to pylos to nestor the great king and he received me there in his lofty palace treated me well and warmly yes as a father treats a longlost son just home from voyaging years abroad such care he showered on me he and his noble sons but of strong enduring odysseus dead or alive he’s heard no news he said from any man on earth he sent me on to the famous spearman atrides menelaus on with a team of horses drawing a bolted chariot and there i saw her helen of argos—all for her achaeans and trojans suffered so much hardship thanks to the gods’ decree … the lord of the warcry menelaus asked at once what pressing need had brought me to lovely lacedaemon and when i told him the whole story ﬁrst to last the king burst out ‘how shameful that’s the bed of a brave man of war they’d like to crawl inside those spineless craven cowards weak as the doe that beds down her fawns in a mighty lion’s den—her newborn sucklings— then trails off to the mountain spurs and grassy bends to graze her ﬁll but back the lion comes to his own lair and the master deals both fawns a ghastly bloody death just what odysseus will deal that mob—ghastly death ah if only—father zeus athena and lord apollo— that man who years ago in the games at lesbos rose to philomelides’ challenge wrestled him pinned him down with one tremendous throw and the argives roared with joy … if only that odysseus sported with those suitors a blood wedding a quick death would take the lot but about the things you’ve asked me so intently i’ll skew and sidestep nothing not deceive you ever of all he told me—the old man of the sea who never lies— i’ll hide or hold back nothing not a single word he said he’d seen odysseus on an island ground down in misery off in a goddess’ house the nymph calypso who holds him there by force he has no way to voyage home to his own native land no trim ships in reach no crew to ply the oars and send him scudding over the sea’s broad back’ so menelaus the famous spearman told me my mission accomplished back i came at once and the gods sent me a stiff following wind that sped me home to the native land i love” his reassurance stirred the queen to her depths and the godlike seer theoclymenus added ﬁrmly “noble lady wife of laertes’ son odysseus menelaus can have no perfect revelations mark my words—i will make you a prophecy quite precise and i’ll hold nothing back i swear by zeus the ﬁrst of all the gods by this table of hospitality here my host by odysseus’ hearth where i have come for help— i swear odysseus is on native soil here and now poised or on the prowl learning of these rank crimes he’s sowing seeds of ruin for all your suitors so clear so true that birdsign i saw as i sat on the benched ship and sounded out the future to the prince” “if only my friend” reserved penelope exclaimed “everything you say would come to pass yo u ’ d s o o n k n o w m y a f f e c t i o n k n o w m y g i f t s any man you meet would call you blest” and so the three conﬁded in the halls while all the suitors before odysseus’ palace amused themselves with discus and long throwing spears out on the leveled grounds free and easy as always full of swagger when the dinnerhour approached and sheep came home from pastures near and far driven in by familiar drovers medon called them all their favorite herald always present at their meals “my young lords now you’ve played your games to your hearts’ content come back to the halls so we can ﬁx your supper nothing’s better than dining well on time” they came at his summons rising from the games and now bustling into the wellconstructed palace ﬂinging down their cloaks on a chair or bench they butchered hulking sheep and fatted goats fullgrown hogs and a young cow from the herd preparing for their feast at the same time the king and his loyal swineherd geared to leave the country for the town eumaeus foreman of men set things in motion “friend i know you’re keen on going down to town today just as my master bid though i’d rather you stay here to guard the farm but i prize the boy i fear he’ll blame me later— a dressingdown from your master’s hard to bear so off we go now the shank of the day is past yo u ’ l l ﬁ n d i t c o l d e r w i t h n i g h t f a l l c o m i n g o n ” “i know i see your point” the crafty man replied “there’s sense in this old head so let’s be off and from now on you lead me all the way just give me a stick to lean on if you have one readycut y ou say the road is treacherous full of slips and slides” with that he ﬂung his beggar’s sack across his shoulders— torn and tattered slung from a fraying rope eumaeus gave him a staff that met his needs then the two moved out leaving behind them dogs and herdsmen to stay and guard the farm and so the servant led his master toward the city looking for all the world like an old and broken beggar hunched on a stick his body wrapped in shameful rags … down over the rugged road they went till hard by town they reached the stonerimmed fountain running clear where the city people came and drew their water ithacus built it once wi th neritus and polyctor round it a stand of poplar thrived on the dank soil all in a nestling ring and down from a rockledge overhead the cold water splashed and crowning the fountain rose an altarstone erected to the nymphs where every traveler paused and left an offering here dolius’ son melanthius crossed their path herding his goats with a pair of drovers’ help the pick of his ﬂocks to make the suitors’ meal as soon as he saw them there he broke into a ﬂood of brutal foul abuse that made odysseus’ blood boil “look”—he sneered—”one scum nosing another scum along dirt ﬁnds dirt by the w ill of god—it never fails stinking pigboy where do you take your ﬁlthy swine this sickening beggar who licks the pots at feasts hanging round the doorposts rubbing his back scavenging after scraps no hero’s swords and cauldrons not for him hand him over to me—i’ll teach him to work a farm muck out my stalls pitch feed to the young goats whey to drink will put some muscle on his hams oh no he’s learned his lazy ways too well he’s got no itch to stick to good hard work he’d rather go scrounging round the countryside begging for crusts to stuff his greedy gut let me tell you—so help me it’s the truth— if he sets foot in king odysseus’ royal palace salvos of footstools ﬂung at his head by all the lords will crack his ribs as he runs th e line of ﬁre through the house” wild reckless taunts—and just as he passed odysseus the idiot lurched out with a heel and kicked his hip but he couldn’t knock the beggar off the path he stood his ground so staunchly odysseus was torn … should he wheel with his staff an d beat the scoundrel senseless— or hoist him by the midriff split his skull on the rocks he steeled himself instead his mind in full control but eumaeus glared at the goatherd cursed him to his face then lifted up his hands and prayed his heart out “o nymphs of the fountain daughters of zeus— if odysseus ever burned you the long thighs of lambs or kids covered with rich fat now bring my prayer to pass let that man come back—some god guide him now he’d toss to the winds the ﬂashy show you make melanthius so cocksure—always strutting round the town while worthless ﬁeldhands leave your ﬂocks a shambles” “listen to him ” the goatherd shouted back “a l l b a r k a n d n o b i t e f r o m t h e v i c i o u s m u t t one ﬁne day i’ll ship him out in a black lugger miles from ithaca—sell him off for a good stiff price just let apollo shoot telemachus down with his silver bow today in the halls or the suitors snuff his life out— as sure as i know the day of the king’s return is blotted out the king is worlds away” with his parting shot he left them trudging on and went and reached the royal house in no time slipping in he took his seat among the suitors facing eurymachus who favored him the most the carvers set before him his plate of meat a staid housekeeper brought the man his bread and now at last the king and loyal swineherd drawing near the palace halted just outside as the lyre’s rippling music drifted round them— phemius striking up a song for assembled guests— and the master seized his servant’s hand exclaiming “friend what a noble house odysseus’ house it must be no mistaking it—you could tell it among a townful look one building linked to the next and the courtyard wall is ﬁnished off with a ﬁne coping the double doors are battleproof—no man could break them down i can tell a crowd is feasting there in force— smell the savor of roasts … the ringing lyre listen the lyre that god has made the friend of feasts” “a n e a s y g u e s s ” y o u s a i d e u m a e u s s w i n e h e r d “for a man as keen as you at every turn put heads together what do we do next either you’re the ﬁrst one into the palace— mix with the suitors leave me where i am or if you like stay put and i’ll go ﬁrst myself don’t linger long someone might spot you here outside knock you down or pelt you mark my words take care” the man who’d borne long years abroad replied “well i know remember there’s sense in this old head yo u g o i n y o u ﬁ r s t w h i l e i s t a y h e r e b e h i n d stones and blows and i are hardly strangers my heart is steeled by now i’ve had my share of pain in the waves and wars add this to the total bring the trial on but there’s no way to hide the belly’s hungers— what a curse what mischief it brews in all our lives just for hunger we rig and ride our long benched ships on the barren salt sea speeding death to enemies” now as they talked on a dog that lay there lifted up his muzzle pricked his ears … it was argos longenduring odysseus’ dog he trained as a puppy once but little joy he got since all too soon he shipped to sacred troy in the old days young hunters loved to set him coursing after the wild goats and deer and hares but now with his master gone he lay there castaway on piles of dung from mules and cattle heaps collecting out before the gates till odysseus’ servingmen could cart it off to manure the king’s estates infested with ticks halfdead from neglect here lay the hound old argos but the moment he sensed odysseus standing by he thumped his tail nuzzling low and his ears dropped though he had no strength to drag himself an inch toward his master odysseus glanced to the side and ﬂicked away a tear hiding it from eumaeus diverting his friend in a hasty offhand way “strange eumaeus look a dog like this lying here on a dunghill … what handsome lines but i can’t say for sure if he had the running sp eed to match his looks or he was only the sort that gentry spoil at table showdogs masters pamper for their points” yo u t o l d t h e s t r a n g e r e u m a e u s l o y a l s w i n e h e r d “here—it’s all too true—here’s the dog of a man who died in foreign parts but if he had now the form and ﬂair he had in his glory days— as odysseus left him sailing off to troy— you’d be amazed to see such speed such strength no quarry he chased in the deepest darkest woods could ever slip this hound a champion tracker too ah but he’s run out of luck now poor fellow … his master’s dead and gone so far from home and the heartless women tend him not at all slaves with their lords no longer there to crack the whip lose all zest to perform their duties well zeus the old thunderer robs a man of half his virtue the day the yoke clamps down around his neck” with that he entered the wellconstructed palace strode through the halls and joined the proud suitors but the dark shadow of death closed down on argos’ eyes the instant he saw odysseus twenty years away now prince telemachus ﬁrst by far to note the swineherd coming down the hall nodded briskly called and waved him on eu maeus glancing about picked up a handy stool where the carver always sat slicing meat for the suitors feasting through the house he took and put it beside the prince’s table facing him straddled it himself as a st eward set a plate of meat before the man and served him bread from trays right behind him came odysseus into his own house looking for all the world like an old and broken beggar hunched on a stick his body wrapped in shameful rags just in the doorway just at the ashwood threshold there he settled down … leaning against the cypress post a master joiner planed smooth and hung with a plumb line years ago telemachus motioned the swineherd over now and choosing a whole loaf from a ﬁne wicker tray and as much meat as his outstretched hands could hold he said “now take these to the stranger tell him too to make the rounds of the suitors beg from one and all bashfulness for a man in need is no great friend” and eumaeus did his bidding went straight up to the guest and winged a greeting “here stranger prince telemachus sends you these and tells you too to make the rounds of the suitors beg from one and all bashfulness for a beggar he says is no great friend” “powerful zeus” the crafty king responded “grant that your prince be blest among mankind— and all his heart’s desires come to pass” taking the food in both hands setting it down spread out on his ﬁlthy sack before his feet the beggar fell to his meal as the singer raised a song throughout the house once he’d supped and the stirring bard had closed the suitors broke into uproar down along the hall and now athena came to the side of laertes’ royal son and urged him “go now gather crusts from all the suitors test them so we can tell the innocent from the guilty” but not even so would athena save one man from death still off he went begging from each in turn circling left to right reaching out his hand like a beggar from the day that he was born they pitied him gave him scraps were puzzled too asking each other “who is this” “where’s he from” till the goatherd melanthius shouted out in their midst “listen to me you lords who court our noble queen— i’ll tell you about the stranger i’ve seen him before i know for a fact the swineherd led him in though i have no idea who the fellow is or where he thinks he comes from” at that antinous wheeled on eumaeus lashing out at him “y our highness swineherd—why drag this to town haven’t we got our share of vagabonds to deal with disgusting beggars who lick the feasters’ plates isn’t it quite enough these swarming crowds consuming your master’s bounty— must you invite this rascal in the bargain” “a n t i n o u s highborn as you are” you told the man eumaeus “that was a mean low speech now who’d go out who on his own hook— not i—and ask a stranger in from nowhere unless he had some skills to serve the house a prophet a healer who cures disease a worker in wood or even a godinspired bard whose singing warms the heart— they’re the ones asked in around the world a beggar who’d invite a beggar to bleed his household white yo u y o u o f a l l t h e s u i t o r s a r e a l w a y s r o u g h e s t on the servants of our king on me most of all not that i care no so long as his queen his wise queen is still alive in the palace prince telemachus too” “stop eumaeus” poised telemachus broke in quickly now “don’t waste so much breath on antinous here it’s just his habit to bait a man with abuse and spur the rest as well” he wheeled on the suitor letting loose “how kind you are to me antinous kind as a father to his son encouraging me to send this stranger packing from my house with a harsh command i’d never do it god forbid take and give to the beggar i don’t grudge it— i’d even urge you on no scruples now never fear your gifts will upset my mother or any servant in king odysseus’ royal house but no such qualm could enter that head of yours bent on feeding your own face not feeding strangers” antinous countered the young prince in kind “so high and mighty telemachus—such unbridled rage if all the suitors gave him the sort of gift i’ll give the house would be rid of him for three whole months” with that from under his table be seized the stool that propped his smooth feet as he reveled on— just lifting it into view … but as for the rest all gave to the beggar ﬁlled his sack with handouts bread and meat and odysseus seemed at the point of getting back to his doorsill done with testing suitors home free himself when he stopped beside antinous begging facetoface “give me a morsel friend y ou’re hardly the worst achaean here it seems th e noblest one in fact yo u l o o k l i k e a k i n g t o m e so you should give a bigger crust than the rest and i will sing your praises all across the earth i too once lived in a lofty house that men admired rolling in wealth i’d often gi ve to a vagabond like myself whoever he was whatever need had brought him to my door and crowds of servants i had and lots of all it takes to live the life of ease to make men call you rich but zeus ruined it all—god’s will no doubt— when he shipped me off with a roving band of pirates bound for egypt a long hard sail to wreck my life there in the nile delta i moored our ships of war god knows i ordered my trusty crews to stand by just where they were and guard the anchored ﬂeet and i sent a patrol to scout things out from higher ground but swept away by their own reckless fury the crew went berserk— they promptly began to plunder the lush egyptian farms dragged off the women and children killed the men outcries reached the city in no time—stirred by shouts the entire town came streaming down at the break of day ﬁlling the river plain with chariots ranks of infantry and the gleam of bronze zeus who loves the lightning ﬂung down murderous panic on all my menatarms— no one dared to stand his ground and ﬁght disaster ringed us round from every quarter droves of my men they hacked down with swords led off the rest alive to labor for them as slaves myself they passed me on to a stranger come their way to ship me to cyprus—iasus’ son dmetor it was who ruled cyprus then with an iron ﬁst and from there i sailed to ithaca just as you see me now ground down by pain and sorrow—” “good god almighty” antino us cut the beggar short “what spirit brought this pest to plague our feast back off into the open clear of my table or you you’ll soon land in an egypt cyprus to break your heart what a brazen shameless beggar scrounging food from each man in turn and look at their handouts reckless never a qualm no holding back not when making free with the next man’s goods— each one’s got plenty here” “pity pity” the wry odysseus countered drawing away “no sense in your head to match your handsome looks yo u ’ d g r u d g e y o u r s e r v a n t a p i n c h o f s a l t f r o m y o u r o w n l a r d e r you who lounge at the next man’s board but lack the heart to tear a crust of bread and hand it on to me though there’s god’s plenty here” boiling over antinous gave him a scathing look and let ﬂy “now you won’t get out of the hall unscarred i swear not after such a ﬁlthy string of insults” with that he seized the stool and hurled it— square in the back it struck odysseus just under the right shoulder but he stood up against it—steady as a rock unstaggered by antinous’ blow—just shook his head silent his mind churning wi th thoughts of bloody work back he went to the doorsill crouched and setting down his sack about to burst he faced the suitors saying “hear me out you lords who court the noble queen i must say what the heart inside me urges there’s nothing to groan about no hurt when a man takes a blow as he ﬁghts to save his own possessions cattle or shining ﬂocks but antinous struck me all because of my goodfornothing belly—that that curse that makes such pain for us poor men but if beggars have their gods and furies too let antinous meet his death before he meets his bride” “enough stranger” antinous volleyed back “sit there and eat in peace—or go get lost or else for the way you talk these young men will hale you up and down the halls by your hands or feet until you’re skinned alive” naked threats— but the rest were outraged even those brash suitors one would say to another “look antinous that was a crime to strike the luckless beggar” “y our fate is sealed if he’s some god from the blue” “a n d t h e g o d s d o t a k e o n t h e l o o k o f s t r a n g e r s dropping in from abroad—” “disguised in every way as they roam and haunt our cities watching over us—” “a l l o u r f o u l p l a y a l l o u r f a i r p l a y t o o ” so they warned but antinous paid no heed and the anguish welled up in telemachus’ breast for the blow his father took yet he let no tears go rolling down his face—just shook his head silent his mind churning wi th thoughts of bloody work but then when cautious queen penelope heard how antinous struck the stranger there in the halls she cried out with her servingwomen round her “may apollo the archer strike you just as hard” and her housekeeper eurynome added quickly “if only our prayers were granted— then not one of the lot would live to see dawn climb her throne tomorrow” “dear old woman” alert penelope replied “they’re all hateful plotting their vicious plots but antinous is the worst of all—he’s black death itself here’s this luckless stranger wandering down the halls and begging scraps—hardpressed by need— and the rest all give the man his ﬁll of food but that one gives him a footstool hurled at his right shou lder hits his back” while she exclaimed among her household women sitting there in her room odysseus bent to supper penelope called the swineherd in and gave instructions “go good eumaeus tell the stranger to come at once i’d like to give him a warm welcome ask the man if he’s heard some news about my gallant husband or seen him in the ﬂesh … he seems like one who’s roved around the world” “my queen” you answered eu maeus loyal swineherd “if only the lords would hold their peace a moment such stories he tells—he’d charm you to your depths three nights three days i kept him in my shelter i was the ﬁrst the fellow stumbled onto ﬂeeing from some ship but not even so could he bring his tale of troubles to an end yo u k n o w h o w y o u c a n s t a r e a t a b a r d i n w o n d e r — trained by the gods to sing and hold men spellbound— how you can long to sit there listening all your life when the man begins to sing so he charmed my heart i tell you huddling there beside me at my ﬁre he and odysseus’ father go way back he says sworn friends and the stranger hails from crete where the stock of old king minos still lives on and from crete he made his way racked by hardship tumbling on like a rolling stone until he turned up here he swears he’s heard of odysseus—just in reach in rich thesprotian country—still alive laden with treasure heading home at last” “go” the cautious queen responded “call him here so he can tell me his own tale facetoface our friends can sit at the gates or down the halls and play their games debauched to their hearts’ content why not their own stores their bread and seasoned wine lie intact at home food for their servingmen alone but they they infest our palace day and night they butcher our cattle our sheep our fat goats feasting themselves sick swilling our glowing wine as if there’s no tomorrow—all of it squandered no there is no man like odysseus in command to drive this curse from the house dear god if only odysseus came back home to native soil now he and his son would avenge the outrage of these men—like that ” at her last words telemachus shook with a lusty sneeze and the sudden outburst echoed up and down the halls the queen was seized with laughter calling out to eumaeus winged words “quickly go bring me this stranger now facetoface yo u h e a r h o w m y s o n s e a l e d a l l i s a i d w i t h a s n e e z e so let death come down with grim ﬁnality on these suitors— one and all—not a single man escape his sudden doom and another thing mark my words i tell you if i’m convinced that all he says is true i’ll dress him in shirt and cloak in handsome clothes” off the swineherd went following her instructions made his way to the stranger’s side and winged a word “old friend—our queen wise penelope summons you the prince’s mother the spirit moves her now heartsick as she is to ask a question or two about her husband and if she’s convinced that all you say is true she’ll dress you in shirt and cloak that’s what you need that most of all now bread you can always beg around the country ﬁll your belly well— they’ll give you food whoever has a mind to” “gladly eumaeus” the patient man replied “i’ll tell her the whole truth and nothing but icarius’ daughter your wise queen penelope i know all about that man … it’s been my lot to suffer what he’s suffered but i fear the mob’s abuse those rough young bucks their pride and violence hit the iron skies just now that scoundrel—as i went down the halls harming no one—up and dealt me a jolting blow and who would raise a hand to save me telemachus anyone else no one so tell penelope now anxious as she may be to wait in the halls until the sun goes down then she can ask me all she likes about her husband’s journey home but let her give me a seat close by the ﬁre the clothes on my back are tatters well you know— you are the ﬁrst i begged for care and shelter” back the swineherd went following his instructions penelope just as he crossed her threshold broke out “didn’t you bring him what’s in the vagrant’s mind fear of someone embarrassed by something else here in the house is the fellow bashful a bashful man will make a sorry beggar” yo u a n s w e r e d y o u r q u e e n e u m a e u s l o y a l s w i n e h e r d “he talks to the point—he thinks as the next man would who wants to dodge their blows that brutal crew he tells you to wait here till the sun goes down it’s better for you my queen then you can talk with the man in private hear the stranger’s news” “nobody’s fool that stranger” wise penelope said “he sees how things could go surely no men on earth can match that gang for reckless deadly schemes” so she agreed and now mission accomplished back the loyal swineherd went to mix with the suitors moving next to the prince he whispered a parting word their heads close together so no one else could hear “dear boy i must be off to see to the pigs and the whole farm—your living mine as well y ou’re the one to tend to all things here look out for your own skin ﬁrst do take care you mustn’t come to grief crowds of your own countrymen plot your death— let zeus wipe out the lot before they kill us all” “right you are old friend” the canny prince replied “now off you go once you’ve had your supper but come back bright and early bring some good sound boars for slaughter y es i’ll tend to all things here i and the deathless gods” and the swineherd sat down again on his polished stool and once he’d supped and drunk to his heart’s content back he went to his pigs leaving the royal precincts still ﬁlled with feasters all indulging now in the joys of dance and song the day was over dusk was falling fast book xviii the beggarking of ithaca now along came this tramp this public nuisance who used to scrounge a living round the streets of ithaca— notorious for his belly a ravenous bottomless pit for food and drink but he had no pith no brawn despite the looming hulk that met your eyes arnaeus was his name so his worthy mother called him at birth but all the young men called him irus for short because he’d hustle messages at any beck and call well he came by to rout the king from his own house and met odysseus now with a rough abusive burst “get off the porch you old goat before i haul you off by the leg can’t you see them give me the wink all of them here to drag you out—and so i would but i’ve got some pangs of conscience up with you man or before you know it we’ll be trading blows” a killing look and the wily old soldier countered “out of your mind what damage have i done you what have i said i don’t grudge you anything not if the next man up and gives you plenty this doorsill is big enough for the both of us— you’ve got no call to grudge me what’s not yours yo u ’r e a n o t h e r v a g r a n t j u s t l i k e m e i ’ d s a y and it lies with the gods to make us rich or poor so keep your ﬁsts to yourself don’t press your luck don’t rile me or old as i am i’ll bloody your lip splatter your chest and buy myself some peac e and quiet for tomorrow i doubt you’ll ever come lumbering back again to the halls of laertes’ royal son odysseus” “look who’s talking” the beggar rumbled in anger “how this potbellied pig runs off at the mouth— like an old crone at her oven well ’ve got a knockout blow in store for him — i’ll batter the tramp with both ﬁsts bash every tooth from his jaws i’ll litter the ground with teeth like a rogue sow’s punished for rooting corn belt up—so the lords can see us ﬁght it out how can you beat a champion half your age” tonguelashing each ot her tempers ﬂaring there on the polished sill before the lofty doors and antinous that grand prince hearing them wrangle broke into gloating laughter calling to the suitors “friends nothing like this has come our way before— what sport some god has brought the palace now the stranger and irus look they’d battle it out together ﬁsts ﬂying come let’s pit them against each other—fast” all leapt from their seats with whoops of laughter clustering round the pair of ragged beggars there as eupithes’ son antinous planned the contest “quiet my ﬁne friends here’s what i propose these goat sausages sizzling here in the ﬁre— we packed them with fat and blood to have for supper now whoever wins this bout and proves the stronger let that man step up and take his pick of the lot what’s more from this day on he feasts among us— no other beggar will we allow inside to cadge his meals from us” they all cheered but odysseus foxy veteran plotted on … “friends how can an old man worn down with pain stand up to a young buck it’s just this belly of mine this troublemaker tempts me to take a licking so ﬁrst all of you swear me a binding oath come not one of you steps in for irus here strikes me a foul blow to pull him through and lays me in the dust” and at that they all mouthed the oath that he required and once they vowed they’d never interfere prince telemachus drove the matter home “stranger if your spine and ﬁghting pride prompt you to go against this fellow now have no fear of any suitor in the pack— whoever fouls you will have to face a crowd count on me your host and two lords back me up antinous and eurymachus—both are men of sense” they all shouted approval of the prince as odysseus belted up roping his rags around his loins baring his big rippling thighs—his boxer’s broad shoulders his massive chest and burly arms on full display as athena stood beside him ﬂeshing out the limbs of the great commander … despite their swagger the suitors were amazed gaping at one another trading forecasts “irus will soon be ironed out for good” “he’s in for the beating he begged for all along” “look at the ham on that old gaffer—” “just under his rags” each outcry jolted irus to the core—too late the servants trussed his clothes up dragged him on the ﬂesh on his body quaking now with terror antinous rounded on him ﬂinging insults “y ou you clumsy ox you’re better off dead or never born at all if you cringe at him paralyzed with fear of an old broken hulk ground down by the pains that hound his steps mark my word—so help me i’ll make it good— if that old relic whips you and wins the day i’ll toss you into a black ship and sail you off to echetus the mainland king who wrecks all men alive he’ll lop your nose and ears with his ruthless blade he’ll rip your privates out by the roots he will and serve them up to his dogs to bolt down raw” that threat shook his knees with a stronger ﬁt but they hauled him into the ring both men put up their ﬁsts— with the seasoned ﬁghter odysseus deeply torn now … should he knock him senseless leave him dead where he dropped or just stretch him out on the ground with a light jab as he mulled things over that way seemed the best a glancing blow the suitors would not detect him the two men squared off— and irus hurled a ﬁst at odysseus’ right shoulder as he came through with a hook below the ear pounding irus’ neck smashing the bones inside— suddenly red blood came spurting out of his mouth and headlong down he pitched in the dust howling teeth locked in a grin feet beating the ground— and the princely suitors ﬂinging their hands in the air died laughing grabbing him by the leg odysseus hauled him through the porch across the yard to the outer gate heaped him against the courtyard wall sitting slumped stuck his stick in his hand and gave him a parting shot “now hold your post—play the scarecrow to all the pigs and dogs but no more lording it over strangers no more playing the beggarking for you you loathsome fool or you’ll bring down something worse around your neck” he threw his beggar’s sack across his shoulders— torn and tattered slung from a fraying rope— then back he went to the sill and took his seat the suitors ambled back as well laughing jauntily toasting the beggar warmly now those proud young blades one man egging the other on “stranger friend may zeus and the other deathless gods ﬁll up your sack with blessings” “a l l y o u r h e a r t d e s i r e s ” “y ou’ve knocked him out of action that insatiable tramp—” “that parasite on the land” “ship him off to echetus fast—the mainland king who wrecks all men alive” welcome words and a lucky omen too—odysseus’ heart leapt up antinous laid before him a generous goat sausage bubbling fat and blood amphinomus took two loaves from the wicker tray and set them down beside him drank his health in a golden cup and said “cheers old friend old father saddled now as you are with so much trouble— here’s to your luck great days from this day on” and the one who knew the world replied at length “a m p h i n o m u s y o u s e e m l i k e a man of good sense to me just like your father—at least i’ve heard his praises nisus of dulichion a righteous man and rich yo u ’r e h i s s o n t h e y s a y y o u s e e m w e l l s p o k e n t o o so i will tell you something listen listen closely of all that breathes and crawls across the earth our mother earth breeds nothing feebler than a man so long as the gods grant him power spring in his knees he thinks he will never suffer afﬂiction down the years but then when the happy gods br ing on the long hard times bear them he must against his will and steel his heart our lives our mood and mind as we pass across the earth turn as the days turn … as the father of men and gods makes each day dawn i too seemed destined to be a man of fortune once and a wild wicked swath i cut indulged my lust for violence staking all on my father and my brothers look at me now and so i say let no man ever be lawless all his life just take in peace what gifts the gods will send true but here i see you suitors plotting your reckless work carving away at the wealth affronting the loyal wife of a man who won’t be gone from kin and country long i say he’s right at hand—and may some power save you spirit you home before you meet him facetoface the moment he returns to native ground once under his own roof he and your friends believe you me won’t part till blood has ﬂowed” with that he poured out honeyed wine to the gods and drank deeply then restored the cup to the young prince’s hands amphinomus made his way back through the hall heart sick with anguish shaking his head fraught with grave forebodings … but not even so could he escape his fate even then athena had bound him fast to death at the hands of prince telemachus and his spear now back he went to the seat that he’d left empty but now the goddess athena with her glinting eyes inspired penelope icarius’ daughter wary poised to display herself to her suitors fan their hearts inﬂame them more and make her even more esteemed by her husband and her son than she had been before forcing a laugh she called her maid “eurynome my spirit longs—though it never did till now— to appear before my suitors loathe them as i do i’d say a word to my son too for his own good not to mix so much with that pernicious crowd so glib with their friendly talk but plotting wicked plots they’ll hatch tomorrow” “well said my child” the old woman answered “all to the point go to the boy and warn him now hold nothing back but ﬁrst you should bathe yourself give a gloss to your face don’t go down like that— your eyes dimmed your cheeks streaked with tears it makes things worse this grieving on and on y our son’s now come of age—your fondest prayer to the deathless gods to see him wear a beard” “eurynome” discreet penelope objected “don’t try to coax me care for me as you do to bathe myself refresh my face with oils whatever glow i had died long ago … the gods of olympus snuffed it out that day my husband sailed away in the hollow ships but please have autonoe and hippodamia come and support me in the hall i’ll never brave those men alone i’d be too embarrassed” now as the old nurse bustled through the house to give the women orders call them to the queen the brighteyed goddess thought of one more thing she drifted a sound slumber over icarius’ daughter back she sank and slept her limbs fell limp and still reclining there on her couch all the while athena luminous goddess lavished immortal gifts on her to make her suitors lose themselves in wonder … the divine unguent ﬁrst she cleansed her cheeks her brow and ﬁne eyes with ambrosia smooth as the oils the goddess love applies donning her crown of ﬂowers whenever she joins the graces’ captivating dances she made her taller fuller in form to all men’s eyes her skin whiter than ivory freshly carved and now athena’s mission accomplished off the bright one went as barearmed maids came in from their own quarters chattering all the way an d sleep released the queen she woke touched her cheek with a hand and mused “ ah what a marvelous gentle sleep enfolding me in the midst of all my anguish now if only blessed artemis sent me a death as gentle now this instant—no more wasting away my life my heart broken in longing for my husband … he had every strength rising over his countrym en head and shoulders” then leaving her welllit chamber she descended not alone two of her women followed close behind that radiant woman once she reached her suitors drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side the suitors’ knees went slack their hearts dissolved in lust— all of them lifted prayers to lie beside her share her bed but turning toward her son she warned “telemachus your sense of balance is not what it used to be when you were a boy you had much better judgment now that you’ve grown and reached your young prime and any stranger seeing how tall and handsome you are would think you the son of some great man of wealth— now your sense of fairness seems to fail you consider the dreadful thing just done in our halls— how you let the stranger be so abused why suppose our guest sitting here at peace here in our own house were hauled and badly hurt by such cruel treatment yo u ’d be shamed disgraced in all men’s eyes” “mother …” telemachus paused then answered “i cannot fault your anger at all this my heart takes note of everything feels it too both the good and the bad—the boy you knew is gone but how can i plan my world in a sane thoughtful way these men drive me mad hedging me round right and left plotting their lethal plots and no one takes my side still this battle between the stranger and irus hardly went as the suitors might have hoped the stranger beat him down if only—father zeus athena and lord apollo— these gallants now this moment here in our house were battered senseless heads lolling knees unstrung some sprawled in the courtyard some sprawled outside slumped like irus down at the front gates now whipped and his head rolling like some drunk he can’t stand up on his feet and stagger home whatever home he’s got—the man’s demolished” so penelope and her son exchanged their hopes as eurymachus stepped in to praise the queen “a h d a u g h t e r o f i c a r i u s w i s e p e n e l o p e if all the princes in ionian argos saw you now what a troop of suitors would banquet in your halls tomorrow at sunrise y ou surpass all women in build and beauty reﬁned and steady mind” “oh no eurymachus” wise penelope demurred “whatever form and feature i had what praise i’d won the deathless gods destroyed that day the achaeans sailed away to troy my husband in their ships odysseus—if he could return to tend my life the renown i had would only grow in glory now my life is torment … look at the griefs some god has loosed against me i’ll never forget the day he left this land of ours he caught my right hand by the wrist and said gently ‘dear woman i doubt that every achaean under arms will make it home from troy all safe and sound the trojans they say are ﬁne soldiers too hurling javelins shooting ﬂights of arrows charioteers who can turn the tide—like that— when the great leveler war brings on some deadlock so i cannot tell if the gods will sail me home again or i’ll go down out there on the ﬁelds of troy but all things here must rest in your control watch over my father and mother in the palace just as now or perhaps a little more when i am far from home but once you see the beard on the boy’s cheek you wed the man you like and leave your house behind’ so my husband advised me then now it all comes true … a night will come when a hateful marriage falls my lot— this cursed life of mine zeus has torn away my joy but there’s something else that mortiﬁes me now yo u r w a y i s a f a r c r y f r o m t h e t i m e h o n o r e d w a y of suitors locked in rivalry striving to win some noble woman a wealthy man’s daughter they bring in their own calves and lambs to feast the friends of the bridetobe yes and shower her with gleaming gifts as well they don’t devour the woman’s goods scotfree” staunch odysseus glowed with joy to hear all this— his wife’s trickery luring gifts from her suitors now enchanting their hearts with suave seductive words but all the while with something else in mind “gifts” eupithes’ son antinous took her point at once “daughter of icarius sensible penelope whatever gifts your suitors would like to bring accept them how ungracious to turn those gifts away we won’t go back to our own estates or anywhere else till you have wed the man you ﬁnd the best” so he proposed and all the rest agreed each suitor sent a page to go and get a gift antinous’ man brought in a grand resplendent robe stiff with embroidery clasped with twelve gold brooches long pins that clipped into sheathing loops with ease eurymachus’ man brought in a necklace richly wrought gilded strung with amber and glowing like the sun eurydamas’ two men came wi th a pair of earrings mulberry clusters dangling in triple drops with a glint to catch the heart from the halls of lord pisander polyctor’s son a servant brought a choker a ﬁne gleaming treasure and so each suitor in turn laid on a handsome gift then the noble queen withdrew to her upper room her ﬁle of waiting ladies close behind her bearing the gorgeous presents in their arms now the suitors turned to dance and song to the lovely beat and sway waiting for dusk to come upon them there … and the dark night came upon them lost in pleasure they rushed to set up three braziers along the walls to give them light piled them high with kindling sere wellseasoned just split with an ax and mixed in chips to keep the torches ﬂaring the maids of odysseus steady man took turns to keep the ﬁres up but the king himself dear to the gods and cunning to the core gave them orders brusquely “maids of odysseus your master gone so long—quick now off you go to the room where your queen and mistress waits sit with her there and try to lift her spirits combing wool in your hands or spinning yarn but i will trim the torches for all her suitors even if they would like to revel on till morning mounts her throne they’ll never wear me down i have a name for lasting out the worst” at that the women burst into laughter glancing back and forth flushed with beauty melantho mocked him shamelessly— dolius was her father but penelope brought her up she treated her like her own child and gave her toys to cheer her heart but despite that her heart felt nothing for all her mistress’ anguish now she was eurymachus’ lover always slept with him she was the one who mocked her king and taunted “cock of the walk did someone beat your brains out why not go bed down at the blacksmith’s cozy forge or a public place where tramps collect why here— blithering on nonstop bold as brass in the face of all these lords no fear in your heart wine’s got to your wits— or do you always play the fool and babble nonsense lost your head have you because you drubbed that hobo irus yo u w a i t — a b e t t e r m a n t h a n i r u s w i l l t a k e y o u o n he’ll box both sides of your skull with heavy ﬁsts and cart you out the palace gushing blood” “yo u wait you bitch”—the hardened veteran ﬂashed a killing look “i’ll go straight to the prince with your foul talk the prince will chop you to pieces here and now” his fury sent the women ﬂuttering off scattering down the hall with panic shaking every limb— they knew he spoke the truth but he took up his post by the ﬂaring braziers tending the ﬁres closely looking after them all though the heart inside him stirred with other things ranging ahead now to all that must be done … but athena had no mind to let the brazen suitors hold back now from their heartrending insults— she meant to make the anguish cut still deeper into the core of laertes’ son odysseus polybus’ son eurymachus launched in ﬁrst baiting the king to give his friends a laugh “listen to me you lords who court our noble queen i simply have to say what’s on my mind look surely the gods have fetched this beggar here to odysseus’ house at least our torchlight seems to come from the sheen of the man’s own head— there’s not a hair on his bald pate not a wisp” then he wheeled on odysseus raider of cities “stranger how would you like to work for me if i took you on—i’d gi ve you decent wages— picking the stones to lay a tight dry wall or planting tall trees on the edge of my estate i’d give you rations to last you yearround clothes for your body sandals for your feet oh no you’ve learned your lazy ways too well you’ve got no itch to stick to good hard work you’d rather go scrounging round the countryside begging for crusts to stuff your greedy gut” “a h e u r y m a c h u s ” o d y s s e u s m a s t e r o f m a n y e x p l o i t s answered ﬁrmly “if only the two of us could go mantoman in the labors of the ﬁeld … in the late spring when the long days come round out in the meadow i swinging a wellcurved scythe and you swinging yours—we’d test our strength for work fasting right till dusk with lots of hay to mow or give us a team of oxen to drive purebreds hulking ruddy beasts both lusty with fodder paired for age and pullingpower that never ﬂags— with four acres to work the loam churning under the plow— you’d see what a straight unbroken furrow i could cut you then or if zeus would bring some battle on—out of the blue this very day—and give me a shield and two spears and a bronze helmet to ﬁt this soldier’s temples then you’d see me ﬁght where front ranks clash— no more mocking this belly of mine not then enough y ou’re sick with pride you brutal fool no doubt you count yourself a great powerful man because you sport with a puny crowd illbred to boot if only odysseus came back home and stood right here in a ﬂash you’d ﬁnd those doors—broad as they are— too cramped for your race to safety through the porch” that made eurymachus’ fury seethe and burst— he gave the beggar a dark look and let ﬂy “y ou you odious—i’ll make you pay for your ugly rant bold as brass in the face of all these lords no fear in your heart wine’s got to your wits— or do you always play the fool and babble nonsense lost your head have you because you drubbed that hobo irus” as he shouted out he seized a stool but odysseus fearing the blow crouched at amphinomus’ knees as eurymachus hurled and hit the winesteward clipping his right hand— his cup dropped clattered along the ﬂoor and ﬂat on his back he went groaning in the dust the suitors broke into uproar through the shadowed halls glancing at one another trading angry outcries “would to god this drifter had dropped dead—” “a n y w h e r e e l s e b e f o r e h e l a n d e d h e r e ” “then he’d never have loosed such pandemonium” “now we’re squabbling over beggars ” “no more joy in the sumptuous feast …” “now riot rules the day” but now prince telemachus dressed them down “fools you’re out of your minds no hiding it food and wine have gone to your heads some god has got your blood up come now you’ve eaten well go home to bed—when the spirit moves that is i for one i’ll drive no guest away” so he declared and they all bit their lips amazed the prince could speak with so much daring at last amphinomus rose to take the ﬂoor the noted son of nisus king aretias’ grandson “fair enough my friends when a man speaks well we have no grounds for wrangling no cause for abuse hands off the stranger and any other servant in king odysseus’ palace come steward pour ﬁrst drops for the god in every cup let’s make libations then go home to bed the stranger leave him here in odysseus’ halls and have his host telemachus tend him well— it’s the prince’s royal house the man has reached” so he said his proposal pleased them all and gallant mulius a herald of dulichion a friendinarms of lord amphinomus too mixed the men a bowl and hovering closely poured full rounds for all they tipped cups to the blissful gods and then libations made they drank the heady wine to their hearts’ content and went their ways to bed each suitor to his house book xix penelope and her guest that left the great odysseus waiting in his hall as athena helped him plot the slaughter of the suitors he turned at once to telemachus brisk with orders “now we must stow the weap ons out of reach my boy all the arms and armor—and when the suitors miss them and ask you questions put them off with a winning story ‘i stowed them away clear of the smoke a far cry from the arms odysseus left when he went to troy ﬁredamaged equipment black with reeking fumes and a god reminded me of something darker too when you’re in your cups a quarrel might break out you’d wound each other shame your feasting here and cast a pall on your courting iron has powers to draw a man to ruin’ “ telemachus did his father’s will at once calling out to his old nurse eurycleia “quick dear one close the women up in their own quarters till i can stow my father’s weapons in the storeroom splendid gear lying about neglected black with soot since father sailed away i was only a boy then now i must safeguard them from the smoke” “high time child” the loving nurse replied “if only you’d bother to tend your whole house and safeguard all your treasures tell me who’s to fetch and carry the torch for you yo u w o n’ t l e t o u t t h e m a i d s w h o ’ d l i g h t y o u r w a y ” “our friend here will” telemachus answered coolly “i won’t put up with a man who shirks his work not if he takes his ration from my stores even if he’s miles away from home” that silenced the old nurse she barred the doors that led from the long hall— and up they sprang odysseus and his princely son and began to carry off the helmets studded shields and pointed spears and pallas athena strode before them lifting a golden lamp that cast a dazzling radiance round about “father” telemachus suddenly burst out to odysseus “oh what a marvel ﬁlls my eyes look look there— all the sides of the hall the handsome crossbeams pinewood rafters the tall columns towering— all glow in my eyes like ﬂaming ﬁre surely a god is here— one of those who rule the vaulting skies” “quiet” his father the old soldier warned him “get a grip on yourself no more questions now it’s just the way of the gods who rule olympus off you go to bed i’ll stay here behind to test the women test your mother too she in her grief will ask me everything i know” under the ﬂaring torch light through the hall telemachus made his way to his own bedroom now where he always went when welcome sleep came on him there he lay tonight as well till dawn’s ﬁrst light that left the great king still waiting in his hall as athena helped him plot the slaughter of the suitors … now down from her chamber came reserved penelope looking for all the world like artemis or golden aphrodite close to the ﬁre her women drew her favorite chair with its whorls of silver and ivory inlaid rings the craftsman who made it years ago icmalius added a footrest under the seat itself mortised into the frame and over it all was draped a heavy ﬂeece here penelope took her place discreet observant the women arms bared pressing in from their quarters cleared away the tables the heaped remains of the feast and the cups from which the raucous lords had drunk raking embers from the braziers onto the ground they piled them high again with seasoned wood providing light and warmth and yet again melantho lashed out at odysseus “y ou still here— you pest slinking around the house all night leering up at the women get out you tramp—be glad of the food you got— or we’ll sling a torch at you rout you out at once” a killing glance and the old trooper countered “what’s possessed you woman why lay into me such abuse just because i’m ﬁlthy because i wear such rags roving round the country living handtomouth but it’s fate that drives me on that’s the lot of beggars homeless drifters i too once lived in a lofty house that men admired rolling in wealth i’d often gi ve to a vagabond like myself whoever he was whatever need had brought him to my door and crowds of servants i had and lots of all it takes to live the life of ease to make men call you rich but zeus ruined it all—god’s will no doubt so beware woman or one day you may lose it all all your glitter that puts your workmates in the shade or your mistress may just ﬂy in a rage and dress you down or odysseus may return—there’s still room for hope or if he’s dead as you think and never coming home well there’s his son telemachus … like father like son—thanks to god apollo no women’s wildness here in the house escapes the prince’s eye he’s come of age at last” so he warned and alert penelope heard him wheeled on the maid and tonguelashed her smartly “make no mistake you br azen shameless bitch none of your ugly work escapes me either— you will pay for it with your life you will how well you knew—you heard from my own lips— that i meant to probe this stranger in our house and ask about my husband … my heart breaks for him ” she turned to her housekeeper eurynome and said “now bring us a chair and spread it soft with ﬂeece so our guest can sit and tell me his whole story and hear me out as well i’d like to ask him questions point by point” eurynome bustled off to fetch a polished chair and set it down and spread it soft with ﬂeece here odysseus sat the man of many trials as cautious penelope began the conversation “stranger let me start our questioning myself … who are you where are you from your city your parents” “my good woman” odysseus master of craft replied “no man on the face of the earth could ﬁnd fault with you yo u r f a m e b e l i e v e m e h a s r e a c h e d t h e v a u l t i n g s k i e s fame like a ﬂawless king’s who dreads the gods who governs a kingdom vast proud and strong— who upholds justice true and the black earth bears wheat and barley trees bow down with fruit and the sheep drop lambs and never fail and the sea teems with ﬁsh—thanks to his decent upright rule and under his sovereign sway the people ﬂourish so then here in your house ask me anything else but don’t please search out my birth my land or you’ll ﬁll my heart to overﬂowing even more as i bring back the past … i am a man who’s had his share of sorrows it’s wrong for me in someone else’s house to sit here moaning and groaning sobbing so— it makes things worse this grieving on and on one of your maids or you yourself might scold me think it’s just the wine that had doused my wits and made me drown in tears” “no no stranger” wise penelope demurred “whatever form and feature i had what praise i’d won the deathless gods destroyed that day the achaeans sailed away to troy my husband in their ships odysseus—if he could return to tend my life the renown i had would only grow in glory now my life is torment … look at the griefs some god has loosed against me all the nobles who rule the islands round about dulichion same and wooded zacynthus too and all who lord it in sunny ithaca itself— they court me against my will they lay waste my house so i pay no heed to strangers suppliants at my door not even heralds out on their public errands here— i yearn for odysseus always my heart pines away they rush the marriage on and i spin out my wiles a god from the blue it was inspired me ﬁrst to set up a great loom in our royal halls and i began to weave and the weaving ﬁnespun the yarns endless and i would lead them on ‘y oung men my suitors now that king odysseus is no more go slowly keen as you are to marry me until i can ﬁnish off this web … so my weaving won’t all fray and come to nothing this is a shroud for old lord laertes for that day when the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down i dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me yes if a man of such wealth should lie in state without a shroud for cover’ my very words and despite their pride and passion they believed me so by day i’d weave at my great and growing web— by night by the light of torches set beside me i would unravel all i’d done three whole years i deceived them blind seduced them with this scheme then when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on and the months waned and the long days came round once more then thanks to my maids—the shameless reckless creatures— the suitors caught me in the act denounced me harshly so i ﬁnished it off against my will they forced me and now i cannot escape a marriage nor can i contrive a deft way out my parents urge me to tie the knot and my son is galled as they squander his estate— he sees it all he’s a grown man by now equipped to tend to his own royal house and tend it well zeus grants my son that honor … but for all that—now tell me who you are where do you come from y ou’ve hardly sprung from a rock or oak like some old man of legend” the master improviser answered slowly “my lady … wife of la ertes’ son odysseus will your questions about my family never end all right then here’s my story even though it plunges me into deeper grief than i feel now but that’s the way of the world when one has been so far from home so long away as i roving over many cities of men enduring many hardships still my story will tell you all you need to know there is a land called crete … ringed by the winedark sea with rolling whitecaps— handsome country fertile thronged with people well past counting—boasting ninety cities language mixing with language sidebyside first come the achaeans then the native cretans hardy gallant in action then cydonian clansmen dorians living in three tribes and proud pelasgians last central to all their cities is magniﬁcent cnossos the site where minos ruled and each ninth year conferred with almighty zeus himself minos father of my father deucalion that bold heart besides myself deucalion sired prince idomeneus who set sail for troy in his beaked ships of war escorting atreus’ sons my own name is aethon i am the youngerborn my older brother’s a better man than i am now it was there in cnossos that i saw him … odysseus—and we traded gifts of friendship a heavy gale had landed him on our coast driven him way off course rounding malea’s cape when he was bound for troy he anchored in amnisus hard by the goddess’ cave of childbirth and labor that rough harbor—barely riding out the storm he came into town at once asking for idomeneus claiming to be my brother’s close respected friend too late ten or eleven days had already passed since he set sail for troy in his beaked ships so i took odysseus back to my own house gave him a hero’s welcome treated him in style— stores in our palace made for princely entertainment as for his comrades all who’d shipped with him i dipped into public stock to give them barley ruddy wine and ﬁne cattle for slaughter beef to their hearts’ content a dozen days they stayed with me there those brave achaeans penned up by a north wind so stiff that a man even on dry land could never keep his feet— some angry spirit raised that blast i’d say then on the thirteenth day the wind died down and they set sail for troy” falsehoods all but he gave his falsehoods all the ring of truth as she listened on her tears ﬂowed and soaked her cheeks as the heavy snow melts down from the high mountain ridges snow the west wind piles there and the warm east wind thaws and the snow melting swells the rivers to overﬂow their banks— so she dissolved in tears streaming down her lovely cheeks weeping for him her husband sitting there beside her odysseus’ heart went out to his griefstricken wife but under his lids his eyes remained stockstill— they might have been horn or iron— his guile fought back his tears and she once she’d had her ﬁll of grief and weeping turned again to her guest with this reply “now stranger i think i’ll test you just to see if there in your house with all his friendsinarms you actually entertained my husband as you say come tell me what sort of clothing he wore what cut of man was he what of the men who followed in his train” “a h g o o d w o m a n ” odysseus the great master of subtlety returned “how hard it is to speak after so much time apart … why some twenty years have passed since he left my house and put my land behind him even so imagine the man as i portray him— i can see him now king odysseus … he was wearing a heavy woolen cape seapurple in double folds with a golden brooch to clasp it twin sheaths for the pins on the face a work of art a hound clenching a dappled fawn in its front paws slashing it as it writhed all marveled to see it solid gold as it was the hound slashing throttling the fawn in its deaththroes hoofs ﬂailing to break free i noticed his glossy tunic too clinging to his skin like the thin glistening skin of a dried onion silky soft the glint of the sun itself women galore would gaze on it with relish and this too bear it in mind won’t you i’ve no idea if odysseus wore these things at home or a comrade gave him them as he boarded ship or a host perhaps—the man was loved by many there were few achaeans to equal him … and i i gave him a bronze sword myself a lined cloak elegant deep red and a fringed shirt as well and i saw him off in his long benched ship of war in lordly style something else he kept a herald beside him a man a little older than himself i’ll try to describe him to you best i can roundshouldered he was swarthy curlyhaired his name eurybates and odysseus prized him most of all his men their minds worked as one” his words renewed her deep desire to weep recognizing the strong clear signs odysseus offered but as soon as she’d had her ﬁll of tears and grief penelope turned again to her guest and said “now stranger much as i pitied you before now in my house you’ll be my special friend my honored guest i am the one myself who gave him the very clothes that you describe i brought them up from the storeroom folded them nea fastened the golden brooch to adorn my husband odysseus—never again will i embrace him striding home to his own native land a black day it was when he took ship to see that cursed city … destroy i call it—i hate to say its name” “a h m y q u e e n ” t h e m a n o f c r a f t a s s u r e d h e r “noble wife of laertes’ son odysseus ravage no more your lovely face with tears or consume your heart with grieving for your husband not that i’d blame you ever any woman will mourn the bridegroom she has lost lain with in love and borne his children too even though he was no odysseus—a man like a god they say but dry your tears and take my words to heart i will tell you the whole truth and hide nothing i have heard odysseus now at last is on his way he’s just in reach in rich thesprotian country— the man is still alive and he’s bringing home a royal hoard of treasure gifts he won from the people of those parts his crew he’s lost his crew and hollow ship on the winedark waters off thrinacia island zeus and helios raged dead set against odysseus for his menatarms had killed the cattle of the sun so down to the last hand they drowned in crashing seas but not odysseus clinging tight to his ship’s keel— the breakers ﬂung him out onto dry land on scheria the land of phaeacians close kin to the gods themselves and with all their hearts they prized him like a god showered the man with gifts and they’d have gladly sailed him home unscathed in fact odysseus would have been here beside you long ago but he thought it the better shrewder course to recoup his fortunes roving through the world at sly proﬁtturning there’s not a man alive to touch odysseus he’s got no rival there so i learned from phidon king of thesprotia who swore to me as he poured libations in his house ‘the ship’s hauled down and the shipmates set to sail to take odysseus home to native land’ but i … he shipped me off before a thesprotian cutter chanced to be heading for dulichion rich in wheat but he showed me all the treasure odysseus had amassed enough to last a man and ten generations of his heirs— so great the wealth stored up for him in the king’s vaults but odysseus he made clear was off at dodona then to hear the will of zeus that rustles forth from the god’s tall leafy oak how should he return after all the years away to his own beloved ithaca openly or in secret and so the man is safe as you can see and he’s coming home soon he’s close close at hand— he won’t be severed long from kin and country no not now i give you my solemn binding oath i swear by zeus the ﬁrst the greatest god— by odysseus’ hearth where i have come for help all will come to pass i swear exactly as i say true this very month—just as the old moon dies and the new moon rises into life—odysseus will return” “if only my friend” reserved penelope exclaimed “everything you say would come to pass yo u ’ d s o o n k n o w m y a f f e c t i o n k n o w m y g i f t s any man you meet would call you blest but my heart can sense the way it all will go odysseus i tell you is never coming back nor will you ever gain your passage home for we have no masters in our house like him at welcoming in or sending off an honored guest odysseus there was a man or was he all a dream but come women wash the stranger and make his bed with bedding blankets and lustrous spreads to keep him warm till dawn comes up and takes her golden throne then tomorrow at daybreak bathe him well and rub him down with oil so he can sit beside telemachus in the hall enjoy his breakfast there and anyone who offends our guest beyond endurance— he defeats himself he’s doomed to failure here no matter how raucously he raves and blusters on for how can you know my friend if i surpass all women in thoughtfulness and shrewd good sense if i’d allow you to take your meals at hall so weatherbeaten clad in rags and tatters our lives are much too brief … if a man is cruel by nature cruel in action the mortal world will call down curses on his head while he is alive and all will mock his memory after death but then if a man is kind by nature kind in action his guests will carry his fame across the earth and people all will praise him from the heart” “wait my queen” the crafty man objected “noble wife of laertes’ son odysseus— blankets and glossy spreads they’re not my style not from the day i launched out in my longoared ship and the snowy peaks of crete went fading far astern i’ll lie as i’ve done through sleepless nights before many a night i’ve spent on rugged beds aﬁeld waiting for dawn to mount her lovely throne nor do i pine for any footbaths either of all the women who serve your household here not one will touch my feet unless perhaps there is some old retainer the soul of trust someone who’s borne as much as i have borne … i wouldn’t mind if she would touch my feet” “dear friend the discreet penelope replied “never has any man so thoughtful—of all the guests in my palace come from foreign parts—been as welcome as you … so sensible so apt is every word you say i have just such an old woman seasoned wise who carefully tended my unlucky husband reared him took him into her arms the day his mother bore him— frail as the woman is she’ll wash your feet up with you now my good old eurycleia come and wash your master’s … equal in years odysseus must have feet and hands like his by now— hardship can age a person overnight” at that name the old retainer buried her face in both hands burst into warm tears and wailed out in grief “oh my child how helpless i am to help you now how zeus despised you more than all other men godfearing man that you were … never did any mortal burn the old thunderer such rich thighbones—offer ings charred and choice— never as many as you did praying always to reach a ripe old age and raise a son to glory now you alone he’s robbed of your homecoming day just so the women must have mocked my king far away when he’d stopped at some ﬁne house— just as all these bitches stranger mock you here and because you shrink from their taunts their wicked barbs you will not let them wash you the work is mine— icarius’ daughter wise penelope bids me now and i am all too glad i will wash your feet both for my own dear queen and for yourself— your sorrows wring my heart … and why listen to me closely mark my words many a wayworn guest has landed here but never i swear has one so struck my eyes— your build your voice your feet—you’re like odysseus … to the life” “old woman” wily odysseus countered “that’s what they all say who’ve seen us both we bear a striking resemblance to each other as you have had the wit to say yourself” the old woman took up a burnished basin she used for washing feet and poured in bowls of fresh cold water before she stirred in hot odysseus sitting full in the ﬁrelight suddenly swerved round to the dark gripped by a quick misgiving— soon as she touched him she might spot the scar the truth would all come out bending closer she started to bathe her master … then in a ﬂash she knew the scar— that old wound made years ago by a boar’s white tusk when odysseus went to parnassus out to see autolycus and his sons the man was his mother’s noble father one who excelled the world at thievery that and subtle shifty oaths hermes gave him the gift overjoyed by the thighs of lambs and kids he burned in the god’s honor— hermes the ready partner in his crimes now autolycus once visited ithaca’s fertile land to ﬁnd his daughter’s son had just been born eurycleia set him down on the old man’s knees as he ﬁnished dinner urging him “ autolycus you must ﬁnd a name for your daughter’s darling son the baby comes as the answer to her prayers” “y ou my daughter and you my soninlaw” autolycus returned “give the boy the name i tell you now just as i have come from afar creating pain for many— men and women across the good green earth— so let his name be odysseus … the son of pain a name he’ll earn in full and when he has come of age and pays his visit to parnassus—the great estate of his mother’s line where all my treasures lie—i will give him enough to cheer his heart then speed him home to you” and so in time odysseus went to collect the splendid gifts autolycus and the sons of autolycus warmed him in with eager handclasps hearty words of welcome his mother’s mother amphithea hugged the boy and kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes autolycus told his wellbred sons to prepare a princely feast they followed orders gladly herded an ox inside at once ﬁve years old skinned it and split the carcass into quarters deftly cut it in pieces skewered these on spits roasted all to a turn and served the portions out so all day long till the sun went down they feasted consuming equal shares to their hearts’ content then when the sun had set and night came on they turned to bed and took the gift of sleep as soon as young dawn with her rosered ﬁngers shone once more they all moved out for the hunt hounds in the lead autolycus’ sons and prince odysseus in their ranks climbing parnassus’ ridges thick with timber” they quickly reached the mountain’s windy folds and just as the sun began to strike the plowlands rising out of the deep calm ﬂow of the ocean river the beaters came to a wooded glen the hounds broke hot on a trail and right behind the pack they came autolycus’ sons—odysseus out in front now pressing the dogs bran dishing high his spear with its long shadow waving then and there a great boar lay in wait in a thicket lair so dense that the sodden gusty winds could never pierce it nor could the sun’s sharp rays invade its depths nor a downpour drench it through and through so dense so dark and piled with fallen leaves here as the hunters closed in for the kill crowding the hounds the tramp of men and dogs came drumming round the boar—he crashed from his lair his razor back bristling his eyes ﬂashing ﬁre and charging up to the hunt he stopped at bay— and odysseus rushed him ﬁrst shaking his long spear in a sturdy hand wild to strike but the boar struck faster lunging in on the slant a tusk thrusting up over the boy’s knee gouging a deep strip of ﬂesh but it never hit the bone— odysseus thrust and struck stabbing the beast’s right shoulder— a glint of bronze— the point ripped clean through and down in the dust he dropped grunting out his breath as his life winged away the sons of autolycus working over odysseus skillfully binding up his open wound— the gallant godlike prince— chanted an old spell that stanched the blood and quickly bore him home to their father’s palace there in no time autolycus and the sons of autolycus healed him well and showering him with splendid gifts sped odysseus back to his native land to ithaca a young man ﬁlled with joy his happy parents his father and noble mother welcomed him home and asked him of all his exploits blowbyblow how did he get that wound he told his tale with style how the white tusk of a wild boar had gashed his leg hunting on parnassus with autolycus and his sons … that scar— as the old nurse cradled his leg and her hands passed down she felt it knew it suddenly let his foot fall— down it dropped in the basin—the bronze clanged tipping over spilling water across the ﬂoor joy and torment gripped her heart at once tears rushed to her eyes—voice choked in her throat she reached for odysseus’ chin and whispered quickly “y es yes you are odysseus —oh dear boy— i couldn’t know you before … not till i touched the body of my king” she glanced at penelope keen to signal her that here was her own dear husband here and now but she could not catch the glance she took no heed athena turned her attention elsewhere but odysseus— his right hand shot out cl utching the nurse’s throat with his left he hugged her to himself and muttered “nurse you want to kill me y ou suckled me yourself at your own breast—and now i’m home at last after bearing twenty years of brutal hardship home on native ground but now you know now that a god has ﬂashed it in your mind quiet not a word to anyone in the house or else i warn you—and i mean business too— if a god beats down these brazen suitors at my hands i will not spare you— my old nurse that you are— when i kill the other women in my house” “child” shrewd old eurycleia protested “what nonsense you let slip through your teeth yo u k n o w me—i’m stubborn never give an inch— i’ll keep still as solid rock or iron one more thing take it to heart i tell you if a god beats down these brazen suitors at your hands i’ll report in full on the women in your house who are disloyal to you who are guiltless” “nurse” the cool tactician odysseus said “why bother to count them off a waste of breath i’ll observe them judge each one myself just be quiet keep your tales to yourself leave the rest to the gods” hushed so the old nurse went padding along the halls to fetch more water—her basin had all spilled— and once she’d bathed and rubbed him down with oil odysseus drew his chair up near the ﬁre again trying to keep warm but he hid his scar beneath his beggar’s rags as cautious penelope resumed their conversation “my friend i have only one more question for you something slight now the hour draws on for welcome sleep— for those who can yield to sweet repose that is heartsick as they are as for myself though some god has sent me pain that knows no bounds all day long i indulge myself in sighs and tears as i see to my tasks direct the household women when night foils and the world lies lost in sleep i take to my bed my heart throbbing about to break anxieties swarming piercing—i may go mad with grief like pandareus’ daughter the nightingale in the green woods lifting her lovely song at th e ﬁrst warm rush of spring perched in the treetops’ rustling leaves and pouring forth her music shifting trilling and sinking rippling high to burst in grief for itylus her beloved boy king zethus’ son whom she in innocence once cut down with bronze … so my wavering heart goes shuttling back and forth do i stay beside my son and keep all things secure— my lands my servingwomen the grand highroofed house— true to my husband’s bed the people’s voice as well or do i follow at last the best man who courts me here in the halls who gives the greatest gifts my son—when he was a boy and lighthearted— urged me not to marry and leave my husband’s house but now he has grown and reached his young prime he begs me to leave our palace travel home telemachus so obsessed with his own estate the wealth my princely suitors bleed away but please read this dream for me won’t you listen closely … i keep twenty geese in the house from the water trough they come and peck their wheat—i love to watch them all but down from a mountain swooped this great hookbeaked eagle yes and he snapped their necks and killed them one and all and they lay in heaps throughout the halls while he back to the clear blue sky he soared at once but i wept and wailed—only a dream of course— and our wellgroomed ladies came and clustered round me sobbing stricken the eagle killed my geese but down he swooped again and settling onto a jutting rafter called out in a human voice that dried my tears ‘courage daughter of famous king icarius this is no dream but a happy waking vision real as day that will come true for you the geese were your suitors—i was once the eagle but now i am your husband back again at last about to launch a terrible fate against them all’ so he vowed and the soothing sleep released me i peered around and saw my geese in the house pecking at their wheat at the same trough where they always took their meal” “dear woman” quick odysseus answered “twist it however you like your dream can only mean one thing odysseus told you himself—he’ll make it come to pass destruction is clear for each and every suitor not a soul escapes his death and doom” “a h m y f r i e n d ” s e a s o n e d p e n e l o p e d i s s e n t e d “dreams are hard to unravel wayward drifting things— not all we glimpse in them will come to pass … two gates there are for our evanescent dreams one is made of ivory the other made of horn those that pass through the ivory cleanly carved are willo’thewisps their message bears no fruit the dreams that pass through the gates of polished horn are fraught with truth for the dreamer who can see them but i can’t believe my strange dream has come that way much as my son and i would love to have it so one more thing i’ll tell you—weigh it well the day that dawns today this cursed day will cut me off from odysseus’ house now i mean to announce a contest with those axes the ones he would often line up here inside the hall twelve in a straight unbroken row like blocks to shore a keel then stand well back and whip an arrow through the lot now i will bring them on as a trial for my suitors the hand that can string the bow with greatest ease that shoots an arrow clean through all twelve axes— he’s the man i follow yes forsaking this house where i was once a bride this gracious house so ﬁlled with the best that life can offer— i shall always remember it that i know … even in my dreams” “oh my queen” odysseus man of exploits urged her on “royal wife of laertes’ son odysseus now don’t put off this test in the halls a moment before that crew can handle the polished bow string it taut and shoot through all those axes— odysseus man of exploits will be home with you” “if only my friend” the wise penelope replied “you were willing to sit beside me in the house indulging me in the comfort of your presence sleep would never drift across my eyes but one can’t go without his sleep forever the immortals give each thing its proper place in our mortal lives throughout the good green earth so now i’m going back to my room upstairs and lie down on my bed that bed of pain my tears have streaked year in year out from the day odysseus sailed away to see … destroy i call it—i hate to say its name there i’ll rest while you lie here in the hall spreading your blankets somewhere on the ﬂoor or the women will prepare a decent bed” with that the queen went up to her lofty welllit room and not alone her women followed close behind penelope once they reached the upper story fell to weeping for odysseus her beloved husband till watchful athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep book xx portents gather off in the entrancehall the great king made his bed spreading out on the ground the raw hide of an ox heaping over it ﬂeece from sheep the suitors butchered day and night then eurynome threw a blanket over him once he’d nestled down and there odysseus lay … plotting within himself the suitors’ death— awake alert as the women slipped from the house the maids who whored in the suitors’ beds each night tittering linking arms and frisking as before the master’s anger rose inside his chest torn in thought debating head and heart— should he up and rush them kill them one and all or let them rut with their lovers one last time the heart inside him growled low with rage as a bitch mounting over her weak defenseless puppies growls facing a stranger bristling for a showdown— so he growled from his depths hackles rising at their outrage but he struck his chest and curbed his ﬁghting heart “bear up old heart y ou’ve borne worse far worse that day when the cyclops manmountain bolted your hardy comrades down but you held fast— nobody but your cunning pulled you through the monster’s cave you thought would be your death” so he forced his spirit into submission the rage in his breast reined back—unswerving all endurance but he himself kept tossing turning intent as a cook before some whitehot blazing ﬁre who rolls his sizzling sausage back and forth packed with fat and blood—keen to broil it quickly tossing turning it this way that way—so he cast about how could he get these shameless suitors in his clutches one man facing a mob … when close to his side she came athena sweeping down from the sky in a woman’s build and hovering at his head the goddess spoke “why still awake the unluckiest man alive here is your house your wife at home your son as ﬁne a boy as one could hope to have” “true” the wily ﬁghter replied “how right you are goddess but still this worry haunts me heart and soul— how can i get these shameless suitors in my clutches singlehanded braving an army always camped inside there’s another worry that haunts me even more what if i kill them—thanks to you and zeus— how do i run from under their avengers show me the way i ask you” “impossible man” athena bantered the goddess’ eyes ablaze “others are quick to trust a weaker comrade some poor mortal far less cunning than i but i am a goddess look the very one who guards you in all your trials to the last i tell you this straight out even if ﬁfty bands of mortal ﬁghters closed around us hot to kill us off in battle still you could drive away their herds and sleek ﬂocks so surrender to sleep at last what a misery keeping watch through the night wide awake— you’ll soon come up from under all your troubles” with that she showered sleep across his eyes and back to olympus went the lustrous goddess as soon as sleep came on him loosing his limbs slipping the toils of anguish from his mind his devoted wife awoke and sitting up in her soft bed returned to tears when the queen had wept to her heart’s content she prayed to the huntress artemis ﬁrst of all “a r t e m i s — g o d d e s s n o b l e d a u g h t e r o f z e u s i f o n l y you’d whip an arrow through my breast and tear my life out now at once or let some whirlwind pluck me up and sweep me away along those murky paths and ﬂing me down where the ocean river running round the world rolls back upon itself quick as the whirlwinds swept away pandareus’ daughters— years ago when the gods destroyed their parents leaving the young girls orphans in their house but radiant aphrodite nursed them well on cheese and luscious honey and heady wine and hera gave them beauty and sound good sense more than all other women—virgin artemis made them tall and athena honed their skills to fashion lovely work but then when aphrodite approached olympus’ peaks to ask for the girls their crowning day as brides from zeus who loves the lightning—zeus who knows all all that’s fated all not fated for mortal man— then the storm spirits snatched them away and passed them on to the hateful furies yes for all their loving care just so may the gods who rule olympus blot me out artemis with your glossy braids come shoot me dead— so i can plunge beneath this loathsome earth with the image of odysseus vivid in my mind never let me warm the heart of a weaker man even grief is bearable true when someone weeps through the days sobbing heart convulsed with pain yet embraced by sleep all night—sweet oblivion sleep dissolving all the good and the bad once it seals our eyes— but even my dreams torment me sent by wicked spirits again—just this night—someone lay beside me … like odysseus to the life when he embarked with his menatarms my heart raced with joy no dream i thought the waking truth at last” at those words dawn rose on her golden throne in a sudden gleam of light and great odysseus caught the sound of his wife’s cry and began to daydream—deep in his heart it seemed she stood beside him knew him now at last … gathering up the ﬂeece and blankets where he’d slept he laid them on a chair in the hall he took the oxhide out and spread it down lifted his hands and prayed to zeus “father zeus if you really willed it so—to bring me home over land and sealanes home to native ground after all the pain you brought me—show me a sign a good omen voiced by someone awake indoors another sign outside from zeus himself” and zeus in all his wisdom heard that prayer he thundered at once out of his clear blue heavens high above the clouds and odysseus’ spirit lifted then from within the halls a woman grinding grain let ﬂy a lucky word close at hand she was where the good commander set the handmills once and now twelve women in all performed their tasks grinding the wheat and barley marrow of men’s bones the rest were abed by now—they’d milled their stint— this one alone the frailest of all kept working on stopping her mill she spoke an omen for her master “zeus father king of gods and men now there was a crack of thunder out of the starry sky— and not a cloud in sight sure it’s a sign you’re showing someone now so poor as i am grant me my prayer as well let this day be the last the last these suitors bolt their groaning feasts in king odysseus’ house these brutes who break my knees—heartwrenching labor grinding their grain—now let them eat their last” a lucky omen linked with zeus’s thunder odysseus’ heart leapt up the man convinced he’d grind the scoundrels’ lives out in revenge by now the other maids were gathering in odysseus’ royal palace raking up on the hearth the ﬁre still going strong telemachus climbed from bed and dressed at once brisk as a young god— over his shoulder he slung his wellhoned sword he fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet he seized his tough spear tipped with a bronze point and took his stand at the threshold calling eurycleia “dear nurse how did you treat the stranger in our house with bed and board or leave him to lie untended that would be mother’s way—sensible as she is— all impulse doting over some worthless stranger turning a good man out to face the worst” “please child” his calm old nurse replied “don’t blame her —your mother’s blameless this time he sat and drank his wine till he’d had his ﬁll food he’d lost his hunger but she asked him and when it was time to think of turning in she told the maids to spread a decent bed but he— so downandout poor soul so dogged by fate— said no to snuggling into a bed between covers no sir the man lay down in the entrancehall on the raw hide of an ox and sheep’s ﬂeece and we threw a blanket over him so we did” hearing that telemachus strode out through the palace spear in hand and a pair of sleek hounds went trotting at his heels he made for the meeting grounds to join the island lords while eurycleia the daughter of ops pisenor’s son that best of women gave the maids their orders “quick now look alive sweep out the house wet down the ﬂoors yo u t h o s e p u r p l e c o v e r l e t s ﬂing them over the fancy chairs all those tables sponge them down—scour the winebowls burnished cups the rest—now off you go to the spring and fetch some water fast as your legs can run our young gallants won’t be long from the palace they’ll be bright and early—today’s a public feast” they hung on her words and ran to do her bidding full twenty scurried off to the spring’s dark water others bent to the hous ework all good hands then in they trooped the strutting servingmen who split the ﬁrewood cleanly now as the women bustled in from the spring the swineherd at their heels driving three fat porkers the best of all his herds and leaving them to root in the broad courtyard up he went to odysseus hailed him warmly “friend do the suitors show you more respect or treat you like the dregs of the earth as always” “good eumaeus” the crafty man replied “if only the gods would pay back their outrage wild and reckless young cubs conniving here in another’s house they’ve got no sense of shame” and now as the two conﬁded in each other the goatherd melanthius sauntered toward them herding his goats with a pair of drovers’ help the pick of his ﬂocks to make the suitors’ meal under the echoing porch he tethered these then turned on odysseus once again with cutting insults “still alive still hounding your betters begging round the house why don’t you cart yourself away get out we’ll never part i swear till we taste each other’s ﬁsts riffraff you and your begging make us sick get out— we’re hardly the only banquet on the island” no reply the wily one just shook his head silent his mind churning with thoughts of bloody work … third to arrive was philoetius that good cowherd prodding in for the crowd a heifer and fat goats boatmen had brought them over from the mainland crews who ferry across all travelers too whoever comes for passage under the echoing porch he tethered all heads well and then approached the swineherd full of questions “who’s this stranger eumaeus just come to the house what roots does the man claim—who are his people where are his blood kin his father’s ﬁelds poor beggar but what a build—a royal king’s ah once the gods weave trouble into our lives they drive us across the earth they drown us all in pain even kings of the realm” and with that thought he walked up to odysseus gave him his right hand and winged a greeting “cheers old friend old father here’s to your luck great days from this day on— saddled now as you are wi th so much trouble father zeus no god’s more deadly than you no mercy for men you give them life yourself then plunge them into misery brutal hardship i broke into sweat my friend when i ﬁrst saw you— see my eyes still brim with tears remembering him odysseus … he must wear such rags i know it knocking about drifting through the world if he’s still alive and sees the light of day if he’s dead already lost in the house of death my heart aches for odysseus my great lord and master he set me in charge of his herds in cephallenian country when i was just a youngster how they’ve grown by now past counting no mortal on earth could breed a ﬁner stock of oxen—broad in the brow they thrive like ears of corn but just look these interlopers tell me to drive them in for their own private feasts not a thought for the young prince in the house they never ﬂinch— no regard for the gods’ wrath—in their mad rush to carve up his goods my master gone so long i’m tossed from horn to horn in my own mind … what a traitor i’d be with the prince alive if i’d run off to some other country herds and all to a new set of strangers ah but isn’t it worse to hold out here tending the herds for upstarts not their owners—suffering all the pains of hell i could have ﬂed ages ago to some great king who’d give me shelter it’s unbearable here true but i still dream of my old master unlucky man—if only he’d drop in from the blue and drive these suitors all in a rout throughout the halls” “cowherd” the cool tactician odysseus answered “you’re no coward and nobody’s fool i’d say even i can see there’s sense in that old head so i tell you this on my solemn binding oath i swear by zeus the ﬁrst of all the gods— by the table of hospitality waiting for us by odysseus’ hearth where i have come for help odysseus will come home while you’re still here yo u ’ l l s e e w i t h y o u r o w n e y e s i f y o u h a v e t h e h e a r t these suitors who lord it here cut down in blood” “stranger if only” the cowherd cried aloud “if only zeus would make that oath come true— you’d see my power my ﬁghting arms in action” eumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods that their wise king would soon come home again now as they spoke and urged each other on and once more the suitors were plotting certain doom for the young prince—suddenly banking high on the left an omen ﬂew past an eagle clutching a trembling dove and amphinomus rose in haste to warn them all “my friends we’ll never carry off this plot to kill the prince let’s concentrate on feasting” his timely invitation pleased them all the suitors ambled into odysseus’ royal house and ﬂinging down their cloaks on a chair or bench they butchered hulking sheep and fatted goats fullgrown hogs and a young cow from the herd they roasted all the innards served them round and ﬁlled the bowls with wine and mixed it well eumaeus passed out cups philoetius trusty herdsman brought on loaves of bread in ample wicker trays melanthius poured the wine the whole company reached out for the good things that lay at hand telemachus maneuvering shrewdly sat his father down on the stone threshold just inside the timbered hall and set a rickety stool and cramped table there he gave him a share of innards poured his wine in a golden cup and added a bracing invitation “now sit right there drink your wine with the crowd i’ll defend you from all their taunts and blows these young bucks this is no public place this is odysseus’ house— my father won it for me so it’s mine yo u s u i t o r s c o n t r o l y o u r s e l v e s n o i n s u l t s n o w no brawling no or it’s war between us all” so he declared and they all bit their lips amazed the prince could speak with so much daring only eupithes’ son antinous ventured “fighting words but do let’s knuckle under— to our prince such abuse such naked threats but clearly zeus has foiled us or long before we would have shut his mouth for him in the halls ﬂuent and ﬂowing as he is” so he mocked telemachus paid no heed and now through the streets the heralds passed leading the beasts marked out for sacriﬁce on apollo’s grand festal day and the islanders with their long hair were ﬁling into the god’s shady grove—the distant deadly archer those in the palace once they’d roasted the prime cuts pulled them off the spits and sharing out the portions fell to the royal feast … the men who served them gave odysseus his share fair as the helping they received themselves so telemachus ordered the king’s own son but athena had no mind to let the brazen suitors hold back now from their heartrending insults— she meant to make the anguish cut still deeper into the core of laertes’ son odysseus there was one among them a lawless boor— ctesippus was his name he made his home in same a fellow so impressed with his own astounding wealth he courted the wife of odysseus gone for years now the man harangued his swaggering comrades “listen to me my ﬁne friends here’s what i say from the start our guest has had his fair share— it’s only right you know how impolite it would be how wrong to scant whatever guest telemachus welcomes to his house look here i’ll give him a proper guestgift too a prize he can hand the crone who bathes his feet or a tip for another slave who haunts the halls of our great king odysseus” on that note grabbing an oxhoof out of a basket where it lay with a brawny hand he ﬂung it straight at the king— but odysseus ducked his head a little dodging the blow and seething just as the oxhoof hit the solid wall he clenched his teeth in a wry sardonic grin telemachus dressed ctesippus down at once “ctesippus you can thank your lucky stars you missed our guest—he du cked your blow by god else i would have planted my sharp spear in your bowels— your father would have been busy with your funeral not your wedding here enough don’t let me see more offenses in my house not from anyone i’m alive to it all now the good and the bad—the boy you knew is gone but i still must bear with this this lovely sight … sheepﬂocks butchered wine swilled food squandered— how can a man ﬁght off so many singlehanded but no more of your crimes against me please unless you’re bent on cutting me down now and i’d rather die yes better that by far than have to look on at your outrage day by day guests treated to blows men dragging the servingwomen through our noble house exploi ting them all no shame” dead quiet the suitors all fell silent hushed at last damastor’s son agelaus rose and said “fair enough my friends when a man speaks well we have no grounds for wrangling no cause for abuse hands off this stranger or any other servant in king odysseus’ palace but now a word of friendly advice for telemachus and his mother— here’s hoping it proves congenial to them both so long as your hearts still kept a spark alive that odysseus would return —that great deep man— who could blame you playing the waiting game at home and holding off the suitors the better course it’s true what if odysseus had returned had made it home at last but now it’s clear as day—the man will come no more so go telemachus sit with your mother coax her to wed the best man here the one who offers most so you can have and hold your father’s estate eating and drinking here your mind at peace while mother plays the wife in another’s house” the young prince keeping his poise replied “i swear by zeus agelaus by all my father suffered— dead no doubt or wandering far from ithaca these days— i don’t delay my mother’s marriage not a moment i press her to wed the man who takes her heart i’ll shower her myself with boundless gifts but i shrink from driving mother from our house issuing harsh commands against her will god forbid it ever comes to that ” so he vowed and athena set off uncontrollable laughter in the suitors crazed them out of their minds—mad hysterical laughter seemed to break from the jaws of strangers not their own and the meat they were eating oozed red with blood— tears ﬂooded their eyes hearts possessed by grief the inspired seer theoclymenus wailed out in their midst “poor men what terror is this that overwhelms you so night shrouds your heads your faces down to your knees— cries of mourning are bursting into ﬁre—cheeks rivering tears— the walls and the handsome crossb eams dripping dank with blood ghosts look thronging the entrance thronging the court go trooping down to the realm of death and darkness the sun is blotted out of the sky—look there— a lethal mist spreads all across the earth” at that they all broke into peals of laughter aimed at the seer— polybus’ son eurymachus braying ﬁrst and foremost “our guest just in from abroad the man is raving quick my boys hustle him out of the house into the meeting grounds the light of day— everything here he thinks is dark as night” “eurymachus” the inspired prophet countered “when i want your escort i’ll ask for it myself i have eyes and ears and both my feet still and a head that’s fairly sound nothing to be ashamed of these will do to take me past those doors … oh i can see it now— the disaster closing on you all there’s no escaping it no way out—not for a single one of you suitors wild reckless fools plotting outrage here the halls of odysseus great and strong as a god” with that he marched out of the sturdy house and went home to piraeus the host who warmed him in now all the suitors trading their snide glances started heckling telemachus made a mockery of his guests one or another brash young gallant scoffed “telemachus no one’s more unlucky with his guests” “look what your man dragged in—this mangy tramp scraping for bread and wine” “not ﬁt for good hard work the bag of bones—” “a u s e l e s s d e a d w e i g h t o n t h e l a n d ” “a n d t h e n t h i s c h a r l a t a n u p a n d a p e s t h e p r o p h e t ” “take it from me—you’ll be better off by far— toss your friends in a slaveship—” “pack them off to sicily fast—they’ll fetch you one sweet price” so they jeered but the prince paid no attention … silent eyes riveted on his father always waiting the moment he’d lay hands on that outrageous mob and all the while icarius’ daughter wise penelope had placed her carved chair within earshot at the door so she could catch each word they uttered in the hall laughing rowdily men prepared their noonday meal succulent rich—they’d butchered quite a herd but as for supper what could be less enticing than what a goddess and a powerful man would spread before them soon a groaning feast— for they’d been ﬁrst to plot their vicious crimes book xxi odysseus strings his bow the time had come the goddess athena with her blazing eyes inspired penelope icarius’ daughter wary poised to set the bow and the gleaming iron axes out before her suitors waiting in odysseus’ hall— to test their skill and bring their slaughter on up the steep stairs to her room she climbed and grasped in a steady hand the curved key— ﬁne bronze with ivory haft attached— and then with her chamberwomen made her way to a hidden storeroom far in the palace depths and there they lay the royal master’s treasures bronze gold and a wealth of hard wrought iron and there it lay as well … his backsprung bow with its quiver bristling arrows shafts of pain gifts from the old days from a friend he’d met in lacedaemon—iphitus eurytus’ gallant son once in messene the two struck up together in sly ortilochus’ house that time odysseus went to collect a debt the whole realm owed him for messenian raiders had lifted ﬂocks from ithaca three hundred head in their oarswept ships the herdsmen too so his father and island elders sent odysseus off a young boy on a mission a distant embassy made to right that wrong iphitus went there hunting the stock that he had lost a dozen mares still nursing their hardy suckling mules the same mares that would prove his certain death when he reached the son of zeus that iron heart heracles—the past master of monstrous works— who killed the man a guest in his own house brutal not a care for the wrathful eyes of god or rites of hospitality he had spread before him no he dined him then he murdered him commandeered those hardhoofed mares for the hero’s own grange still on the trail of these when he met odysseus iphitus gave him the bow his father mighty eurytus used to wield as a young man but when he died in his lofty house he left it to his son in turn odysseus gave his friend a sharp sword and a rugged spear to mark the start of friendship treasured ties that bind but before they got to know the warmth of each other’s board the son of zeus had murdered iphitus eurytus’ magniﬁcent son who gave the prince the bow that great weapon— king odysseus never took it abroad with him when he sailed off to war in his long black ships he kept it stored away in his stately house guarding the memory of a cherished friend and only took that bow on hunts at home now the lustrous queen soon reached the hidden vault and stopped at the oaken doorsill work an expert sanded smooth and trued to the line some years ago planting the doorjambs snugly hanging shining doors at once she loosed the thong from around its hook inserted the key and aiming straight and true shot back the bolts—and the rasping doors groaned as loud as a bull will bellow champing grass at pasture so as the key went home those handsome double doors rang out now and sprang wide before her she stepped onto a plank where chests stood tall brimming with clothing scented sweet with cedar reaching tiptoe lifting the bow down off its peg still secure in the burnished case that held it down she sank laying the case across her knees and dissolved in tears with a high thin wail as she drew her husband’s weapon from its sheath … then having wept and sobbed to her heart’s content off she went to the hall to meet her proud admirers cradling her husband’s back sprung bow in her arms its quiver bristling arrows shafts of pain her women followed bringing a chest that held the bronze and the iron axes trophies won by the master that radiant woman once she reached her suitors drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side and delivered an ultimatum to her suitors “listen to me my overbearing friends y ou who plague this palace night and day drinking eating us out of house and home with the lord and master absent gone so long— the only excuse that you can offer is your zest to win me as your bride so to arms my gallants here is the prize at issue right before you look— i set before you the great bow of king odysseus now the hand that can string this bow with greatest ease that shoots an arrow clean through all twelve axes— he is the man i follow yes forsaking this house where i was once a bride this gracious house so ﬁlled with the best that life can offer— i shall always remember it that i know … even in my dreams” she turned to eumaeus ordered the good swineherd now to set the bow and the gleaming iron axes out before the suitors he broke into tears as he received them laid them down the cowherd wept too when he saw his master’s bow but antinous wheeled on both and let them have it “y okels fools—you can’t tell night from day yo u m a w k i s h i d i o t s w h y a r e y o u s n i v e l i n g h e r e yo u ’r e s t i r r i n g u p y o u r m i s t r e s s i s n’ t s h e d r o w n e d in grief already she’s lost her darling husband sit down eat in peace or take your snufﬂing out of doors but leave that bow right here— our crucial test that makes or breaks us all no easy game i wager to string his polished bow not a soul in the crowd can match odysseus— what a man he was … i saw him once remember him to this day though i was young and foolish way back then” smooth talk but deep in the suitor’s heart his hopes were bent on stringing the bow and shooting through the axes antinous—fated to be the ﬁrst man to taste an arrow whipped from great odysseus’ hands the king he mocked at ease in the king’s house egging comrades on to mock him too “a m a z i n g ” prince telemachus waded in with a laugh “zeus up there has robbed me of my wits my own dear mother sensible as she is says she’ll marry again forsake our house and look at me—laughing for all i’m worth giggling like some fool step up my friends here is the prize at issue right before you look— a woman who has no equal now in all achaean country neither in holy pylos nor in argos or mycenae not even ithaca itself or the loamy mainland yo u k n o w i t w e l l w h y s i n g m y m o t h e r ’s p r a i s e s come let the games begin no dodges no delays no turning back from the stringing of the bow— we’ll see who wins we will i’d even take a crack at the bow myself … if i string it and shoot through all the axes i’d worry less if my noble mother left our house with another man and left me here behind—man enough at last to win my father’s splendid prizes” with that he leapt to his feet and dropped his bright red cloak slipping the sword and swordbelt off his shoulders first he planted the axes digging a long trench one for all and trued them all to a line then tamped the earth to bed them wonder took the revelers looking on his work so ﬁrm precise though he’d never seen the axes ranged before he stood at the threshold poised to try the bow … three times he made it shudder straining to bend it three times his power ﬂagged—but his hopes ran high he’d string his father’s bow and shoot through every iron and now struggling with all his might for the fourth time he would have strung the bow but odysseus shook his head and stopped him short despite his tensing zeal “god help me” the inspired prince cried out “must i be a weakling a failure all my life unless i’m just too young to trust my hands to ﬁght off any man who rises up against me come my betters so much stronger than i am— try the bow and ﬁnish off the contest” he propped his father’s weapon on the ground tilting it up against the polished wellhung doors and resting a shaft aslant the bow’s ﬁne horn then back he went to the seat that he had left “up friends” antinous called taking over “one man after another left to right starting from where the steward pours the wine” so antinous urged and all agreed the ﬁrst man up was leodes oenops’ son a seer who could see their futures in the smoke who always sat by the glowing winebowl well back the one man in the group who loathed their reckless ways appalled by all their outrage his turn ﬁrst … picking up the weapon now and the swift arrow he stood at the threshold poised to try the bow but failed to bend it as soon as he tugged the string his hands went slack his soft uncallused hands and he called back to the suitors “friends i can’t bend it take it someone—try here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath all our best contenders still better be dead than live on here never winning the prize that tempts us all—forever in pursuit burning with expectation every day if there’s still a suitor here who hopes who aches to marry penelope odysseus’ wife just let him try the bow he’ll see the truth he’ll soon lay siege to another argive woman trailing her long robes and shower her with gifts— and then our queen can marry the one who offers most the man marked out by fate to be her husband” with those words he thrust the bow aside tilting it up against the polished wellhung doors and resting a shaft aslant the bow’s ﬁne horn then back he went to the seat that he had left but antinous turned on the seer abuses ﬂying “leodes what are you saying what’s got past your lips what awful grisly nonsense—it shocks me to hear it— ‘here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath’ just because you can’t string it you’re so weak clearly your genteel mother never bred her boy for the work of bending bows and shooting arrows we have champions in our ranks to string it quickly hop to it melanthius”—he barked at the goatherd— “rake the ﬁre in the hall pull up a big stool heap it with ﬂeece and fetch that hefty ball of lard from the stores inside so we young lords can heat and limber the bow and rub it down with grease before we try again and ﬁnish off the contest” the goatherd bustled about to rake the ﬁre still going strong he pulled up a big stool heaped it with ﬂeece and fetched the hefty ball of lard from the stores inside and the young men limbered the bow rubbing it down with hot grease then struggled to bend it back but failed no use— they fell far short of the strength the bow required antinous still held off dashing eurymachus too the ringleaders of all the suitors head and shoulders the strongest of the lot but now the king’s two men the cowherd and the swineherd had slipped out of the palace sidebyside and great odysseus left the house to join them once they were past the courtyard and the gates he probed them deftly surely “cowherd swineherd what shall i blurt this out or keep it to myself no speak out the heart inside me says so how far would you go to ﬁght beside odysseus say he dropped like that from a clear blue sky and a god brought him back— would you ﬁght for the suitors or your king tell me how you feel inside your hearts” “father zeus” the trusty cowherd shouted “bring my prayer to pass let the master come— some god guide him now y ou’d see my power my ﬁghting arms in action” eumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods that their wise king would soon come home again certain at least these two were loyal to the death odysseus reassured them quickly “i’m right here here in the ﬂesh—myself —and home at last after bearing twenty years of brutal hardship now i know that of all my men you two alone longed for my return from the rest i’ve heard not one real prayer that i come back again so now i’ll tell you what’s in store for you if a god beats down the lofty suitors at my hands i’ll ﬁnd you wives both of you grant you property sturdy houses beside my own and in my eyes you’ll be comrades to prince telemachus brothers from then on come i’ll show you something—living proof— know me for certain put your minds at rest this scar look where a boar’s white tusk gored me years ago hunting on parnassus autolycus’ sons and i” with that pushing back his rags he revealed the great scar … and the men gazed at it scanned it knew it well broke into tears and threw their arms around their master— lost in affection kissing his head and shoulders and so odysseus kissed their heads and hands now the sun would have set upon their tears if odysseus had not called a halt himself “no more weeping coming out of the house a man might see us tell the men inside let’s slip back in—singly not in a pack i’ll go ﬁrst y ou’re next here’s our signal when all the rest in there our lordly friends are dead against my having the bow and quiver good eumaeus carry the weapon down the hall and put it in my hands then tell the servingwomen to lock the snugly ﬁtted doors to their own rooms if anyone hears from there the jolting blows and groans of men caught in our huge net not one of them show her face— sit tight keep to her weaving not a sound yo u m y g o o d p h i l o e t i u s h e r e a r e y o u r o r d e r s shoot the bolt of the courtyard’s outer gate lock it lash it fast” with that command the master entered his wellconstructed house and back he went to the stool that he had left the king’s two men in turn slipped in as well just now eurymachus held the bow in his hands turning it over tip to tip before the blazing ﬁre to heat the weapon but he failed to bend it even so and the suitor’s high heart groaned to bursting “a b l a c k d a y ” h e e x c l a i m e d i n w o u n d e d p r i d e “a blow to myself a blow to each man here it’s less the marriage that mortiﬁes me now— that’s galling too but lots of women are left some in seagirt ithaca some in other cities what breaks my heart is the fact we fall so short of great odysseus’ strength we cannot string his bow a disgrace to ring in the ears of men to come” “eurymachus” eupithes’ son antinous countered “it will never come to that as you well know today is a feastday up and down the island in honor of the archer god who ﬂexes bows today set it aside rest easy now and all the axes let’s just leave them planted where they are trust me no one’s about to crash the gates of laertes’ son and carry off these trophies steward pour some drops for the god in every cup we’ll tip the wine then put the bow to bed and ﬁrst thing in the morning have melanthius bring the pick of his goats from all his herds so we can burn the thighs to apollo god of archers— then try the bow and ﬁnish off the contest” welcome advice and again they all agreed heralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine they tipped ﬁrst drops for the god in every cup then poured full rounds for all and now once they’d tipped libations out and drunk their ﬁll the king of craft odysseus said with all his cunning “listen to me you lords who court the noble queen i have to say what the heart inside me urges i appeal especially to eurymachus and you brilliant antinous who spoke so shrewdly now give the bow a rest for today leave it to the gods— at dawn the archer god will grant a victory to the man he favors most for the moment give me the polished bow now won’t you so to amuse you all i can tr y my hand my strength … is the old force still alive inside these gnarled limbs or has a life of roaming years of rough neglect destroyed it long ago” modest words that sent them all into hot indignant rage fearing he just might string the polished bow so antinous rounded on him dressed him down “not a shred of sense in your head you ﬁlthy drifter not content to feast at your ease with us the island’s pride never denied your full share of the banquet never you can listen in on our secrets no one else can eavesdrop on our talk no tramp no beggar the wine has overpowered you heady wine— the ruin of many another man whoever gulps it down and drinks beyond his limit wine—it drove the centaur famous eurytion mad in the halls of lionhearted pirithous there to visit the lapiths crazed with wine the headlong centaur bent to his ugly work in the prince’s own house his hosts sprang up seized with fury dragged him across the forecourt ﬂung him out of doors hacking his nose and ears off with their knives no mercy the creature reeled away still blind with drink his heart like a wild storm loaded with all the frenzy in his mind and so the feud between mortal men and centaurs had its start but the drunk was ﬁrst to bring disaster on himself by drowning in his cups y ou too i promise you no end of trouble if you should string that bow yo u ’ l l m e e t n o k i n d n e s s i n o u r p a r t o f t h e w o r l d — we’ll sail you off in a black ship to echetus the mainland king who wrecks all men alive nothing can save you from his royal grip so drink but hold your peace don’t take on the younger stronger men” “a n t i n o u s ” w a t c h f u l p e n e l o p e s t e p p e d i n “how impolite it would be how wrong to scant whatever guest telemachus welcomes to his house y ou really think—if the stranger trusts so to his hands and strength that he strings odysseus’ great bow— he’ll take me home and claim me as his bride he never dreamed of such a thing i’m sure don’t let that ruin the feast for any reveler here unthinkable—nothing nothing could be worse” polybus’ son eurymachus had an answer “wise penelope daughter of icarius do we really expect the man to wed you unthinkable i know but we do recoil at the talk of men and women one of the island’s meaner sort will mutter ‘look at the riffraff courting a king’s wife weaklings look they can’t even string his bow but along came this beggar drifting out of the blue— strung his bow with ease and shot through all the axes’ gossip will ﬂy we’ll hang our heads in shame” “shame ” alert penelope protested— “how can you hope for any public fame at all yo u w h o d i s g r a c e d e v o u r a g r e a t m a n’s h o u s e a n d h o m e why hang your heads in shame over next to nothing our friend here is a strapping wellbuilt man and claims to be the son of a noble father come hand him the bow now let’s just see … i tell you this—and i’ll make good my word— if he strings the bow and apollo grants him glory i’ll dress him in shirt and cloak in handsome clothes i’ll give him a good sharp lance to ﬁght off men and dogs give him a twoedged sword and sandals for his feet and send him off wherever his heart desires” “mother” poised telemachus broke in now “my father’s bow— no achaean on earth has more right than i to give it or withhold it as i please of all the lords in ithaca’s rocky heights or the islands facing elis grazed by horses not a single one will force or thwart my will even if i decide to give our guest this bow— a gift outright—to carry off himself so mother go back to your quarters tend to your own tasks the distaff and the loom and keep the women working hard as well as for the bow now men will see to that but i most of all i hold the reins of power in this house” astonished she withdrew to her own room she took to heart the clear good sense in what her son had said climbing up to the lofty chamber with her women she fell to weeping for odysseus her beloved husband till watchful athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep and now the loyal swineherd had lifted up the bow was taking it toward the king when all the suitors burst out in an ugly uproar through the palace— brash young bullies this or that one heckling “where on earth are you going with that bow” “y ou you grubby swineherd are you crazy” “the speedy dogs you reared will eat your corpse—” “out there with your pigs out in the cold alone” “if only apollo and all the gods shine down on us” eumaeus froze in his tracks put down the bow panicked by every outcry in the hall telemachus shouted too from the other side and full of threats “carry on with the bow old boy if you serve too many masters you’ll soon suffer look sharp or i’ll pelt you back to your farm with ﬂying rocks i may be younger than you but i’m much stronger if only i had that edge in ﬁsts and brawn over all this courting crowd i’d soon dispatch them—licking their wounds at last— clear of our palace where they plot their vicious plots” his outburst sent them all into gales of laughter blithe and oblivious that dissolved their pique against the prince the swineherd took the bow carried it down the hall to his ready waiting king and standing by him placed it in his hands then he called the nurse aside and whispered “good eurycleia—telemachus commands you now to lock the snugly ﬁtted doors to your own rooms if anyone hears from there the jolting blows and groans of men caught in our huge net not one of you show your face— sit tight keep to your weaving not a sound” that silenced the old nurse— she barred the doors that led from the long hall the cowherd quietly bounded out of the house to lock the gates of the highstockaded court under the portico lay a cable ship’s tough gear he lashed the gates with this then slipped back in and ran and sat on the stool that he’d just left eyes riveted on odysseus now he held the bow in his own hands turning it over tip to tip testing it this way that way … fearing worms had bored through the weapon’s horn with the master gone abroad a suitor would glance at his neighbor jeering taunting “look at our connoisseur of bows” “sly old fox maybe he’s got bows like it stored in his house” “that or he’s bent on making one himself” “look how he twists and turns it in his hands” “the clever tramp means trouble—” “i wish him luck” some cocksure lord chimed in “as good as his luck in bending back that weapon” so they mocked but odysseus mastermind in action once he’d handled the great bow and scanned every inch then like an expert singer skilled at lyre and song— who strains a string to a new peg with ease making the pliant sheepgut fast at either end— so with his virtuoso ease odysseus strung his mighty bow quickly his right hand plucked the string to test its pitch and under his touch it sang out clear and sharp as a swallow’s cry horror swept through the suitors faces blanching white and zeus cracked the sky with a bolt his blazing sign and the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last that the son of cunning cronus ﬂung that omen down for him he snatched a winged arrow lying bare on the board— the rest still bristled deep inside the quiver soon to be tasted by all the feasters there setting shaft on the handgrip drawing the notch and bowstring back back … right from his stool just as he sat but aiming straight and true he let ﬂy— and never missing an ax from the ﬁrst axhandle clean on through to the last and out the shaft with its weighted brazen head shot free “my son” odysseus looked to telemachus and said “your guest sitting here in your house has not disgraced you no missing the mark look and no long labor spent to string the bow my strength’s not broken yet not quite so frail as the mocking suitors thought but the hour has come to serve our masters right— supper in broad daylight—then to other revels song and dancing all that crowns a feast” he paused with a warning nod and at that sign prince telemachus son of king odysseus girding his sharp sword on clamping hand to spear took his stand by a chair that ﬂanked his father— his bronze spearpoint glinting now like ﬁre … book xxii slaughter in the hall now stripping back his rags odysseus master of craft and battle vaulted onto the great threshold gripping his bow and quiver bristling arrows and poured his ﬂashing shafts before him loose at his feet and thundered out to all the suitors “look—your crucial test is ﬁnished now at last but another target’s left that no one’s hit before— we’ll see if i can hit it—apollo give me glory” with that he trained a stabbing arrow on antinous … just lifting a gorgeous golden lovingcup in his hands just tilting the twohandled goblet back to his lips about to drain the wine—and slaughter the last thing on the suitor’s mind who could dream that one foe in that crowd of feasters however great his power would bring down death on himself and black doom but odysseus aimed and shot antinous square in the throat and the point went stabbing clean through the soft neck and out— and off to the side he pitched the cup dropped from his grasp as the shaft sank home and the man’s lifeblood came spurting out his nostrils— thick red jets— a sudden thrust of his foot— he kicked away the table— food showered across the ﬂoor the bread and meats soaked in a swirl of bloody ﬁlth the suitors burst into uproar all throughout the house when they saw their leader down they leapt from their seats milling about desperate scanning the stone walls— not a shield in sight no rugged spear to seize they wheeled on odysseus lashing out in fury “stranger shooting at men will cost your life” “y our game is over—you you’ve shot your last” “y ou’ll never escape your own headlong death” “y ou killed the best in ithaca—our ﬁne prince” “vultures will eat your corpse” groping frantic— each one persuading himself the guest had killed the man by chance poor fools blind to the fact that all their necks were in the noose their doom sealed with a dark look the wily ﬁghter odysseus shouted back “y ou dogs you never imagined i’d return from troy— so cocksure that you bled my house to death ravished my servingwomen—wooed my wife behind my back while i was still alive no fear of the gods who rule the skies up there no fear that men’s revenge might arrive someday— now all your necks are in the noose—your doom is sealed” terror gripped them all blanched their faces white each man glancing wildly—how to escape his instant death only eurymachus had the breath to venture “if you you’re truly odysseus of ithaca home at last you’re right to accuse these men of what they’ve done— so much reckless outrage here in your palace so much on your lands but here he lies quite dead and he incited it all—antinous— look the man who drove us all to crime not that he needed marriage craved it so he’d bigger game in mind—though zeus barred his way— he’d lord it over ithaca’s handsome country king himself once he’d lain in wait for your son and cut him down but now he’s received the death that he deserved so spare your own people later we’ll recoup your costs with a tax laid down upon the land covering all we ate and drank inside your halls and each of us here will pay full measure too— twenty oxen in value bronze and gold we’ll give until we melt your heart before we’ve settled who on earth could blame you for your rage” but the battlemaster kept on glaring seething “no eurymachus not if you paid me all your father’s wealth— all you possess now and all that could pour in from the world’s end— no not even then would i stay my hands from slaughter till all you suitors had paid for all your crimes now life or death—your choice—ﬁght me or ﬂee if you hope to escape your sudden bloody doom i doubt one man in the lot will save his skin” his menace shook their knees their hearts too but eurymachus spoke again now to the suitors “friends this man will never restrain hi s hands invincible hands— now that he’s seized that polished bow and quiver look he’ll shoot from the sill until he’s killed us all so ﬁght—call up the joy of battle swords out tables lifted—block his arrows winging death charge him charge in a pack— try to rout the man from the sill the doors race through town and sound an alarm at once— our friend would soon see he’s shot his bolt” brave talk— he drew his twoedged sword bronze honed for the kill and hurled himself at the king with a raw savage cry in the same breath that odysseus loosed an arrow ripping his breast beside the nipple so hard it lodged in the man’s liver— out of his grasp the sword dropped to the ground— over his table head over heels he tumbled doubled up ﬂinging his food and his twohandled cup across the ﬂoor— he smashed the ground with his forehead writhing in pain both feet ﬂailing out and his high seat tottered— the mist of death came swirling down his eyes amphinomus rushed the king in all his glory charging him facetoface a slashing sword drawn— if only he could force him clear of the doorway now but telemachus—too quick—stabbed the man from behind plunging his bronze spear between the suitor’s shoulders and straight on through his chest the point came jutting out— down he went with a thud his forehead slammed the ground telemachus swerved aside leaving his long spearshaft lodged in amphinomus—fearing some suitor just might lunge in from behind as he tugged the shaft impale him with a sword or hack him down crouching over the corpse he went on the run reached his father at once and halting right beside him let ﬂy “father— now i’ll get you a shield and a pair of spears a helmet of solid bronze to ﬁt your temples i’ll arm myself on the way back and hand out arms to the swineherd arm the cowherd too— we’d better ﬁght equipped” “run fetch them” the wily captain urged “while i’ve got arrows left to defend me—or they’ll force me from the doors while i ﬁght on alone” telemachus moved to his father’s orders smartly off he ran to the room where the famous arms lay stored took up four shields eight spears four bronze helmets ridged with horsehair crests and loaded with these ran back to reach his father’s side in no time the prince was ﬁrst to case himself in bronze and his servants followed suit—both harnessed up and all three ﬂanked odysseus mastermind of war and he as long as he’d arrows left to defend himself kept picking suitors off in the palace one by one and down they went corpse on corpse in droves then when the royal archer’s shafts ran out he leaned his bow on a post of the massive doors— where walls of the hallway catch the light—and armed across his shoulder he slung a buckler four plies thick over his powerful head he set a wellforged helmet the horsehair crest atop it tossing bristling terror and grasped two rugged lances tipped with ﬁery bronze now a sidedoor was ﬁtted into the main wall— right at the edge of the great hall’s stone sill— and led to a passage always shut by good tight boards but odysseus gave the swineherd strict commands to stand hard by the sidedoor guard it well— the only way the suitors might break out agelaus called to his comrades with a plan “friends can’t someone climb through the hatch— tell men outside to sound the alarm be quick— our guest would soon see he’d shot his last” the goatherd melanthius answered “not a chance my lord—the door to the courtyard’s much too near dangerous too the mouth of the passage cramped one strong man could block us one and all no i’ll fetch you some armor to harness on out of the storeroom—there nowhere else i’m sure the king and his gallant son have stowed their arms” with that the goatherd clambered up through smokeducts high on the wall arid scurried into odysseus’ storeroom bundled a dozen shields as many spears and helmets ridged with horsehair crests and loaded with these rushed back down to the suitors quickly issued arms odysseus’ knees shook his heart too when he saw them buckling on their armor brandishing long spears— here was a battle looming well he knew he turned at once to telemachus warnings ﬂying “a b a d b r e a k i n t h e ﬁ g h t m y b o y o n e o f t h e w o m e n’s tipped the odds against us—or could it be the goatherd” “my fault father” the cool clear prince replied “the blame’s all mine that snug door to the vault i left it ajar—they’ve kept a better watch than i go eumaeus shut the door to the storeroom check and see if it’s one of the women’s tricks or dolius’ son melanthius he’s our man i’d say” and even as they conspired back the goatherd climbed to the room to fetch more burnished arms but eumaeus spotted him quickly told his king who stood close by “odysseus wily captain there he goes again the infernal nuisance— just as we suspected—back to the storeroom give me a clear command do i kill the man—if i can take him down— or drag him back to you here to pay in full for the dirty work he’s plotted in your house” odysseus master of tactics answered briskly “i and the prince will keep these brazen suitors crammed in the hall for all their battlefury yo u t w o w r e n c h m e l a n t h i u s ’ a r m s a n d l e g s b e h i n d h i m ﬂing him down in the storeroom—lash his back to a plank and strap a twisted cable fast to the scoundrel’s body hoist him up a column until he hits the rafters— let him dangle in agony still alive for a good long time” they hung on his orders keen to do his will off they ran to the storeroom unseen by him inside— melanthius rummaging after arms deep in a dark recess as the two men took their stand either side the doorposts poised till the goatherd tried to cross the doorsill … one hand clutching a crested helmet the other an ample old buckler blotched with mildew the shield laertes bore as a young soldier once— but there it lay for ages seams on the handstraps split— quick they rushed him seized him haled him back by the hair ﬂung him down on the ﬂoor writhing with terror bound him hand and foot with a chaﬁng cord wrenched his limbs back back till the joints locked tight— just as laertes’ cunning son commanded— they strapped a twisted cable round his body hoisted him up a column until he hit the rafters then you mocked him eumaeus my good swineherd “now stand guard through the whole night melanthius— stretched out on a soft bed ﬁt for you your highness yo u ’r e b o u n d t o s e e t h e m o r n i n g r i s i n g u p f r o m t h e o c e a n mounting her golden throne—at just the hour you always drive in goats to feast the suitors in the hall” so they left him trussed in his agonizing sling they clapped on armor again shut the gleaming doors and ran to rejoin odysseus mastermind of war and now as the ranks squared off breathing fury— four at the sill confronting a larger stronger force arrayed inside the hall—now zeus’s daughter athena taking the build and voice of mentor swept in and odysseus thrilled to see her cried out “rescue us mentor now it’s life or death remember your old comrade—all the service i offered you we were boys together” so he cried yet knew in his bones it was athena driver of armies but across the hall the suitors brayed against her agelaus ﬁrst his outburst full of threats “mentor never let odysseus trick you into siding with him to ﬁght against the suitors here’s our plan of action and we will see it through once we’ve killed them both the father and the son we’ll kill you too for all you’re bent on doing here in the halls—you’ll pay with your own head and once our swords have stopped your violence cold— all your property all in your house your ﬁelds we’ll lump it all with odysseus’ rich estate and never let your sons live on in your halls or free your wife and daughters to walk through town” naked threats—and athena hit new heights of rage she lashed out at odysseus no w with blazing accusations “where’s it gone odysseus—your power your ﬁghting heart the great soldier who fought for famous whitearmed helen battling trojans nine long years—nonstop no mercy mowing their armies down in grueling battle— you who seized the broad streets of troy with your ﬁne strategic stroke how can you — now you’ve returned to your own house your own wealth— bewail the loss of your combat strength in a war with suitors come old friend stand by me y ou’ll see action now see how mentor the son of alcimus that brave ﬁghter kills your enemies pays you back for service” rousing words— but she gave no allout turning of the tide not yet she kept on testing odysseus and his gallant son putting their force and ﬁghting heart to proof for all the world like a swallow in their sight she ﬂew on high to perch on the great hall’s central roofbeam black with smoke but the suitors closed ranks commanded now by damastor’s sonagelaus ﬂanked by eurynomus demoptolemus and amphimedon pisander polyctor’s son and polybus ready waiting— head and shoulders the best and bravest of the lot still left to ﬁght for their lives now that the pelting shafts had killed the rest agelaus spurred his comrades on with battleplans “friends at last the man’s invincible hands are useless mentor has mouthed some empty boasts and ﬂitted off— just four are left to ﬁght at the front doors so now no wasting your long spears—all at a single hurl just six of us launch out in the ﬁrst wave if zeus is willing we may hit odysseus carry off the glory the rest are nothing once the captain’s down” at his command concentrating their shots all six hurled as one but athena sent the whole salvo wide of the mark— one of them hit the jamb of the great hall’s doors another the massive door itself and the heavy bronze point of a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall seeing his men untouched by the suitors’ ﬂurry steady odysseus leapt to take command “friends now it’s for us to hurl at them i say into this ruck of suitors topping all their crimes they’re mad to strip the armor off our bodies” taking aim at the ranks all four let ﬂy as one and the lances struck home—o dysseus killed demoptolemus telemachus killed euryades—the swineherd elatus— and the cowherd cut pisander down in blood they bit the dust of the broad ﬂoor all as one back to the great hall’s far recess the others shrank as the four rushed in and plucked up spears from corpses and again the suitors hurled their whetted shafts but athena sent the better part of the salvo wide— one of them hit the jamb of the great hall’s doors another the massive door itself and the heavy bronze point of a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall true amphimedon nicked telemachus on the wrist— the glancing blade just barely broke his skin ctesippus sent a long spear sailing over eumaeus’ buckler grazing his shoulder blade but the weapon skittered off and hit the ground and again those led by the brilliant battlemaster hurled their razor spears at the suitors’ ranks— and now odysseus raider of cities hit eurydamas telemachus hit amphimedon—eumaeus polybus— and the cowherd stabbed ctesippus right in the man’s chest and triumphed over his body “love your mockery do you son of that blowhard polytherses no more shooting off your mouth you idiot such big talk— leave the last word to the gods—they’re much stronger take this spear this guestgift for the cow’s hoof you once gave king odysseus begging in his house” so the master of longhorn cattle had his say— as odysseus ﬁghting at close quarters ran agelaus through with a long lance—telemachus speared leocritus so deep in the groin the bronze came punching out his back and the man crashed headﬁrst slamming the ground fullface and now athena looming out of the rafters high above them brandished her mandestroying shield of thunder terrifying the suitors out of their minds and down the hall they panicked— wild like herds stampeding driv en mad as the darting gadﬂy strikes in the late spring when the long days come round the attackers struck like eagles crookclawed hookbeaked swooping down from a mountain ridge to harry smaller birds that skim across the ﬂatland cringing under the clouds but the eagles plunge in fury rip their lives out—hopeless never a chance of ﬂight or rescue—and people love the sport— so the attackers routed suitors headlong down the hall wheeling into the slaughter slashing left and right and grisly screams broke from skulls cracked open— the whole ﬂoor awash with blood leodes now— he ﬂung himself at odysseus clutched his knees crying out to the king with a sudden winging prayer “i hug your knees odysseus—mercy spare my life never i swear did i harass any woman in your house— never a word a gesture—nothing no i tried to restrain the suitors whoever did such things they wouldn’t listen keep their hands to themselves— so reckless so they earn their shameful fate but i was just their prophet— my hands are clean—and i’m to die their death look at the thanks i get for years of service” a killing look and the wry soldier answered “only a priest a prophet for this mob you say how hard you must have prayed in my own house that the heady day of my return would never dawn— my dear wife would be yours would bear your children for that there’s no escape from grueling death—you die” and snatching up in one powerful hand a sword left on the ground—agelaus dropped it when he fell— odysseus hacked the prophet square across the neck and the praying head went tumbling in the dust now one was left trying still to escape black death phemius terpis’ son the bard who always performed among the suitors— they forced the man to sing … there he stood backing into the sidedoor still clutching his ringing lyre in his hands his mind in turmoil torn—what should he do now steal from the hall and crouch at the altarstone of zeus who guards the court where time and again odysseus and laertes burned the long thighs of oxen or throw himself on the master’s mercy clasp his knees that was the better way—or so it struck him yes grasp the knees of laertes’ royal son and so cradling his hollow lyre he laid it on the ground between the mixingbowl and the silverstudded throne then rushed up to odysseus yes and clutched his knees singing out to his king with a stirring winged prayer “i hug your knees odysseus—mercy spare my life what a grief it will be to you for all the years to come if you kill the singer now who sings for gods and men i taught myself the craft but a god has planted deep in my spirit all the paths of song— songs i’m ﬁt to sing for you as for a god calm your bloodlust now—don’t take my head he’d bear me out your own dear son telemachus— never of my own will never for any gain did i perform in your house singing after the suitors had their feasts they were too strong too many— they forced me to come and sing—i had no choice” the inspired prince telemachus heard his pleas and quickly said to his father close beside him “stop don’t cut him down this one’s innocent so is the herald medon—the one who always tended me in the house when i was little— spare him too unless he’s dead by now killed by philoetius or eumaeus here— or ran into you rampaging through the halls” the herald pricked up his anxious ears at that … cautious soul he cowered trembling under a chair— wrapped in an oxhide freshly stripped—to dodge black death he jumped in a ﬂash from there threw off the smelly hide and scuttling up to telemachus clutching his knees the herald begged for life in words that ﬂuttered “here i am dear boy—spare me tell your father ﬂushed with victory not to kill me with his sword— enraged as he is with these young lords who bled his palace white and showed you no respect the reckless fools” breaking into a smile the canny odysseus reassured him “courage the prince has pulled you through he’s saved you now so you can take it to heart and tell the next man too clearly doing good puts doing bad to shame now leave the palace go and sit outside— out in the courtyard clear of the slaughter— you and the bard with all his many songs wait till i’ve done some household chores that call for my attention” the two men scurried out of the house at once and crouched at the altarstone of mighty zeus— glancing left and right fearing death would strike at any moment odysseus scanned his house to see if any man still skulked alive still hoped to avoid black death but he found them one and all in blood and dust … great hauls of them down and out like ﬁsh that ﬁshermen drag from the churning gray surf in looped and coiling nets and ﬂing ashore on a sweeping hook of beach—some noble catch heaped on the sand twitching lusting for fresh salt sea but the sungod hammers down and burns their lives out … so the suitors lay in heaps corpse covering corpse at last the seasoned ﬁghter turned to his son “telemachus go call the old nurse here— i must tell her all that’s on my mind” telemachus ran to do his father’s bidding shook the women’s doors calling eurycleia “come out now up with you good old woman yo u w h o w a t c h o v e r a l l t h e h o u s e h o l d h a n d s — quick my father wants you needs to have a word” crisp command that left the old nurse hushed— she spread the doors to the wellconstructed hall slipped out in haste and the prince led her on … she found odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses splattered with bloody ﬁlth like a lion that’s devoured some ox of the ﬁeld and lopes home covered with blood his chest streaked both jaws glistening dripping red— a sight to strike terror so odysseus looked now splattered with gore his thighs his ﬁghting hands and she when she saw the corpses all the pooling blood was about to lift a cry of triu mph—here was a great exploit look—but the soldier held her back and checked her zeal with warnings winging home “rejoice in your heart old woman—peace no cries of triumph now it’s unholy to glory over the bodies of the dead these men the doom of the gods has brought low and their own indecent acts they’d no regard for any man on earth—good or bad— who chanced to come their way and so thanks to their reckless work they met this shameful fate quick report in full on the women in my halls— who are disloyal to me who are guiltless” “surely child” his fond old nurse replied “now here’s the truth fifty women you have inside your house women we’ve trained to do their duties well to card the wool and bear the yoke of service some dozen in all went tramping to their shame thumbing their noses at me at the queen herself and telemachus just now come of age—his mother would never let the boy take charge of the maids but let me climb to her welllit room upstairs and tell your wife the news— some god has put the woman fast asleep” “don’t wake her yet” the crafty man returned “you tell those women to hurry here at once— just the ones who’ve shamed us all along” away the old nurse bustled through the house to give the women orders rush them to the king odysseus called telemachus over both herdsmen too with strict commands “start clearing away the bodies make the women pitch in too chairs and tables— scrub them down with sponges rinse them clean and once you’ve put the entire house in order march the women out of the great hall—between the roundhouse and the courtyard’s strong stockade— and hack them with your swords slash out all their lives— blot out of their minds the joys of love they relished under the suitors’ bodies rutting on the sly” the women crowded in huddling all together … wailing convulsively streaming live warm tears first they carried out the bodies of the dead and propped them under the courtyard colonnade standing them one against another odysseus shouted commands himself moving things along and they kept bearing out the bodies—they were forced next they scrubbed down the elegant chairs and tables washed them with sopping sp onges rinsed them clean then telemachus and the herdsmen scraped smooth the packed earth ﬂoor of the royal house with spades as the women gathered up the ﬁlth and piled it outside and then at last once the entire house was put in order they marched the women out of the great hall—between the roundhouse and the courtyard’s strong stockade— crammed them into a dead end no way out from there and stern telemachus gave the men their orders “no clean death for the likes of them by god not from me—they showered abuse on my head my mother’s too yo u s l u t s — t h e s u i t o r s ’ w h o r e s ” with that taking a cable used on a darkprowed ship he coiled it over the roundhouse lashed it fast to a tall column hoisting it up so high no toes could touch the ground then as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings against some snare rigged up in thickets—ﬂying in for a cozy nest but a grisly bed receives them— so the women’s heads were trapped in a line nooses yanking their necks up one by one so all might die a pitiful ghastly death … they kicked up heels for a little—not for long melanthius they hauled him out through the doorway into the court lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat raw and in manic fury hacked off hands and feet then once they’d washed their own hands and feet they went inside again to join odysseus their work was done with now but the king turned to devoted eurycleia saying “bring sulfur nurse to scour all this pollution— bring me ﬁre too so i can fumigate the house and call penelope here with all her women— tell all the maids to come back in at once” “well said my boy” his old nurse replied “right to the point but wait let me fetch you a shirt and cloak to wrap you no more dawdling round the palace nothing but rags to cover those broad shoulders—it’s a scandal” “fire ﬁrst” the good soldier answered “light me a ﬁre to purify this house” the devoted nurse snapped to his command brought her master ﬁre and brimstone odysseus purged his palace halls and court with cleansing fumes then back through the royal house the old nurse went to tell the women the news and bring them in at once they came crowding out of their quarters torch in hand ﬂung their arms around odysseus hugged him home at last and kissed his head and shoulders seized his hands and he overcome by a lovely longing broke down and wept … deep in his heart he knew them one and all book xxiii the great rooted bed up to the rooms the old nurse clambered chuckling all the way to tell the queen her husband was here now home at last her knees bustling feet shufﬂing over each other till hovering at her mistress’ head she spoke “penelope—child—wake up and see for yourself with your own eyes all you dreamed of all your days he’s here—odysseus—he’s co me home at long last he’s killed the suitors swaggering young brutes who plagued his house wolfed his cattle down rode roughshod over his son” “dear old nurse” wary penelope replied “the gods have made you mad they have that power putting lunacy into the clearest head around or setting a halfwit on the path to sense they’ve unhinged you and you were once so sane why do you mock me—haven’t i wept enough— telling such wild stories interrupting my sleep sweet sleep that held me sealed my eyes just now not once have i slept so soundly since the day odysseus sailed away to see that cursed city … destroy i call it—i hate to say its name now down you go back to your own quarters if any other woman of mine had come to me rousing me out of sleep with such a tale i’d have her bundled back to her room in pain it’s only your old gray head that spares you that” “never”—the fond old nurse kept pressing on— “dear child i’d never mock you no it’s all true he’s here—odysseus—he’s come home just as i tell you he’s the stranger they all manhandled in the hall telemachus knew he was here for days and days but he knew enough to hide his father’s plans so he could pay those vipers back in kind” penelope’s heart burst in joy she leapt from bed her eyes streaming tears she hugged the old nurse and cried out with an eager winging word “please dear one give me the whole story if he’s really home again just as you tell me how did he get those shameless suitors in his clutches— singlehanded braving an army always camped inside” “i have no idea” the devoted nurse replied “i didn’t see it i didn’t ask—all i heard was the choking groans of men cut down in blood we crouched in terror—a dark nook of our quarters— all of us locked tight behind those snug doors till your boy telemachus came and called me out— his father rushed him there to do just that then i found odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses there he stood and all around him over the beaten ﬂoor the bodies sprawled in heaps lying one on another … how it would have thrilled your heart to see him— splattered with bloody ﬁlth a lion with his kill and now they’re all stacked at the courtyard gates— he’s lit a roaring ﬁre he’s purifying the house with cleansing fumes and he’s sent me here to bring you back to him follow me down so now after all the years of grief you two can embark loving hearts along the road to joy look your dreams put off so long come true at last— he’s back alive home at his hearth and found you found his son still here and all those suitors who did him wrong he’s paid them back he has right in his own house” “hush dear woman” guarded penelope cautioned her at once “don’t laugh don’t cry in triumph—not yet yo u k n o w h o w w e l c o m e t h e s i g h t o f h i m w o u l d b e to all in the house and to me most of all and the son we bore together but the story can’t be true not as you tell it no it must be a god who’s killed our brazen friends— up in arms at their outrage heartbreaking crimes they’d no regard for any man on earth— good or bad—who chanced to come their way so thanks to their reckless wo rk they die their deaths odysseus far from achaea now he’s lost all hope of coming home … he’s lost and gone himself” “child” the devoted old nurse protested “what nonsense you let slip through your teeth here’s your husband warming his hands at his own hearth here—and you you say he’ll never come home again always the soul of trust all right this too— i’ll give you a sign a proof that’s plain as day that scar made years ago by a boar’s white tusk— i spotted the scar myself when i washed his feet and i tried to tell you ah but he the crafty rascal clamped his hand on my mouth—i couldn’t say a word follow me down now i’ll stake my life on it if i am lying to you — kill me with a thousand knives of pain” “dear old nurse” composed penelope responded “deep as you are my friend you’ll ﬁnd it hard to plumb the plans of the everlasting gods all the same let’s go and join my son so i can see the suitors lying dead and see … the one who killed them” with that thought penelope started down from her lofty room her heart in turmoil torn … should she keep her distance probe her husband or rush up to the man at once and kiss his head and cling to both his hands as soon as she stepped across the stone threshold slipping in she took a seat at the closest wall and radiant in the ﬁrelight faced odysseus now there he sat leaning agains t the great central column eyes ﬁxed on the ground waiting poised for whatever words his hardy wife might say when she caught sight of him a long while she sat in silence … numbing wonder ﬁlled her heart as her eyes explored his face one moment he seemed … odysseus to the life— the next no he was not the man she knew a huddled mass of rags was all she saw “oh mother” telemachus reproached her “cruel mother you with your hard heart why do you spurn my father so—why don’t you sit beside him engage him ask him questions what other wife could have a spirit so unbending holding back from her husband home at last for her after bearing twenty years of brutal struggle— your heart was always harder than a rock” “my child” penelope wellaware explained “i’m stunned with wonder powerless cannot speak to him ask him questions look him in the eyes … but if he is truly odysseus home at last make no mistake we two will know each other even better— we two have secret signs known to us both but hidden from the world” odysseus longenduring broke into a smile and turned to his son with pointed winging words “leave your mother here in the hall to test me as she will she soon will know me better now because i am ﬁlthy wear such grimy rags she spurns me—your mother still can’t bring herself to believe i am her husband but you and i put heads together what’s our best defense when someone kills a lone man in the realm who leaves behind him no great band of avengers still the killer ﬂees goodbye to kin and country but we brought down the best of the island’s princes the pillars of ithaca weigh it well i urge you” “look to it all yourself now father” his son deferred at once “y ou are the best on earth they say when it comes to mapping tactics no one no mortal man can touch you there but we’re behind you hearts intent on battle nor do i think you’ll ﬁnd us short on courage long as our strength will last” “then here’s our plan” the master of tactics said “i think it’s best first go and wash and pull fresh tunics on and tell the maids in the hall to dress well too and let the inspired bard take up his ringing lyre and lead off for us all a dance so full of heart that whoever hears the strains outside the gates— a passerby on the road a neighbor round about— will think it’s a weddingfeast that’s under way no news of the suitors’ death must spread through town till we have slipped away to our own estates our orchard green with trees there we’ll see what winning strategy ze us will hand us then” they hung on his words and moved to orders smartly first they washed and pulled fresh tunics on the women arrayed themselves—the inspired bard struck up his resounding lyre and stirred in all a desire for dance and song the lovely lilting beat till the great house echoed round to the measured tread of dancing men in motion women sashed and lithe and whoever heard the strains outside would say “a m i r a c l e — s o m e o n e ’s m a r r i e d t h e q u e e n a t l a s t ” “one of her hundred suitors” “that callous woman too faithless to keep her lord and master’s house to the bitter end—” “till he came sailing home” so they’d say blind to what had happened the greathearted odysseus was home again at last the maid eurynome bathed him rubbed him down with oil and drew around him a royal cape and choice tunic too and athena crowned the man with beauty head to foot made him taller to all eyes his build more massive yes and down from his brow the great goddess ran his curls like thick hyacinth clusters full of blooms as a master craftsman washes gold over beaten silver—a man the god of ﬁre and queen athena trained in every ﬁne technique— and ﬁnishes of his latest effort handsome work … so she lavished splendor over his head and shoulders now he stepped from his bath glistening like a god and back he went to the seat that he had left and facing his wife declared “strange woman so hard—the gods of olympus made you harder than any other woman in the world what other wife could have a spirit so unbending holding back from her husband home at last for her after bearing twenty years of brutal struggle come nurse make me a bed i’ll sleep alone she has a heart of iron in her breast” “strange man ” wary penelope said “i’m not so proud so scornful nor am i overwhelmed by your quick change … yo u l o o k — h o w w e l l i k n o w — t h e w a y h e l o o k e d setting sail from ithaca years ago aboard the longoared ship come eurycleia move the sturdy bedstead out of our bridal chamber— that room the master built with his own hands take it out now sturdy bed that it is and spread it deep with ﬂeece blankets and lustrous throws to keep him warm” putting her husband to the proof—but odysseus blazed up in fury lashing out at his loyal wife “woman—your words they cut me to the core who could move my bed impossible task even for some skilled craftsman—unless a god came down in person quick to lend a hand lifted it out with ease and moved it elsewhere not a man on earth not even at peak strength would ﬁnd it easy to prise it up and shift it no a great sign a hallmark lies in its construction i know i built it myself—no one else … there was a branching olivetree inside our court grown to its full prime the bole like a column thickset around it i built my bedroom ﬁnished off the walls with good tight stonework roofed it over soundly and added doors hung well and snugly wedged then i lopped the leafy crown of the olive cleancutting the stump bare from roots up planing it round with a bronze smoothingadze— i had the skill—i shaped it plumb to the line to make my bedpost bored the holes it needed with an auger working from there i built my bed start to ﬁnish i gave it ivory inlays gold and silver ﬁttings wove the straps across it oxhide gleaming red there’s our secret sign i tell you our life story does the bed my lady still stand planted ﬁrm— i don’t know—or has someone chopped away that olivetrunk and hauled our bedstead off” living proof— penelope felt her knees go slack her heart surrender recognizing the strong clear signs odysseus offered she dissolved in tears rushed to odysseus ﬂung her arms around his neck and kissed his head and cried out “odysseus —don’t ﬂare up at me now not you always the most understanding man alive the gods it was the gods who sent us sorrow— they grudged us both a life in each other’s arms from the heady zest of youth to the stoop of old age but don’t fault me angry with me now because i failed at the ﬁrst glimpse to greet you hold you so … in my heart of hearts i always cringed with fear some fraud might come beguile me with his talk the world is full of the sort cunning ones who plot their own dark ends remember helen of argos zeus’s daughter— would she have sported so in a stranger’s bed if she had dreamed that achaea’s sons were doomed to ﬁght and die to bring her home again some god spurred her to do her shameless work not till then did her mind conceive that madness blinding madness that caused her anguish ours as well but now since you have revealed such overwhelming proof— the secret sign of our bed which no one’s ever seen but you and i and a single handmaid actoris the servant my father gave me when i came who kept the doors of our room you built so well … you’ve conquered my heart my hard heart at last” the more she spoke the more a deep desire for tears welled up inside his breast—he wept as he held the wife he loved the soul of loyalty in his arms at last joy warm as the joy that shipwrecked sailors feel when they catch sight of land—poseidon has struck their wellrigged ship on the open sea with gale winds and crushing walls of waves an d only a few escape swimming struggling out of the frothing surf to reach the shore their bodies crusted with salt but buoyed up with joy as they plant their feet on solid ground again spared a deadly fate so joyous now to her the sight of her husband vivid in her gaze that her white arms embracing his neck would never for a moment let him go … dawn with her rosered ﬁngers might have shone upon their tears if with her glinting eyes athena had not thought of one more thing she held back the night and night lingered long at the western edge of the earth while in the east she reined in dawn of the golden throne at ocean’s banks commanding her not to yoke the windswift team that brings men light blaze and aurora the young colts that race the morning on ye t n o w o d y s s e u s s e a s o n e d v e t e r a n s a i d t o h i s w i f e “dear woman … we have still not reached the end of all our trials one more labor lies in store— boundless laden with danger great and long and i must brave it out from start to ﬁnish so the ghost of tiresias prophesied to me the day that i went down to the house of death to learn our best route home my comrades’ and my own but come let’s go to bed dear woman—at long last delight in sleep delight in each other come” “if it’s bed you want” reserved penelope replied “it’s bed you’ll have whenever the spirit moves now that the gods have brought you home again to native land your grand and gracious house but since you’ve alluded to it since a god has put it in your mind please tell me about this trial still to come i’m bound to learn of it later i am sure— what’s the harm if i hear of it tonight” “still so strange” odysseus the old master of stories answered “why again why force me to tell you all well tell i shall i’ll hide nothing now but little joy it will bring you i’m afraid as little joy for me the prophet said that i must rove through towns on towns of men that i must carry a wellplaned oar until i come to a people who know nothing of the sea whose food is never seasoned with salt strangers all to ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars wings that make ships ﬂy and here is my sign he told me clear so clear i cannot miss it and i will share it with you now … when another traveler falls in with me and calls that weight across my shoulder a fan to winnow grain then he told me i must plant my oar in the earth and sacriﬁce ﬁne beasts to the lord god of the sea poseidon—a ram a bull and a ramping wild boar— then journey home and render noble offerings up to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies to all the gods in order and at last my own death will steal upon me … a gentle painless death far from the sea it comes to take me down borne down with the years in ripe old age with all my people here in blessed peace around me all this the prophet said will come to pass” “a n d s o ” p e n e l o p e s a i d i n h e r g r e a t w i s d o m “if the gods will really grant a happier old age there’s hope that we’ll escape our trials at last” so husband and wife conﬁded in each other while nurse and eurynome under the ﬂaring brands were making up the bed with coverings deep and soft and working briskly soon as they’d made it snug back to her room the old nurse went to sleep as eurynome their attendant torch in hand lighted the royal couple’s way to bed and leading them to their chamber slipped away rejoicing in each other they returned to their bed the old familiar place they loved so well now telemachus the cowherd and the swineherd rested their dancing feet and had the women do the same and across the shadowed hall the men lay down to sleep but the royal couple once they’d reveled in all the longedfor joys of love reveled in each other’s stories the radiant woman telling of all she’d borne at home watching them there the infernal crowd of suitors slaughtering herds of cattle and good fat sheep— while keen to win her hand— draining the broached vats dry of vintage wine and great odysseus told his wife of all the pains he had dealt out to other men and all the hardships he’d endured himself—his story ﬁrst to last— and she listened on enchanted … sleep never sealed her eyes till all was told he launched in with how he fought the cicones down then how he came to the lotuseaters’ lush green land then all the crimes of the cyclops and how he paid him back for the gallant men the monster ate without a qualm— then how he visited aeolus who gave him a hero’s welcome then he sent him off but the homeward run was not his fate not yet—some sudden squalls snatched him away once more and drove him over the swarming sea groaning in despair then how he moored at telepylus where laestrygonians wrecked his ﬂeet and killed his menatarms he told her of circe’s cunning magic wiles and how he voyaged down in his long benched ship to the moldering house of death to consult tiresias ghostly seer of thebes and he saw old comrades there and he saw his mother who bore and reared him as a child he told how he caught the sirens’ voices throbbing in the wind and how he had scudded past the clashing rocks past grim charybdis past scylla—whom no rover had ever coasted by home free— and how his shipmates slaughtered the cattle of the sun and zeus the king of thunder split his racing ship with a reeking bolt and killed his hardy comrades all his ﬁghting men at a stroke but he alone escaped their death at sea he told how he reached ogygia’s shores and the nymph calypso held him back deep in her arching caverns craving him for a husband— cherished him vowed to make hi m immortal ageless all his days yes but she never won the heart inside him never … then how he reached the phaeacians—heavy sailing there— who with all their hearts had prized him like a god and sent him off in a ship to his own beloved land giving him bronze and hoards of gold and robes … and that was the last he told her just as sleep overcame him … sleep loosing his limbs slipping the toils of anguish from his mind athena her eyes aﬁre had fresh plans once she thought he’d had his heart’s content of love and sleep at his wife’s side straightaway she roused young dawn from ocean’s banks to her golden throne to bring men light and roused odysseus too who rose from his soft bed and advised his wife in parting “dear woman we both have had our ﬁll of trials yo u i n o u r h o u s e w e e p i n g o v e r m y j o u r n e y h o m e fraught with storms and torment true and i pinned down in pain by zeus and other gods for all my desire blocked from reaching home but now that we’ve arrived at our bed together— the reunion that we yearned for all those years— look after the things still left me in our house but as for the ﬂocks those strutting suitors plundered much i’ll recoup myself making many raids the rest our fellowithacans will supply till all my folds are full of sheep again but now i must be off to the upland farm our orchard green with trees to see my father good old man weighed down with so much grief for me and you dear woman sensible as you are i would advise you still … quick as the rising sun the news will spread of the suitors that i killed inside the house so climb to your lofty chamber with your women sit tight there see no one question no one” he strapped his burnished armor round his shoulders roused telemachus the cowherd and the swineherd and told them to take up weapons honed for battle they snapped to commands harnessed up in bronze opened the doors and strode out odysseus in the lead by now the daylight covered the land but pallas shrouding them all in darkness quickly led the four men out of town book xxiv peace now cyllenian hermes called away the suitors’ ghosts holding ﬁrm in his hand the wand of ﬁne pure gold that enchants the eyes of men whenever hermes wants or wakes us up from sleep with a wave of this he stirred and led them on and the ghosts trailed after with high thin cries as bats cry in the depths of a dark haunted cavern shrilling ﬂittering wild when one drops from the chain— slipped from the rock face while the rest cling tight … so with their high thin cr ies the ghosts ﬂocked now and hermes the healer led them on and down the dank moldering paths and past the ocean’s streams they went and past the white rock and the sun’s western gates and past the land of dreams and they soon reached the ﬁelds of asphodel where the dead the burntout wraiths of mortals make their home there they found the ghosts of peleus’ son achilles patroclus fearless antilochus—and great ajax too the ﬁrst in stature ﬁrst in build and bearing of all the argives after peleus’ matchless son they had grouped around achilles’ ghost and now the shade of atreus’ son agamemnon marched toward them— fraught with grief and ﬂank ed by all his comrades troops of his menatarms who died beside him who met their fate in lord aegisthus’ halls achilles’ ghost was ﬁrst to greet him “ agamemnon you were the one we thought of all our ﬁghting princes zeus who loves the lightning favored most all your days because you commanded such a powerful host of men on the ﬁelds of troy where we achaeans suffered but you were doomed to encounter fate so early you too yet no one born escapes its deadly force if only you had died your death in the full ﬂush of the glory you had mastered—died on trojan soil then all united achaea would have raised your tomb and you’d have won your son great fame for years to come not so y ou were fated to die a wretched death” and the ghost of atrides agamemnon answered “son of peleus great godlike achilles happy man you died on the ﬁelds of troy a world away from home and the best of trojan and argive champions died around you ﬁghting for your corpse and you … there you lay in the whirling dust overpowered in all your power and wiped from memory all your horseman’s skills that whole day we fought we’d never have stopped if zeus had not stopped us with sudden gales then we bore you out of the ﬁghting onto the ships we laid you down on a litter cleansed your handsome ﬂesh with warm water and soothing oils and round your body troops of danaans wept hot tears and cut their locks hearing the news your mother thetis rose from the sea immortal seanymphs in her wake and a strange unearthly cry came throbbing over the ocean terror gripped achaea’s armies they would have leapt in panic boarded the long hollow ships if one man deep in his ageold wisdom had not checked them nestor—from the ﬁrst his counsel always seemed the best and now concerned for the ranks he rose and shouted ‘hold fast argives sons of achaea don’t run now this is achilles’ mother rising from the sea with all her immortal seanymphs— she longs to join her son who died in battle’ that stopped our panicked forces in their tracks as the old man of the sea’s daughters gathered round you— wailing heartsick—dressed you in ambrosial deathless robes and the muses nine in all voicetovoice in choirs their vibrant music rising raised your dirge not one soldier would you have seen dryeyed the muses’ song so pierced us to the heart for seventeen days unbroken days and nights we mourned you—immortal gods and mortal men at the eighteenth dawn we gave you to the ﬂames and slaughtered around your body droves of fat sheep and shambling longhorn cattle and you were burned in the garments of the gods an d laved with soothing oils and honey running sweet and a long cortege of argive heroes paraded in review in battle armor round your blazing pyre men in chariots men on foot—a resounding roar went up and once the god of ﬁre had burned your corpse to ash at ﬁrst light we gathered your white bones achilles cured them in strong neat wine and seasoned oils yo u r m o t h e r g a v e u s a g o l d t w o h a n d l e d u r n a gift from dionysus she said a masterwork of the famous smith the god of ﬁre yo u r w h i t e b o n e s r e s t i n t h a t m y b r i l l i a n t a c h i l l e s mixed with the bones of dead patroclus menoetius’ son apart from those of antilochus whom you treasured more than all other comrades once patroclus died over your bones we reared a grand noble tomb— devoted veterans all achaea’s combat forces— high on its jutting headland over the hellespont’s broad reach a landmark glimpsed from far out at sea by men of our own day and men of days to come and then your mother begging the gods for priceless trophies set them out in the ring for all our champions yo u i n y o u r d a y h a v e w i t n e s s e d f u n e r a l g a m e s for many heroes games to honor the death of kings when young men cinch their belts tense to win some prize— but if you’d laid eyes on these it would have thrilled your heart magniﬁcent trophies the goddess glisteningfooted thetis held out in your honor y ou were dear to the gods so even in death your name will never die … great glory is yours achilles for all time in the eyes of all mankind but i what joy for me when the coil of war had wound down for my return zeus hatched a pitiful death at the hands of aegisthus—and my accursed wife” as they exchanged the stories of their fates hermes the guide and giantkiller drew up close to both leading down the ghosts of the suitors king odysseus killed struck by the sight the two went up to them right away and the ghost of atreus’ son agamemnon recognized the noted prince amphimedon melaneus’ dear son who received him once in ithaca at his home and atrides’ ghost called out to his old friend now “a m p h i m e d o n w h a t d i s a s t e r b r i n g s y o u d o w n t o t h e d a r k w o r l d all of you good picked men and all in your prime— no captain out to recruit the best in any city could have chosen better what laid you low wrecked in the ships when lord poseidon roused some punishing blast of gales and heavy breakers or did ranks of enemies mow you down on land as you tried to raid and cut off herds and ﬂocks or fought to win their city take their women answer me tell me i was once your guest don’t you recall the day i came to visit your house in ithaca—king menelaus came too— to urge odysseus to sail with us in the ships on our campaign to troy and the long slow voyage crossing wastes of ocean cost us one whole month that’s how hard it was to bring him round odysseus raider of cities” “famous atrides” amphimedon’s ghost called back “lord of men agamemnon i remember it all your majesty as you say and i will tell you start to ﬁnish now the story of our death the brutal end contrived to take us off we were courting the wife of odysseus gone so long she neither spurned nor embraced a marriage she despised no she simply planned our death our black doom this was her latest masterpiece of guile she set up a great loom in the royal halls and she began to weave and the weaving ﬁnespun the yarns endless and she would lead us on ‘y oung men my suitors now that king odysseus is no more go slowly keen as you are to marry me until i can ﬁnish off this web … so my weaving won’t all fray and come to nothing this is a shroud for old lord laertes for that day when the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down i dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me yes if a man of such wealth should lie in state without a shroud for cover’ her very words and despite our pride and passion we believed her so by day she’d weave at her great and growing web— by night by the light of torches set beside her she would unravel all she’d done three whole years she deceived us blind seduced us with this scheme … then when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on and the months waned and the long days came round once more one of her women in on the queen’s secret told the truth and we caught her in the act—unweaving her gorgeous web so she ﬁnished it off against her will we forced her but just as she bound off that great shroud and washed it spread it out—glistening like the sunlight or the moon— just then some wicked spirit brought odysseus back from god knows where to the edge of his estate where the swineherd kept his pigs and back too to the same place came odysseus’ own dear son scudding home in his black ship from sandy pylos the pair of them schemed our doom our deathtrap then lit out for town— telemachus ﬁrst in fact odysseus followed later led by the swineherd and clad in tatters looking for all the world like an old and broken beggar hunched on a stick his body wrapped in shameful rags disguised so none of us not even the older ones could spot that tramp for the man he really was bursting in on us there out of the blue no we attacked him blows and insults ﬂying fast and he took it all for a time in his own house all the taunts and blows—he had a heart of iron but once the will of thundering zeus had roused his blood he and telemachus bore the burnished weapons off and stowed them deep in a storeroom shot the bolts and he—the soul of cunning—told his wife to set the great bow and the gleaming iron axes out before the suitors—all of us doomed now— to test our skill and bring our slaughter on … not one of us had the strength to string that powerful weapon all of us fell far short of what it took but then when the bow was coming ro und to odysseus’ hands we raised a hue and cry—he must not have it no matter how he begged only telemachus urged him to take it up and once he got it in his clutches longsuffering great odysseus strung his bow with ease and shot through all the axes then vaulting onto the threshold stood there poised and pouring his ﬂashing arrows out before him glaring for the kill he cut antinous down then shot his painful arrows into the rest of us aiming straight and true and down we went corpse on corpse in droves clearly a god was driving him and all his henchmen routing us headlong in their fury down the hall wheeling into the slaughter slashing left and right and grisly screams broke from skulls cracked open— the whole ﬂoor awash with blood so we died agamemnon … our bodies lie untended even now strewn in odysseus’ palace they know nothing yet the kin in our houses who might wash our wounds of clotted gore and lay us out and mourn us these are the solemn honors owed the dead” “happy odysseus” agamemnon’s ghost cried out “son of old laertes— mastermind—what a ﬁne faithful wife you won what good sense resided in your penelope— how well icarius’ daughter remembered you odysseus the man she married once the fame of her great virtue will never die the immortal gods will lift a song for all mankind a glorious song in praise of selfpossessed penelope a far cry from the daughter of tyndareus clytemnestra— what outrage she committed killing the man she married once— yes and the song men sing of her will ring with loathing she brands with a foul name the breed of womankind even the honest ones to come” so they traded stories the two ghosts standing ther e in the house of death far in the hidden depths below the earth odysseus and his men had stridden down from town and quickly reached laertes’ large welltended farm that the old king himself had wrested from the wilds years ago laboring long and hard his lodge was here and around it stretched a row of sheds where ﬁeldhands bondsmen who did his bidding sat and ate and slept with an old sicilian woman too much in charge who faithfully looked after her aged master out on his good estate remote from town odysseus told his servants and his son “into the timbered lodge now go quickly kill us the fattest porker ﬁx our meal and i will put my father to the test see if the old man knows me now on sight or fails to after twenty years apart” with that he passed his armor to his men and in they went at once his son as well odysseus wandered off approaching the thriving vineyard searching picking his way down to the great orchard searching but found neither dolius nor his sons nor any hand they’d just gone off old dolius in the lead to gather stones for a dry retaining wall to shore the vineyard up but he did ﬁnd his father alone on that wellworked plot spading round a sapling—clad in ﬁlthy rags in a patched unseemly shirt and round his shins he had some oxhide leggings strapped patched too to keep from getting scraped and gloves on his hands to ﬁght against the thorns and on his head he wore a goatskin skullcap to cultivate his misery that much more … longenduring odysseus catc hing sight of him now— a man worn down with years his heart racked with sorrow— halted under a branching peartree paused and wept debating head and heart what should he do now kiss and embrace his father pour out the long tale— how he had made the journey home to native land— or probe him ﬁrst and test him every way torn mulling it over this seemed better test the old man ﬁrst reproach him with words that cut him to the core convinced odysseus went right up to his father laertes was digging round the sapling head bent low as his famous offspring hovered over him and began “y ou want no skill old man at tending a garden all’s wellkept here not one thing in the plot no plant no ﬁg no pear no olive no vine not a vegetable lacks your tender loving care but i must say—and don’t be offended now— your plants are doing better than yourself enough to be stooped with age but look how squalid you are those shabby rags surely it’s not for sloth your master lets you go to seed there’s nothing of slave about your build or bearing i have eyes you look like a king to me the sort entitled to bathe sup well then sleep in a soft bed that’s the right and pride of you oldtimers come now tell me—in no uncertain terms— whose slave are you whose orchard are you tending and tell me this—i must be absolutely sure— this place i’ve reached is it truly ithaca just as that fellow told me just now … i fell in with him on the road here clumsy none too friendly couldn’t trouble himself to hear me out or give me a decent answer when i asked about a longlost friend of mine whether he’s still alive somewhere in ithaca or dead and gone already lost in the house of death do you want to hear his story listen catch my drift i once played host to a man in my own country he’d come to my door the most welcome guest from foreign parts i ever entertained he claimed he came of good ithacan stock said his father was arcesius’ son laertes so i took the new arrival under my own roof i gave him a hero’s welcome treated him in style— stores in our palace made for princely entertainment and i gave my friend some gifts to ﬁt his station handed him seven bars of wellwrought gold a mixingbowl of solid silver etched with ﬂowers a dozen cloaks unlined and light a dozen rugs and as many fullcut capes and shirts as well and to top it off four women perfect beauties skilled in crafts—he could pick them out himself” “stranger” his father answered weeping softly “the land you’ve reached is the very one you’re after true but it’s in the grip of reckless lawless men and as for the gifts you showered on your guest you gave them all for nothing but if you’d found him alive here in ithaca he would have replied in kind with gift for gift and entertained you warmly before he sent you off that’s the old custom when one has led the way but tell me please—in no uncertain terms— how many years ago did you host the man that unfortunate guest of yours my son … there was a son or was he all a dream that most unlucky man whom now i fear far from his own soil and those he loves the ﬁsh have swallowed down on the high seas or birds and beasts on land have made their meal nor could the ones who bore him—mother father— wrap his corpse in a shroud and mourn him deeply nor could his warm generous wife so selfpossessed penelope ever keen for her husband on his deathbed the ﬁt and proper way or close his eyes at last these are the solemn honors owed the dead but tell me your own story—that i’d like to know who are you where are you from your city your parents where does the ship lie moored that brought you here your hardy shipmates too or did you arrive as a passenger aboard some stranger’s craft and men who put you ashore have pulled away” “the whole tale” his crafty son replied “i’ll tell you start to ﬁnish i come from roamertown my home’s a famous place my father’s unsparing son of old king pain and my name’s man of strife … i sailed from sicily aye but some ill wind blew me here off course—much against my will— and my ship lies moored off farmlands far from town as for odysseus well ﬁve years have passed since he left my house and put my land behind him luckless man but the birds were good as he launched out all on the right and i rejoiced as i sent him off and he rejoiced in sailing we had high hopes we’d meet again as guests as old friends and trade some shining gifts” at those words a black cloud of grief came shrouding over laertes both hands clawing the ground for dirt and grime he poured it over his grizzled head sobbing in spasms odysseus’ heart shuddered a sudden twinge went shooting up through his nostrils watching his dear father struggle … he sprang toward him kissed him hugged him crying “father—i am your son—myself the man you’re seeking home after twenty years on native ground at last hold back your tears your grief let me tell you the news but we must hurry— i’ve cut the suitors down in our own house i’ve paid them back their outrage vicious crimes” “odysseus laertes catching his breath found words to answer “y ou—you’re truly my son odysseus home at last give me a sign some proof—i must be sure” “this scar ﬁrst” quick to the mark his son said “look at this— the wound i took from the boar’s white tusk on mount parnassus there you’d sent me you and mother to see her fond old father autolycus and collect the gifts he vowed to give me once when he came to see us here or these these trees— let me tell you the trees you gave me years ago here on this wellworked plot … i begged you for everything i saw a little boy trailing you through the orchard picking our way among these trees and you named them one by one yo u g a v e m e t h i r t e e n p e a r t e n a p p l e t r e e s and forty ﬁgs—and promised to give me look ﬁfty vinerows bearing hard on each other’s heels clusters of grapes yearround at every grade of ripeness mellowed as zeus’s seasons weigh them down” living proof— and laertes’ knees went slack his heart surrendered recognizing the strong clear signs odysseus offered he threw his arms around his own dear son fainting as hardy great odysseus hugged him to his heart until he regained his breath came back to life and cried out “father zeus— you gods of olympus you still rule on high if those suitors have truly paid in blood for all their reckless outrage oh but now my heart quakes with fear that all the ithacans will come down on us in a pack at any time and rush the alarm through every island town” “there’s nothing to fear” his canny son replied “put it from your mind let’s make for your lodge beside the orchard here i sent telemachus on ahead the cowherd swineherd too to ﬁx a hasty meal” so the two went home conﬁding all the way and arriving at the ample timbered lodge they found telemachus with the two herdsmen carving sides of meat and mixing ruddy wine before they ate the sicilian servingwoman bathed her master laertes—his spirits high in his own room—and rubbed him down with oil and round his shoulders drew a fresh new cloak and athena stood beside him ﬂeshing out the limbs of the old commander made him taller to all eyes his build more massive st epping from his bath so his own son gazed at him wonderstruck— facetoface he seemed a deathless god … “father”—odysseus’ words had wings—”surely one of the everlasting gods has made you taller stronger shining in my eyes” facing his son the wise old man returned “if only—father zeus athena and lord apollo— i were the man i was king of the cephallenians when i sacked the city of nericus sturdy fortress out on its jutting cape if i’d been young in arms last night in our house with harness on my back standing beside you ﬁghting off the suitors how many i would have cut the knees from under— the heart inside you would have leapt for joy” so father and son conﬁrmed each other’s spirits and then with the roasting done the meal set out the others took their seats on chairs and stools were just putting their hands to bread and meat when old dolius trudged in with his sons worn out from the ﬁeldwork the old sicilian had gone and fetched them home the mother who reared the boys and tended dolius well now that the years had ground the old man down … when they saw odysseus—k new him in their bones— they stopped in their tracks staring struck dumb but the king waved them on with a warm and easy air “sit down to your food old friend snap out of your wonder we’ve been cooling our heels here long enough eager to get our hands on all this pork hoping you’d all troop in at any moment” spreading his arms dolius rushed up to him clutched odysseus by the wrist and kissed his hand greeting his king now with a burst of winging words “dear master you’re back—the answer to our prayers we’d lost all hope but the gods have brought you home welcome—health the skies rain blessings on you but tell me the truth now—this i’d like to know— shrewd penelope has she heard you’re home or should we send a messenger” “she knows by now old man” his wily master answered brusquely “why busy yourself with that” so dolius went back to his sanded stool his sons too pressing around the famous king greeted odysseus warmly grasped him by the hand then took their seats in order by their father but now as they fell to supper in the lodge rumor the herald sped like wildﬁre through the city crying out the news of the suitors’ bloody death and doom and massing from every quarter as they listened kinsmen milled with wails and moans of grief before odysseus’ palace and then they carried out the bodies every family buried their own and the dead from other towns they loaded onto the rapid ships for crews to ferry back again each to his own home … then in a long mourning ﬁle they moved to assembly where once they’d grouped crowding the meeting grounds old lord eupithes rose in their midst to speak out unforgettable sorrow wrung his heart for his son antinous the ﬁrst that great odysseus killed in tears for the one he lost he stood and cried “my friends what a mortal blow this man has dealt to all our island people thos e ﬁghters many and brave he led away in his curved ships—he lost the ships and he lost the men and back he comes again to kill the best of our cephallenian princes quick after him before he ﬂees to pylos or holy elis where epeans rule in power— up attack or we’ll hang our heads forever all disgraced even by generations down the years if we don’t punish the murderers of our brothers and our sons why life would lose its relish—for me at least— i’d rather die at once and go among the dead attack—before the assassins cross the sea and leave us in their wake” he closed in tears and compassion ran through every achaean there suddenly medon and the inspired bard approached them fresh from odysseus’ house where they had just awakened they strode into the crowds amazement took each man but the herald medon spoke in all his wisdom “hear me men of ithaca not without the hand of the deathless gods did odysseus do these things myself i saw an immortal ﬁghting at his side— like mentor to the life i saw the same god now in front of odysseus spurring him on now stampeding the suitors through the hall crazed with fear and down they went in droves” terror gripped them all their faces ashen white at last the old warrior ha litherses master’s son— who alone could see the days behind and days ahead— rose up and spoke distraught for each man there “hear me men of ithaca hear what i have to say thanks to your own craven hearts these things were done yo u n e v e r l i s t e n e d t o me or the good commander mentor you never put a stop to your sons’ senseless folly what ﬁne work they did so blind so reckless carving away the wealth affronting the wife of a great and famous man telling themselves that he’d return no more so let things rest now listen to me for once—i say don’t attack else some will draw the lightning on their necks” so he urged and some held fast to their seats but more than half sprang up with warcries now they had no taste for the prophet’s sane plan—winning eupithes quickly won them over they ran for armor and once they’d harnessed up in burnished bronze they grouped in ranks before the terraced city eupithes led them on in their foolish mad campaign certain he would avenge the slaughter of his son but the father was not destined to return— he’d meet his death in battle then and there athena at this point made appeals to zeus “father son of cronus our high and mighty king now let me ask you a question … tell me the secrets hidden in your mind will you prolong the pain the cruel ﬁghting here or hand down pacts of pe ace between both sides” “my child” zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied “why do you pry and probe me so intently come now wasn’t the plan your own y ou conceived it yourself odysseus should return and pay the traitors back do as your heart desires— but let me tell you how it should be done now that royal odysseus has taken his revenge let both sides seal their pacts that he shall reign for life and let us purge their memories of the bloody slaughter of their brothers and their sons let them be friends devoted as in the old days let peace and wealth come cresting through the land” so zeus decreed and launched athena already poised for action— down she swept from olympus’ craggy peaks by then odysseus’ men had had their ﬁll of hearty fare and the seasoned captain said “one of you go outside—see if they’re closing in” a son of dolius snapped to his command ran to the door and saw them all too close and shouted back to odysseus “they’re on top of us to arms—and fast” up they sprang and strapped themselves in armor the three men with odysseus dolius’ six sons and dolius and laertes clapped on armor too gray as they were but they would ﬁght if forced once they had all harnesse d up in burnished bronze they opened the doors and strode out odysseus in the lead and now taking the build and voice of mentor zeus’s daughter athena marched right in the good soldier odysseus thrilled to see her turned to his son and said in haste “telemachus you’ll learn soon enough—as you move up to ﬁght where champions strive to prove themselves the best— not to disgrace your father’s line a moment in battle prowess we’ve excelled for ages all across the world” telemachus reassured him “now you’ll see if you care to watch father now i’m ﬁred up disgrace you say i won’t disgrace your line” laertes called out in deep delight “what a day for me dear gods what joy— my son and my grandson vying over courage” “laertes” goddess athena rushed beside him eyes ablaze “son of arcesius dearest of all my comrades say a prayer to the brighteyed girl and father zeus then brandish your long spear and wing it fast” athena breathed enormous strength in the old man he lifted a prayer to mighty zeus’s daughter brandished his spear a moment winged it fast and hit eupithes pierced his bronzesided helmet that failed to block the bronze point tearing through— down eupithes crashed his armor clanging against his chest odysseus and his gallant son charged straight at the front lines slashing away with swords wi th twoedged spears and now they would have killed them all cut them off from home if athena daughter of storming zeus had not cried out in a piercing voice that stopped all ﬁghters cold “hold back you men of ithaca back from brutal war break off—shed no more blood—make peace at once” so athena commanded terror blanched their faces they went limp with fear weapons slipped from their hands and strewed the ground at the goddess’ ringing voice they spun in ﬂight to the city wild to save their lives but loosing a savage cry the longenduring great odysseus gathering all his force swooped like a soaring eagle— just as the son of cronus hurled a reeking bolt that fell at her feet the mighty father’s daughter and blazingeyed athena wheeled on odysseus crying “royal son of laertes odysseus master of exploits hold back now call a halt to the great leveler war— don’t court the rage of zeus who rules the world” so she commanded he obeyed her glad at heart and athena handed down her pacts of peace between both sides for all the years to come— the daughter of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder yes but the goddess still kept mentor’s build and voice
