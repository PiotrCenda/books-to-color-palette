lolita light of my life fire of my loins my sin my soul loleeta the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap at three on the teeth lo lee t a she was lo plain lo in the morning standing four feet ten in one sock she was lola in slacks she was dolly at school she was dolores on the dotted line but in my arms she was always lolita did she have a precursor she did indeed she did in point of fact there might have been no lolita at all had i not loved one summer  a certain initial girlchild in a princedom by the sea oh when about as many years before lolita was born as my age was that summer  you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style ladies and gentl emen of the jury exhibit number one is what the seraphs the misinformed  simple noblewinged seraphs envied look at this tangle of thorns i was born in  in paris my father was a gentle easygoing person a salad of racial genes a swis s citizen of mixed french and austrian descent with a dash of the danube in his veins i am going to pass around in a minute some lovely  glossyblue picturepostcards he owned a luxurious hotel on the riviera his father and two grandfathe rs had sold wine jewels and silk respectively  at thirty he married an english girl daughter of jerome dunn the alpinist and granddaughter of two dorset parsons experts in obscure subjects— paleopedology and aeolian harps respectively  my very photogenic mother died in a freak accid ent picnic lightning when i was three and save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of memory  over which if you can still stand my style i am writing under obser vation the sun of my infancy had set surely you all know those redolent remnants of day suspended with the midges about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the rambler  at the bottom of a hill in the summer dusk a furry warmth golden midges my mother ’s elder sister  sybil whom a cousin of my father ’s had married and then neglected served in my immediate family as a kind of unpaid governes s and housekeeper  somebody told me later that she had been in love with my father  and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather cleared i was extremely fond of her despite the rigidity—the fatal rigidity—of some of her rules perhaps she wanted to make of me in the fullness of time a better widower than my father  aunt sybil had pinkrimmed azure eyes and a waxen complexion she wrote poetry  she was poetically superstitious she said she knew she would die soon after my sixteenth birthday  and did her husband a great traveler in perfumes spent most of his time in america where eventually he founded a firm and acquired a bit of real estate i grew a happy  healthy child in a bright world of illustrated books clean sand orange trees friendly dogs sea vistas and smiling faces around methe splendid hotel mirana revolved as a kind of private universe a whitewashed cosmos within the blue greater one that blazed outside from the aproned potscrubber to the flanneled potentate everybody liked me everybody petted me elderly american ladies leaning on their canes listed toward me like towers of pisa ruined russian princesses who could not pay my father  bought me expensive bonbons he mon cher petit papa  took me out boating and biking taught me to swim and dive and water ski read to me don quixote and les misérables  and i adored and respected him and felt glad for him whenever i overhe ard the servants discuss his various ladyfrie nds beautiful and kind beings who made much of me and cooed and shed precious tears over my cheerful motherlessness i attended an english day school a few miles from home and there i played rackets and fives and got excellent marks and was on perfect terms with schoolmates and teachers alike the only definite sexual events that i can remember as having occurred before my thirteenth birthday that is before i first saw my little annabel were a solemn decorous and purely theoretical talk about pubertal surprises in the rose garden of the school with an american kid the son of a then celebrated motionpic ture actress whom he seldom saw in the threedimensional world and some interesting reactions on the part of my organism to certain photographs pearl and umbra with infinitely soft partings in pichon’ s sumptuous la beauté humaine that i had filched from under a mountain of marblebound graphics in the hotel library  later  in his delightful debonair manner  my father gave me all the information he thought i needed about sex this was just before sending me in the autumn of  to a lycée in lyon where we were to spend three winters but alas in the summer of that year he was touring italy with mme de r and her daughter  and i had nobody to complain to nobody to consult annabel was like the writer  of mixed parentage halfenglish halfdutch in her case i remember her features far less distinctly today than i did a few years ago before i knew lolita there are two kinds of visual memory one when you skillfu lly recreate an image in the laboratory of your mind with your eyes open and then i see annabel in such general terms as “honey colored skin” “thin arms” “brown bobbed hair” “long lashes” “big bright mouth” and the other when you instantly evoke with shut eyes on the dark innerside of your eyelids the objective absolutely optical replica of a beloved face a little ghost in natural colors and this is how i see lolita let me therefor e primly limit myself in describing annabel to saying she was a lovely child a few months my junior  her parents were old friends of my aunt’ s and as stuf fy as she they had rented a villa not far from hotel mirana bald brown mr leigh and fat powdered mrs leigh born vanessa van ness how i loathed them at first annabel and i talked of peripheral affairs she kept lifting handfuls of fine sand and letting it pour through her fingers our brains were turned the way those of intelligent european preadolescents were in our day and set and i doubt if much individual genius should be assigned to our interest in the plurality of inhabited worlds competitive tennis infinity  solipsism and so on the softness and fragility of baby animals caused us the same intense pain she wanted to be a nurse in some famished asiatic country i wanted to be a famous spy  all at once we were madly  clumsily  shamelessly  agonizingl y in love with each other hopelessly  i should add because that frenzy of mutual possession migh t have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and assimilating every particle of each other ’s soul and flesh but there we were unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an opportunity to do after one wild attempt we made to meet at night in her garden of which more later the only privacy we were allowed was to be out of earshot but not out of sight on the populous part of the plage  there on the soft sand a few feet away from our elders we would sprawl all morning in a petrified paroxysm of desire and take advanta ge of everyblessed quirk in space and time to touch each other her hand halfhidden in the sand would creep toward me its slender brown fingers sleepwalking nearer and neare r then her opalescent knee would start on a long cautious journey sometim es a chance rampart built by younger children granted us sufficient concealment to graze each other ’s salty lips these incomplete contacts drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of exasperation that not even the cold blue water  under which we still clawed at each other  could bring relief among some treasures i lost during the wanderings of my adult years there was a snapshot taken by my aunt which showed annabel her parents and the staid elderly  lame gentleman a dr cooper  who that same summer courted my aunt grouped aroun d a table in a sidewalk café annabel did not come out well caught as she was in the act of bending over her chocolat glacé  and her thin bare shoulders and the parting in her hair were about all that could be identified as i remember that picture amid the sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded but i sitting somewhat apart from the rest came out with a kind of dramatic conspic uousness a moody  beetleb rowed boy in a dark sport shirt and welltai lored white shorts his legs crossed sitting in profile looking away  that photograph was taken on the last day of our fatal summer and just a few minutes before we made our second and final attempt to thwart fate under the flimsi est of pretexts this was our very last chance and nothing really mattered we escaped from the café to the beach and found a desolate stretch of sand and there in the violet shadow of some red rocks formin g a kind of cave had a brief sessi on of avid caresses with somebody’ s lost pair of sunglasses for only witness  i was on my knees and on the point of possessing my darling when two bearded bathers the old man of the sea and his brother  came out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement and four months later she died of typhus in corfu i leaf again and again through these miserable memories and keep asking myself was it then in the glitter of that remote summer  that the rift in my life began or was my excessive desire for that child only the first evidence of an inherent singularity when i try to analyze my own cravings motives actions and so forth i surrender to a sort of retrospective imagin ation which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and refork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past i am convinced however  that in a certain magic and fateful way lolita began with annabel i also know that the shock of annabel’ s death consolidated the frustration of that nightmar e summer  made of it a permanent obstacle to any further romance throughout the cold years of my youth the spiritual and the physical had been blended in us with a perfection that must remain incomprehensible to the matter offact crude standardbrained youngsters of today  long after her death i felt her thoughts floating through mine long before we met we had had the same dreams we compare d notes we found strange affinities the same june of the same year  a stray canary had fluttered into her house and mine in two widely separated countries oh lolita had you loved me thus i have reserved for the conclusion of my “annabel” phase the account of our unsuccessful first tryst one night she managed to deceive the vicious vigilance of her family  in a nervous and slender leaved mimosa grove at the back of their villa we found a perch on the ruins of a low stone wall through the darkness and the tender trees we could see the arabesques of lighted window s which touched up by the colored inks of sensitive memory  appear to me now like playing cards—presumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy she trembled and twitched as i kissed the corner of her parted lips and the hot lobe of her ear a cluster of stars palely glowed above us between the silhouettes of long thin leaves that vibrant sky seemed as naked as she was under her light frock i saw her face in the sky strangely distinc t as if it emitted a faint radiance of its ownher legs her lovely live legs were not too close together  and when my hand located what it sought a dreamy and eerie expression halfpleasure halfpain came over those childish features she sat a little higher than i and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to kiss me her head would bend with a sleepy  soft drooping movement that was almost woeful and her bare knees caught and comp ressed my wrist and slackened again and her quivering mouth distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my face she would try to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine then my darling would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair and then again come darkly near and let me feed on her open mouth while with a generosity that was ready to offer her everything my heart my throat my entrails i gave her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion i recall the scent of some kind of toilet powder—i believe she stole it from her mother ’s spanish maid—a sweetish lowly  musky perfume it mingled with her own biscuity odor and my senses were suddenly filled to the brim  a sudden commotion in a nearby bush prevented them from overflowing—and as we drew away from each other  and with aching veins attended to what was probably a prowling cat there came from the house her mother ’s voice calling her with a rising frantic note—and dr cooper ponderously limped out into the garden but that mimosa grove—the haze of stars the tingle the flame the honeydew  and the ache remained with me and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me ever since—unt il at last twentyfour years later i broke her spell by incarnating her in another  the days of my youth as i look back on them seem to fly away from me in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car in my sanitary relations with women i was practical ironical and brisk while a college student in london and paris paid ladies sufficed me my studies were meticulous and intense although not particularly fruitful at first i planned to take a degree in psychiatry as many manqué talents do but i was even more manqué than that a peculiar exhaustion i am so oppressed doctor  set in and i switched to english literature where so many frustrated poets end as pipesmoking teachers in tweeds paris suited me i discussed soviet movies with expatriates i sat with uranists in the deux magots i published tortuous essays in obscure journals i composed pastiches … fräulein von kulp may turn her hand upon the door i will not follow her  nor fresca nor that gull a paper of mine entitled “the proustian theme in a letter from keats to benjamin bailey ” was chuckled over by the six or seven schola rs who read it i launched upon an “histoir e abrégée de la poésie anglaise” for a prominent publishing firm and then started to compile that manual of french literature for englishspeaking students with compari sons drawn from english writers which was to occupy me throughout the forties—and the last volume of which was almost ready for press by the time of my arrest i found a job—teaching english to a group of adults in auteuil then a school for boys employed me for a couple of winters now and then i took advantage of the acquaintances i had formed among social workers and psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions such as orphanages and reform schools where pale pubescent girls with mattedeyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted one in dreams now i wish to introduce the following idea between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who to certain bewitched travelers twice or many times older than they reveal their true nature which is not human but nymphic that is demoniac and these chosen creatures i propose to designate as “nymphets” it will be marked that i substitute time terms for spatial ones in fact i would have the reader see “nine” and “fourteen” as the boun daries—the mirrory beaches and rosy rocks—of an enchanted island haunted by those nymphets of mine and surround ed by a vast misty sea between those age limits are all girlchildren nymphets of course not otherwise we who are in the know  we lone voyagers we nympholepts would have long gone insane neither are good looks any criterion and vulgarity  or at least what a given commun ity terms so does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics the fey grace the elusive shifty  soulshattering insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where lolita plays with her likes within the same age limits the number of true nymphets is strikingly inferior to that of provisionally plain or just nice or “cute” or even “sweet” and “attractive” ordinary  plumpish formless cold skinned essentia lly human little girls with tummies and pigtails who may or may not turn into adults of great beauty look at the ugly dumplings in black stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into stunning stars of the screen a normal man given a group photograph of school girls or girl scouts and asked to point out the comeliest one will not necessarily choose the nymphet among them you have to be an artist and a madman a creature of infinite melancholy  with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a super voluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle spine oh how you have to cringe and hide in order to discern at once by ineffable signs—the slightly feline outline of a cheekbone the slenderness of a downy limb and other indices which despair and shame and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate—the little deadly demon among the wholesome children she stands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power furthermore since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the matter  the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a gap of several years never less than ten i should say generally thirty or forty  and as many as ninety in a few known cases between maiden and man to enable the latter to come under a nymphet’ s spell it is a question of focal adjustment of a certain distance that the inner eye thrills to surmount and a certain contrast that the mind perceives with a gasp of perverse delight when i was a child and she was a child my little annabel was no nymphet to me i was her equal a faunlet in my own right on that same enchanted island of time but today  in september  after twentynine years have elapsed i think i can distinguish in her the initial fateful elf in my life we loved each other with a premature love marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives i was a strong lad and survived but the poison was in the wound and the wound remained ever open and soon i found myself maturing amid a civilization which allows a man of twentyfiv e to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve no wonder  then that my adult life during the european period of my existence proved monstrously twofold overtly  i had socalled normal relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins or pears for breasts inly i was consumed by a hell furnace of locali zed lust for every passing nymphet whom as a lawabiding poltroon i never dared approach the human females i was allowed to wield were but palliative agents i am ready to believe that the sensations i derived from natural fornication were much the same as those known to normal big males consorting with their normal big mates in that routine rhythm which shakes the world the trouble was that those gentlemen had not and i had caught glimpses of an incomparably more poignant bliss the dimm est of my pollutive dreams was a thousan d times more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of genius or the most talented impotent might imagine my world was split i was aware of not one but two sexes neither of which was mine both would be termed female by the anatomist but to me through the prism of my senses “they were as different as mist and mast” all this i rationalize now in my twenties and early thirties i did not understand my throes quite so clearly  while my body knew what it craved for my mind rejected my body’ s every plea one moment i was ashamed and frightened another recklessly optimistic taboos strangulated me psychoanalysts wooed me with pseudoliberations of pseudolibidoes thefact that to me the only objects of amorous tremor were sisters of annabel’ s her handmaids and girlpages appeared to me at times as a forerunner of insanity  at other times i would tell myself that it was all a question of attitude that there was really nothing wrong in being moved to distraction by girlchildren let me remind my reader that in england with the passage of the children and young person act in  the term “girl child” is defined as “a girl who is over eight but under fourteen years” after that from fourteen to seventeen the statutory definition is “young person” in massachusetts us on the other hand a “wayward child” is technically  one “between seven and seventeen years of age” who moreover  habitually associates with vicious or immoral persons hugh broughton a writer of controv ersy in the reign of james the first has proved

on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a trembling book around the quiet scholar  nymphets played freely  as if he were a familiar statue or part of an old tree’s shadow and sheen once a perfect little beauty in a tartan frock with a clatter put her heavily armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into me and tighten the strap of her roller skate and i dissolved in the sun with my book for fig leaf as her aubu rn ringlets fell all over her skinned knee and the shadow of leaves i shared pulsated and melted on her radiant limb next to my chameleonic cheek another time a redhaired school girl hung over me in the métro and a revelation of axillary russet i obtained remained in my blood for weeks  i could list a great number of these onesided diminutive romances some of them ended in a rich flavor of hell it happened for instance that from my balcony i would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of undressing before a co operative mirror  thus isolate d thus removed the vision acquired an especially keen charm that made me race with all speed toward my lone gratification but abruptly  fiendishly  the tender pattern of nudity i had adored would be transformed into the disgusting lamplit bare arm of a man in his underclothes reading his paper by the open window in the hot damp hopeless summer night ropeskipping hopscotch that old woman in black who sat down next to me on my bench on my rack of joy a nymphet was groping under me for a lost marble and asked if i had stomachache the insole nt hag ah leave me alone in my pubescent park in my mossy garden let them play around me forever  never grow up a propos i have often wondered what became of those nymphets later in this wroughtiron world of crisscross cause and effect could it be that the hidden throb i stole from them did not affect their future i had possessed her—and she never knew it all right but would it not tell sometime later had i not somehow tampered with her fate by involving her image in my voluptas oh it was and remains a source of great and terrible wonder  i learned however  what they looked like those lovely  maddening thin armed nymphet s when they grew up i remember walking along an animated street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the madeleine a short slim girl passed me at a rapid highheeled tripping step we glanced back at the same moment she stopped and i accosted her  she came hardly up to my chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round little face french girls so often have and i liked her long lashes and tightfitting tailored dress sheathing in pearlgray her young body which still retained— and that was the nymphic echo the chill of delight the leap in my loins—a childish somethi ng mingling with the professional frétillement of her small agile rump i asked her price and she promptly replied with melodious silvery precision a bird a very bird “cent ” i tried to haggle but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes directed so far down at her round forehead and rudimentary hat a band a posy and with one beat of her lashes “tant pis ” she said and made as if to move away  perhaps only three years earlier i might have seen her coming home from school that evocation settled the matter  she led me up the usual steep stairs with the usual bell clearing the way for the monsieur who might not care to meet another monsieur  on the mournf ul climb to the abject room all bed and bidet  as usual she asked at once for her petit cadeau  and as usual i asked her name monique and her age eighteen i was pretty well acquainted with the banal way of streetwalkers they all answer “dixhuit ”—a trim twitter  a note of finality and wistful deceit which they emit up to ten times per day the poor little creatures but in monique’ s case there could be no doubt she was if anything adding one or two years to her age this ideduced from many details of her compact neat curiously immature body  having shed her clothes with fascinating rapidity  she stood for a moment partly wrapped in the dingy gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasur e as pat as pat could be to an organgrinder in the dust brimming courtyard below  whe n i examined her small hands and drew her attention to their grubby fingernails she said with a naïve frown “oui ce n’est pas bien” and went to the washbasin but i said it did not matter  did not matter at all with her brown bobbed hair luminous gray eyes and pale skin she looked perfectly charming her hips were no bigger than those of a squatting lad in fact i do not hesitate to say and indeed this is the reason why i linger gratefully in that gauzegray room of memory with little monique that among the eighty or so grues i had had operate upon me she was the only one that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure “il était malin celui qui a inven té ce truclà ” she comment ed amiably  and got back into her clothes with the same highstyle speed i asked for another more elaborate assignment later the same evening and she said she would meet me at the corner café at nine and swore she had never posé un lapin in all her young life w e returned to the same room and i could not help saying how very pretty she was to which she answered demurely “tu es bien genti l de dire ça” and then noticing what i noticed too in the mirror reflecting our small eden—the dreadful grimace of clenchedteeth tenderness that distorted my mouth—dutiful little monique oh she had been a nymphet all right wanted to know if she should remove the layer of red from her lips avant qu’on se couche in case i planned to kiss her of course i planned it i let myself go with her more completely than i had with any young lady before and my last vision that night of longlas hed monique is touched up with a gaiety that i find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating sordid taciturn love life she looked tremend ously pleased with the bonus of fifty i gave her as she trotted out into the april night drizzle with humbert humbert lumbering in her narrow wake stopping before a window display she said with great gusto “je vais m’acheter des bas” and never may i forget the way her parisian childish lips exploded on “bas” pronouncing it with an appetite that all but changed the “a” into a brief buoyant bursting “o” as in “ bot” i had a date with her next day at  pm in my own rooms but it was less successful she seemed to have grown less juvenile more of a woman overnight a cold i caught from her led me to cancel a fourth assignmentnor was i sorry to break an emotional series that threatened to burden me with heartrending fantasies and peter out in dull disappointmen t so let her remain sleek slender monique as she was for a minute or two a delinquent nymphet shining through the matter offact young whore my brief acquai ntance with her started a train of thought that may seem pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes an advertisement in a lewd magazine landed me one brave day in the office of a mlle edith who began by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a collection of rather formal photographs in a rather soiled album “regar dezmoi cette belle brune ” whe n i pushed the album away and somehow managed to blurt out my criminal craving she looked as if about to show me the door however  after asking me what price i was prepared to disburse she condescended to put me in touch with a person qui pourrait arranger la chose  next day an asthmatic woman  coarsely painted garrulous garlicky  with an almost farcical proven çal accent and a black mustac he above a purple lip took me to what was apparently her own domicile  and there after explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise she theatrically drew aside a curtain to reveal what i judged was that part of the room where a large and unfastidious family usually slept it was now empty save for a monstrously plump sallow  repulsively plain girl of at least fifteen with redribboned thick black braids who sat on a chair perfunctorily nursing a bald doll when i shook my head and tried to shuffle out of the trap the woman talking fast began removing the dingy woolen jersey from the young giantess’ torso then seeing my determination to leave she demanded son argent a door at the end of the room was opened and two men who had been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble they were misshapen barenecked very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses a small boy and a begrimed bowlegged toddler lurked behind them with the insolent logic of a nightmare the enraged procuress indicating the man in glasses said he had served in the police  lui so that i had better do as i was told i went up to marie—for that was her stellar name—who by then had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool at the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the doll with a surge of pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture i thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand she surrendered my gift to the exdetective whereupon i was suffered to leave i do not know if the pimp’ s album may not have been another link in the daisychain but soon after for my own safety  i decided to marry  it occurred to me that regular hours homecooked meals all the conventions of marriage the prophylactic routine of its bedroom activities and who knows the eventual flowering of certain moral values of certain spiritual substitutes might help me if not to purge myself of my degrading and dangerous desires at least to keep them under pacific control a little money that had come my way after my father ’s death nothing very grand— the mirana had been sold long before in addition to my striking if somewhat brutal good looks allowed me to enter upon my quest with equanimity  after considerable deliberation my choice fell on the daughter of a polish doctor the good man happened to be treating me for spells of dizziness and tachycardia we played chess his daughter watched me from behind her easel  and inserted eyes or knuckles borrowed from me into the cubistic trash that accomplished misses then painted instead of lilacs and lambs let me repeat with quiet force i was and still am despite mes malheurs  an exceptionally handsome male slowmoving tall with soft dark hair and a gloomy but all the more seductive cast of demeanor  exceptional virility often reflects in the subject’ s displayable features a sullen and conge sted something that pertains to what he has to conceal and this was my case well did i know  alas that i could obtain at the snap of my fingers any adult female i chose in fact it had become quite a habit with me of not being too attentive to women lest they come toppling bloodripe into my cold lap had i been a français moyen with a taste for flashy ladies i might have easily found among the many crazed beauties that lashed my grim rock creatures far more fascinating than valeria my choice however  was prompted by considerations whose essence was as i realized too late a piteous compromise all of which goes to show how dreadfully stupid poor humbert always was in matters of sex although i told myself i was looking merely for a soothing presence a glorified potaufeu  an animated merkin what really attracted me to valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl she gave it not because she had divined something abou t me it was just her style—and i fell for it actually  she was at least in her late twenties i never established her exact age for even her passport lied and had mislaid her virginity under circumstances that changed with her reminiscent moods i on my part was as naïve as only a pervert can be she looked fluffy and frolicso me dressed à la gamine  showed a gene rous amount of smooth leg knew how to stress the white of a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper  and pouted and dimpled and romped and dirndled and shook her short curly blond hair in the cutest and tritest fashion imaginable after a brief ceremony at the mairie  i took her to the new apartment i had rented and somewhat to her surprise had her wear  before i touched her a girl’s plain nightshirt that i had managed to filch from the linen closet of an orphanage  i derived some fun from that nuptial night and had the idiot in hysteric s by sunrise but reality soon asserted itself the bleached curl revealed its melanic root the down turned to prickles on a shaved shin the mobile moist mouth no matter how i stuffed it with love disclosed ignominiously its resemblance to the corresponding part in a treasured portrait of her toadlike dead mama and presently  instead of a pale little gutter girl humbert humbert had on his hands a large puffy shortlegged bigbreasted and practically brainless baba  this state of af fairs lasted from  to  her only asset was a muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of comfort in our small squalid flat two rooms a hazy view in one window  a brick wall in the other  a tiny kitchen a shoeshaped bath tub within which i felt like marat but with no whitenecked maid en to stab me we had quite a few cozy evenings togethe r she deep in her parissoir  i work ing at a rickety table we went to movies bicycle races and boxing matches i appealed to her stale flesh very seldom only in cases of great urgency and despair  thegrocer opposite had a little daug hter whose shadow drove me mad but with valeria’ s help i did find after all some legal outlets to my fantastic predicament as to cooking we tacitly dismissed the potaufeu and had most of our meals at a crowded place in rue bonaparte where there were wine stains on the table cloth and a good deal of foreign babbl e and next door an art dealer displayed in his cluttered window a splendid flamboyant green red golden and inky blue ancient american estampe—a locomotive with a gigantic smokestack great baroque lamps and a tremendous cowcatcher  hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and mixing a lot of sparkstudded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds these burst in the summer of  mon oncle d’amérique died bequeathing me an annual incom e of a few thousand dollars on condition i came to live in the states and showed some interest in his business this prospect was most welcome to me i felt my life needed a shakeup there was another thing too moth holes had appeared in the plush of matrimonial comfort during the last weeks i had kept noticing that my fat valeria was not her usual self had acqu ired a queer restlessness even showed something like irritation at times which was quite out of keeping with the stock character she was suppose d to impersonate when i informed her we were shortly to sail for new york she looked distressed and bewildered there were some tedious difficulties with her papers she had a nansen or better say nonsense passport which for some reason a share in her husband’ s solid swiss citizenshi p could not easily transcend and i decided it was the necessity of queuing in the préfectur e and other formalities that had made her so listless despite my patiently describing to her america the country of rosy children and great trees where life would be such an improvement on dull dingy paris we were coming out of some office building one morning with her papers almost in order  when valeria as she waddled by my side began to shake her poodle head vigorously without saying a word i let her go on for a while and then asked if she thought she had something inside she answered i translate from her french which was i imagine a translation in its turn of some slavic platitude “there is another man in my life” now  these are ugly words for a husband to hear they dazed me i confess to beat her up in the street there and then as an honest vulgarian might have done  was not feasib le years of secret sufferings had taught mesuperhuman selfcontrol so i ushered her into a taxi which had been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time and in this comparative privacy i quietly suggested she comment her wild talk a mounting fury was suffocating me—not because i had any particular fondness for that figure of fun mme humbert  but because matters of legal and illegal conjunction were for me alone to decide and here she was valeria the comedy wife brazenly preparing to dispose in her own way of my comfort and fate i demanded her lover ’s name i repeated my question but she kept up a burlesque babble discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing plans for an immedi ate divorce “mais qui estce ” i shou ted at last striking her on the knee with my fist and she without even wincing stared at me as if the answer were too simple for words then gave a quick shrug and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver  he pulled up at a small café and introduced hims elf i do not remember his ridiculous name but after all those years i still see him quite clearly—a stocky white russian excolonel with a bushy mustache and a crew cut there were thousands of them plying that fool’s trade in paris we sat down at a table the tsarist ordered wine and valeria after applying a wet napkin to her knee went on talking— into me rather than to me she poured words into this dignified receptacle with a volubility i had never suspected she had in her and every now and then she would volley a burst of slavic at her stolid lover  the situation was preposterous and became even more so when the taxicolonel stopping valeria with a possessive smile began to unfold his views and plans with an atrocious accent to his careful french he delineated the world of love and work into which he proposed to enter hand in hand with his childwife valeria she by now was preen ing herself between him and me rouging her pursed lips tripling her chin to pick at her blousebosom and so forth and he spoke of her as if she were absent and also as if she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being transferred for her own good from one wise guardian to another even wiser one and although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured certain impressions i can swear that he actually consulted me on such things as her diet her periods her wardrobe and the books she had read or should read “i think” he said “she will like jean christophe ” oh he was quite a scholar  mr taxovich i put an end to this gibberish by suggesting valeria pack up her few belongings immediately  upon which the platitudinous colon el gallantlyoffered to carry them into the car reverting to his professional state he drove the humb erts to their residence and all the way valeria talked and humbert the terrible deliberated with humbert the small whether humbert humbert should kill her or her lover  or both or neither  i remember once handling an automatic belonging to a fellow student in the days i have not spoken of them i think but never mind when i toyed with the idea of enjoying his little sister  a most diaphanous nymphet with a black hair bow and then shooting myself i now wondered if valechka as the colonel called her was really worth shooting or strangling or drowni ng she had very vulnerable legs and i decided i would limit myself to hurting her very horribly as soon as we were alone but we never were valechka—by now shedding torrents of tears tinged with the mess of her rainbow makeup—started to fill anyhow a trunk and two suitcases and a bursting carton and visions of putting on my mountain boots and taking a running kick at her rump were of course impossible to put into executi on with the cursed colonel hovering around all the time i cannot say he behaved insolentl y or anything like that on the contrary  he displayed as a small sideshow in the theatricals i had been inveigled in a discreet oldworld civility  punctuating his movements with all sorts of mispronounced apologies j’ai demannde pardonne —excuse me— estce que j’ai puis—may i—and so forth and turning away tactfully when valechka took down with a flourish her pink panties from the clothesline above the tub but he seemed to be all over the place at once  le gredin agreeing his frame with the anatomy of the flat reading in my chair my newspaper  untying a knotted string rolling a cigarette counting the teaspoons visiting the bathroom  helping his moll to wrap up the electric fan her father had given her and carrying streetward her luggage i sat with arms folded one hip on the wind ow sill dying of hate and boredom at last both were out of the quivering apartment—the vibration of the door i had slammed after them still rang in my every nerve a poor substitute for the backhand slap with which i ought to have hit her across the cheekbone according to the rules of the movies clumsily playing my part i stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my english toilet water they had not but i notice d with a spasm of fierce disgust that the forme r counselor of the tsar after thoroughly easing his bladder  had not flushed the toilet that solemn pool of alien urine with a soggy  tawny cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a crowning insult and i wildly lookedaround for a weapon actually i daresay it was nothing but middleclass russian courtes y with an oriental tang perhaps that had prompted the good colonel maximovich his name suddenly taxies back to me a very formal person as they all are to muffle his private need in decorous silence so as not to underscore the small size of his host’ s domicile with the rush of a gross cascade on top of his own hushed trickle but this did not enter my mind at the moment as groaning with rage i ransacked the kitchen for something better than a broom then canceling my search i dashed out of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him barefisted despite my natural vigor  i am no pugili st while the short but broad shouldered maximovich seemed made of pig iron the void of the street revealing nothing of my wife’ s departure except a rhinestone button that she had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three unnecessary years in a broken box may have spared me a bloody nose but no matte r i had my little revenge in due time a man from pasadena told me one day that mrs maximovich née zborovski had died in childbirth around  the couple had somehow got over to california and had been used there for an excellent salary  in a yearlong experiment conducted by a distinguished american ethnologist the experiment dealt with human and racial reactions to a diet of bananas and dates in a constant position on all fours my informant a doctor  swore he had seen with his own eyes obese valechka and her colonel by then grayhaired and also quite corpulent diligently crawling about the wellswept floors of a brightly lit set of rooms fruit in one water in another  mats in a third and so on in the company of several other hired quadrupeds selected from indigent and helpless groups i tried to find the results of these tests in the review of anthr opology  but they appear not to have been published yet these scientific products take of course some time to fructuate i hope they will be illustrated with good photographs when they do get printed although it is not very likely that a prison library will harbor such erudite works the one to which i am restricted these days despite my lawyer ’s favors is a good example of the inane eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison libraries they have the bible of course and dickens an ancient set n y g w dillingham publisher  mdccclxxxvii and the childr en’s encyclopedia

globe when after a winter of ennui and pneumonia in portugal i at last reached the states in new york i eagerly accepted the soft job fate offered me it consisted mainly of thinking up and editing perfume ads i welcomed its desultory character and pseudoliterary aspects attending to it whenever i had nothing better to do on the other hand i was urged by a wartime university in new york to complete my comparative history of french literature for englishspeaking students the first volume took me a couple of years during which i put in seldom less than fifteen hours of work daily  as i look back on those days i see them divided tidily into ample light and narrow shade the light pertaining to the solace of research in palatial libraries the shade to my excruciating desires and insomnias of which enough has been said knowing me by now the reader can easily imagine how dusty and hot i got trying to catch a glimpse of nymphets alas always remote playing in central park and how repulsed i was by the glitter of deodorized career girls that a gay dog in one of the offices kept unloading upon me let us skip all that a dreadful breakdown sent me to a sanatori um for more than a year i went back to my work—only to be hospitalized again robust outdoor life seemed to promise me some relief one of my favorite doctors a charming cynical chap with a little brown beard had a brother  and this brother was about to lead an expedition into arctic canada i was attached to it as a “recor der of psychic reactions” with two young botanists and an old carpenter i shared now and then never very successfully the favors of one of our nutritionists a dr anita johnson— who was soon flown back i am glad to say i had little notion of what object the expedition was pursuing judging by the number of meteorologists upon it we may have been tracking to its lair somewhere on princ e of wales’ island i understand the wandering and wobbly north magnetic pole one group jointl y with the canadians established a weather station on pierre point in melville sound another group equallymisguided collected plankton a third studied tuberculosis in the tundra bert a film photographer—an insecure fellow with whom at one time i was made to partake in a good deal of menial work he too had some psychic troubles—maintained that the big men on our team the real leaders we never saw were mainly engaged in checking the influence of climatic amelioration on the coats of the arctic fox we lived in prefabricated timber cabins amid a precambrian world of granite we had heaps of supplies—the reader ’s digest  an ice cream mixer  chemical toilets paper caps for christmas my health improved wonderfully in spite or because of all the fantastic blankness and boredom surrounded by such dejected vegetation as willow scrub and lichens permeated and i suppose clean sed by a whistling gale seated on a boulder under a comple tely translucent sky through which however  nothing of importance showed i felt curiously aloof from my own self no temptations maddened me the plump glossy little eskimo girls with their fish smell hideo us raven hair and guinea pig faces evoked even less desire in me than dr  johnson had nymphets do not occur in polar regions i left my betters the task of analyzing glacial drifts drumlins and gremlins and kremlins and for a time tried to jot down what i fondly thought were “reactions” i noticed for instance that dreams under the midnight sun tended to be highly colored and this my friend the photographer confirmed i was also supposed to quiz my various companions on a number of important matters such as nostal gia fear of unknown anima ls foodfantasies nocturnal emissions hobbie s choice of radio programs changes in outlook and so forth everybody got so fed up with this that i soon dropped the project completely  and only toward the end of my twenty months of cold labor as one of the botanists jocosely put it conco cted a perfectly spurious and very racy report that the reader will find published in the annals of adult psychophysics for  or  as well as in the issue of arctic explorations devoted to that particular expedition which in conclusion was not really concerned with victoria island copper or anything like that as i learned later from my genial doctor for the nature of its real purpose was what is termed “hushhush” and so let me add merely that whatever it was that purpose was admirably achieved the reader will regret to learn that soon after my return to civilization i had another bout with insanity if to melancholia and a sense of insuf ferable oppression that cruel term must be applied i owe my complete restorationto a discovery i made while being treated at that particular very expensive sanatorium i discovered there was an endless source of robust enjoyment in trifling with psychiatrists cunn ingly leading them on never letting them see that you know all the tricks of the trade inventing for them elaborate dreams pure classics in style which make them  the dreamextortionists dream and wake up shrieking teasing them with fake “primal scenes” and never allowing them the slightest glimpse of one’s real sexual predicament by bribing a nurse i won acces s to some files and discovered with glee cards calling me “potentially homosexual” and “totally impotent” the sport was so excellent its results—in my case—s o ruddy that i stayed on for a whole month after i was quite well sleeping admirably and eating like a schoolgirl and then i added another week just for the pleasu re of taking on a powerful newcomer  a displaced and surely  deranged celebrity  known for his knack of making patients believe they had witnessed their own conception  upon signing out i cast around for some place in the new england countryside or sleepy small town elms white church where i could spend a studio us summer subsisting on a compact boxful of notes i had accumulated and bathing in some nearby lake my work had begun to interest me again—i mean my scholarly exertions the other thing my active participat ion in my uncle’ s posthumous perfumes had by then been cut down to a minimum one of his former employees  the scion of a distinguished family  suggested i spend a few months in the residence of his impoverished cousins a mr mccoo retired and his wife who wanted to let their upper story where a late aunt had delicately dwelt he said they had two little daughters one a baby  the other a girl of twelve and a beautiful garden not far from a beautiful lake and i said it sounded perfectly perfect i exchanged letters with these people satisfying them i was housebroken and spent a fantastic night on the train imagining in all possible detail the enigmatic nymphet i would coach in french and fondle in humbertish nobody met me at the toy station where i alighted with my new expensive bag and nobody answered the telephone eventually  however  a distraught mccoo in wet clothes turned up at the only hotel of greenandpink ramsdale with the news that his house had just burned down—possibly  owing to the synchronous conflagration that had been raging all night in my veins his family  he said had fled to a farm he owned and had taken the car but a friend of his wife’ s a grand person mrs haze of  lawn street offered to accommodate me a lady who lived opposite mrs haze’ s had lent mccoo her limousine a marvelously oldfashioned squaretopped affair manned by a cheerful negro now  since the only reason for my coming at all had vanished the aforesaid arrangement seemed preposterous all right his house would have to be completely rebuilt so what had he not insured it sufficiently i was angry  disappointed and bored but being a polite european could not refuse to be sent off to lawn street in that funeral car feeling that otherwise mccoo would devise an even moreelaborate means of getting rid of me i saw him scamper away and my chauf feur shook his head with a soft chuckle en route i swore to myself i would not dream of staying in ramsdale under any circumstance but would fly that very day to the bermudas or the bahamas or the blazes possibilities of sweetness on technicolor beaches had been trickling through my spine for some time before and mccoo’ s cousin had in fact sharply diverted that train of thought with his wellmeaning but as it transpired now absolutely inane suggestion speaking of sharp turns we almost ran over a meddlesome suburban dog one of those who lie in wait for cars as we swerved into lawn street a little further the haze house a whiteframe horror  appeared looking dingy and old more gray than white—the kind of place you know will have a rubber tube affixable to the tub faucet in lieu of shower  i tipped the chauf feur and hoped he would immediately drive away so that i might double back unnoticed to my hotel and bag but the man merely crossed to the other side of the street where an old lady was calling to him from her porch what could i do i pressed the bell button a colore d maid let me in—and left me standing on the mat while she rushed back to the kitchen where something was burning that ought not to burn the front hall was graced with door chimes a whiteeyed wooden thingamabob of commercial mexican origin and that banal darling of the arty middle class van gogh’ s “arlésienne” a door ajar to the right afforded a glimpse of a living room with some more mexican trash in a corner cabinet and a striped sofa along the wall there was a staircase at the end of the hallw ay and as i stood mopping my brow only now did i realize how hot it had been outofdoors and staring to stare at something at an old gray tennis ball that lay on an oak chest there came from the upper landing the contralto voice of mrs haze who leaning over the banisters inquired melodi ously  “is that monsieur humbert” a bit of cigarette ash dropped from there in addition presently  the lady herself—sandals maroon slacks yellow silk blouse squarish face in that order—came down the steps her index finger still tapping upon her cigarette i think i had better describe her right away  to get it over with the poor lady was in her middle thirties she had a shiny forehead plucke d eyebrows and quite simple but not unattra ctive features of a type that may be defined as a weak soluti on of marlene dietric h patting her bronzebrown bun sheled me into the parlor and we talked for a minute about the mccoo fire and the privilege of living in ramsdale her very wideset seagreen eyes had a funny way of traveling all over you carefully avoiding your own eyes her smile was but a quizzical jerk of one eyebrow and uncoiling herself from the sofa as she talked she kept making spasmodic dashes at three ashtrays and the near fender where lay the brown core of an apple whereupon she would sink back again one leg folded under her she was obvio usly one of those women whose polished words may reflect a book club or bridge club or any other deadly conventionality  but never her soul wom en who are completely devoid of humor women utterly indif ferent at heart to the dozen or so possible subjects of a parlor conversation but very particular about the rules of such conversations through the sunny cellophane of which not very appetizing frustrations can be readily distinguished i was perfectly aware that if by any wild chance i became her lodger  she would methodically proceed to do in regard to me what taking a lodger probably meant to her all along and i would again be enmeshed in one of those tedious af fairs i knew so well but there was no question of my settling there i could not be happy in that type of household with bedraggled magazines on every chair and a kind of horrible hybridization between the comedy of socalled “functional modern furniture” and the tragedy of decrepit rockers and rickety lamp tables with dead lamps i was led upstairs and to the left—into “my” room i inspected it through the mist of my utter rejection of it but i did discern above “my” bed rené prinet’ s “kreutzer sonata” and she called that servant maid’s room a “semistudio” let’s get out of here at once i firmly said to myself as i pretended to deliberate over the absurdly  and ominously  low price that my wistful hostess was asking for board and bed oldworld polite ness however  obliged me to go on with the ordeal we crossed the landing to the right side of the house where “i and lo have our rooms”—lo being presumably the maid and the lodger lover could hardly conceal a shudder when he a very fastidious male was granted a preview of the only bathroom a tiny oblong between the landing and “lo’s” room with limp wet things overhanging the dubious tub the question mark of a hair inside and there were the expected coils of the rubber snake and its complement—a pinkish cozy  coyly covering the toilet lid “i see you are not too favorably impressed” said the lady letting her hand rest for a moment upon my sleeve she combined a cool forwa rdness—theoverflow of what i think is calle d “poise”—with a shyness and sadness that caused her detached way of selecting her words to seem as unnatural as the intonation of a professor of “speech” “this is not a neat household i confess” the doomed dear continued “but i assure you she looked at my lips you will be very comfortable very comfortable indeed let me show you the garden” the last more brightly  with a kind of winsome toss of the voice reluctantly i followed her downstairs again then through the kitchen at the end of the hall on the right side of the house—the side where also the dining room and the parlor were under “my” room on the left there was nothing but a garage in the kitchen the negro maid a plum p youngish woman said as she took her large glossy black purse from the knob of the door leading to the back porch “i’ll go now mrs haze” “yes louise” answered mrs haze with a sigh “i’ll settle with you friday ” we passed on to a small pantry and entered the dining room parallel to the parlor we had already admired i noticed a white sock on the floor  with a deprecatory grunt mrs haze stooped without stopping and threw it into a closet next to the pantry  we cursorily inspected a mahogany table with a fruit vase in the middle containing nothing but the still glistening stone of one plum i groped for the timetable i had in my pocket and surreptitiously fished it out to look as soon as possible for a train i was still walking behind mrs haze through the dining room when  beyond it there came a sudden burst of greenery—“the piazza” sang out my leader  and then without the least warning a blue seawave swelled under my heart and from a mat in a pool of sun halfnaked kneeling turning about on her knees there was my riviera love peering at me over dark glasses it was the same child—the same frail honeyhued shoulders the same silky supple bare back the same chestnut head of hair a polkadotted black kerchief tied around her chest hid from my aging ape eyes but not from the gaze of young memory  the juvenile breasts i had fondled one immortal day and as if i were the fairytale nurse of some little princess lost kidnaped discovered in gypsy rags throug h which her nakedness smiled at the king and his hounds  i recognized the tiny darkbrown mole on her side with awe and delight the king crying for joy the trumpets blaring the nurse drunk i saw again her lovely indrawn abdomen where my southbound mouth had briefly paused and those puerile hips on which i had kissed the crenulated imprint left by the band of her shorts—that last mad immortalday behind the “roches roses” the twentyfive years i had lived since then tapered to a palpitating point and vanished i find it most difficult to express with adequate force that flash that shiver  that impact of passionate recognition in the course of the sunshot moment that my glance slithered over the kneeling child her eyes blinking over those stern dark spectacles—the little herr doktor who was to cure me of all my aches while i passed by her in my adult disguise a great big handsome hunk of movieland manhood the vacuum of my soul managed to suck in every detail of her bright beauty  and these i checked against the features of my dead bride a little later of course she this nouvelle  this lolita my lolita was to eclipse completely her prototype all i want to stress is that my discovery of her was a fatal consequence of that “princedom by the sea” in my tortured past everything betw een the two events was but a series of gropings and blunders and false rudiments of joy everything they shared made one of them i have no illusions however  my judges will regard all this as a piece of mummery on the part of a madman with a gross liking for the fruit vert au fond ça m’est bien égal all i know is that while the haze woman and i went down the steps into the breathless garden my knees were like reflections of knees in rippling water  and my lips were like sand and— “that was my lo” she said “and these are my lilies” “yes” i said “yes they are beautiful beautiful beautiful”  exhibit number two is a pocket diary bound in black imitation leather  with a golden year   en escalier  in its upper lefthand corner  i speak of this neat product of the blank blank co blankton mass as if it were really before me actu ally it was destroyed five years ago and what we examine now by courtesy of a photographic memory is but its brief materialization a puny unfledged phœnix i remember the thing so exactly because i wrote it really twice first i jotted down each entry in penc il with many erasures and corrections on the leaves of what is commercially known as a “typewriter tablet” then i copied it out with obvious abbreviations in my smallest most satanic hand in the little black book just mentioned may  is a fast day by proclamation in new hampshire but not in the carolinas that day an epidemic of “abdominal

the most secret and sensitive chord of my abject body after a while she sat down next to me on the lower step of the back porch and began to pick up the pebbles between her feet—pebbles my god then a

might prevent me from making my entrée with any semblance of casualness sunday  heat ripple still with us a most favonian week this time i took up a strategic position with obese newspaper and new pipe in the piazza rocker befor e l arrived to my intense disappointment she came with her mother  both in twopiece bathing suits black as new as my pipe my darling my sweetheart stood for a moment near me—wanted the funnies— and she smelt almost exactly like the other one the riviera one but more intensely so with rougher overtones—a torrid odor that at once set my manhood astir— but she had already yanked out of me the coveted section and retreated to her mat near her phocine mamma there my beauty lay down on her stomach showing me showing the thousand eyes wide open in my eyed blood her slightly raised shoulder blades and the bloom alongthe incurvation of her spine and the swellings of her tense narrow nates clothed in black and the seaside of her schoolgirl thighs silently  the seventhgrader enjoyed her greenredblue comics she was the loveliest nymphet greenredblue priap himself could think up as i looked on through prismat ic layers of light drylipped focusing my lust and rocking slightly under my newspaper  i felt that my perception of her if properly concentrated upon might be sufficient to have me attain a beggar ’s bliss immediately but like some predator that prefers a moving prey to a motionless one i planned to have this pitiful attainment coincide with one of the various girlish movements she made now and then as she read such as trying to scrat ch the middle of her back and revealing a stippled armpit— but fat haze suddenly spoiled everything by turning to me and asking me for a light and starting a makebelieve conversation about a fake book by some popular fraud monday  delectatio morosa i spend my doleful days in dumps and dolors we mother haze dolor es and i were to go to our glass lake this afternoon and bathe and bask but a nacreous

speck of something checked frock although i do love that intoxicating brown fragrance of hers i really think she should wash her hair once in a while for a moment we were both in the same warm green bath of the mirror that reflected the top of a poplar with us in the sky held her roughly by the shoulders then tenderly by the temples and turned her about “it’sright there” she said “i can feel it” “swiss peasant would use the tip of her tongue” “lick it out” “yeth shly try” “sure” she said gently i pressed my quivering sting along her rolling salty eyeball “goodygood y” she said nictating “it

somber humbert pressed his mouth to her fluttering eyelid she laughed and brushed past me out of the room my heart seemed everywhere at once never in my life—not even when fondling my childlove in

nymphets damn it if i close my eyes i see but an immobilized fraction of her a cinematographic still a sudden smooth nether loveliness as with one knee up under her tartan skirt she sits tying her

feminine novel what drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphet—of every nymphet perhaps this mixture in my lolita of tender dreamy childishnes s and a kind of eerie vulgarity  stemming from the snubnosed cuteness of ads and magazine pictur es from the blurry pinkness of adolescent maidservants in the old country smelling of crushed daisies and sweat and from very young harlots disguised as children in provincial brothels and then again all this gets mixed up with the exquisite stainless tenderness seeping through the musk and the mud through the dirt and the death oh god oh god and what is most singular is that she this lolita my lolita hasindividualized the writer ’s ancient lust so that above and over everything there is—lolita wednesday  “look make mother take you and me to our glass lake tomorrow ” these were the textual words said to me by my twelveyear old flame in a voluptuous whisper  as we happened to bump into one another on the front porch i out she in the

the clapboard wall of the house two poplars shivered and shook you could make out the formless sounds of remote traffic a child calling “nancy  nancy” in the house lolita had put on her favorite “little carmen” record which i used to call “dwarf conductors” making her snort with mock derision at my mock wit thursday  last night we sat on the piazza the haze woman lolita and i warm dusk had deepened into amorous darkness the old girl had finished relating in great detail the plot of a movie she and l had seen sometime in the winter the boxer had fallen extremely low when he met the good old priest who had been a boxer himself in his robust youth and could still slug a sinner we sat on cushions heaped on the floor  and l was between the woman and me she had squeezed herself in the pet in my turn i launched upon a hilarious account of my arctic adventures the muse of invention hande d me a rifle and i shot a white bear who sat down and said ah all the while i was acutely aware of l’s nearness and as i spoke i gestured in the merciful dark and took advantage of those invisi ble gestures of mine to touch her hand her shoulder and a ballerina of wool and gauze which she played with and kept sticking into my lap and finally  when i had completely enmeshed my glowing darling in this weave of ethereal caresses i dared stroke her bare leg along the gooseberry fuzz of her shin and i chuckled at my own jokes and trembled and concealed my tremors and once or twice felt with my rapid lips the warmth of her hair as i treated her to a quick nuzzling humorous aside and caressed her plaything she too fidgeted a good deal so that finally her mother told her sharp ly to quit it and sent the doll flying into the dark and i laughed and addresse d myself to haze across lo’s legs to let my hand creep up my nymphet’ s thin back and feel her skin through her boy’ s shirt but i knew it was all hopeless and was sick with longing and my clothes felt mise rably tight and i was almost glad when her mother ’s quiet voiceannounced in the dark “and now we all think that lo should go to bed” “i think you stink” said lo “which means there will be no picnic tomorrow ” said haze “this is a free country ” said lo when angry lo with a bronx cheer had gone i stayed on from sheer inertia while haze smoked her tenth cigarette of the evening and complained of lo she had been spiteful if you please at the age of one when she used to throw her toys out of her crib so that her poor mother should keep picking them up the villainous infant now at twelve she was a regular pest said haze all she wanted from life was to be one day a strutting and prancing baton twirler or a jitterbug her grades were poor but she was better adjusted in her new school than in pisky pisky was the haze home town in the middle west the ramsdale house was her late mother inlaw’ s they had moved to ramsdale less than two years ago “why was she unhappy there” “oh” said haze “poor me should know

concomitant of growing up but lo exaggerates sullen and evasive rude and defiant stuck viola an italian schoolmate in the seat with a fountain pen know what i would like if you monsieur  happened to

“you’ll be here” i wanted to shout that i would stay on eternally if only i could hope to caress now and then my incipie nt pupil but i was wary of haze so i just grunted and stretched my limbs nonco ncomitantly le mot juste  and presently went up to my room the woman however  was evidently not prepared to call it a day i was already lying upon my cold bed both hands pressing to my face lolita’ s fragrant ghost when i heard my indefatigable landlady creeping stealthily up to my door to whis per through it—just to make sure she said i was through with the glance and gulp magazine i had borrowed

stay any longer in this house under the strain of this intolerable temptation bythe side of my darling— my darling—my life and my bride has she already been initiated by mother nature to the mystery

bore you very much” quoth haze “to come with us tomorrow for a swim in our glass lake if lo apologizes for her manners” later  i heard a great banging of doors and other sounds coming from quaking caverns where the two rivals were having a ripping row  she has not apologized the lake is out it might have been fun satur day for some days already i had been leaving the door ajar while i wrote in my room but only today did the trap work with a good deal of additional fidgeting shuffling scraping—to disguise her embar rassment at visiting me without having been called—lo came in and after pottering around became interested in the nightmare curlicues i had penned on a sheet of paper  oh no they were not the outcome of a bellelettri st’s inspired pause between two paragraphs they were

her mouth with perfect impunity  i knew she would let me do so and even close her eyes as hollywood teaches a double vanilla with hot fudge—hardly more unusual than that i cannot tell my learned

at a backing and turning truck in front that had just brought old invalid miss opposite a brand new wheel chair  when my lolita’ s sharp voice came from the parlor window “you where are you going i’m coming too wait” “ignore her” yelped haze killing the motor alas for my fair driver lo was already pulling at the door on my side “this is intolerable” began haze but lo had scrambled in shivering with glee “move your bottom you” said lo “lo” cried haze sideglancing at me hoping i would throw rude lo out “and behold” said lo not for the first time as she jerked back as i jerked back as the carleapt forward “it is intolerable” said haze violently getting into second “that a child should be so illma nnered and so very persevering when she knows she is unwanted and needs a bath” my knuckles lay against the child’ s blue jeans she was barefooted her toenails showed remnants of cherryred polish and there was a bit of adhesive tape across her big toe and god what would i not have given to kiss then and there those delicateboned longtoed monkeyish feet suddenly her hand slipped into mine and without our chaperon’ s seeing i held and stroked and squeezed that little hot paw all the way to the store the wings of the driver ’s marlenesque nose shone having shed or burned up their ration of powder  and she kept up an elegant monologu e anent the local traffic and smiled in profile and pouted in profile and beat her painted lashes in profile while i prayed we would never get to that store but we did i have nothing else to report save primo  that big haze had little haze sit behin d on our way home and secundo  that the lady decided to keep humbert’ s choice for the backs of her own shapely ears thursday  we are paying with hail and gale for the tropical beginning of the month in a volume of the young people’ s encyclopedia  i found a map of the states that a child’ s pencil had started copying out on a sheet of lightweight paper  upon the other side of which

and sweet was it to discover this “haze dolores” she in its special bower of names with its bodyguard of roses—a fairy princess between her two maids of honor  i am trying to analyze the spinethrill of delight it gives me this name among all those others what is it that excites me almost to tears hot opalescent thick tears that poets and lovers shed what is it the tender anonymity of this name with its formal veil “dolores” and that abstract transposition of first name and surname which is like a pair of new pale gloves or a mask is “mask”the keyword is it because there is always delight in the semitranslucent mystery  the flowing charshaf through which the flesh and the eye you alone are elected to know smile in passing at you alone or is it because i can imagine so well the rest of the

have bribed her—an d got away with it a simpler and more practical fellow would have soberly stuck to various commercial substitutes —if you know where to go i don’t despite my manly looks i am horribly timid my romantic soul gets all clammy and shivery at the thought of running into some awful indecent unpleasantness those ribald sea monsters “mais allezy  allezy ” annabel skipping on one foot to get into her shorts i seasick with rage trying to screen her  same date later quite late i have turned on the light to take down a dream it had an evident antecedent haze at dinner had benevolently proclaimed that since the weather bureau promised a sunny weekend we would go to the lake sunday after church as i lay in bed erotically musing before trying to go to sleep i thought of a final scheme how to profit by the picnic to come i was aware that mother haze hated my darling for her being sweet on me so i planned my lake day with a view to satisfying the mother  to her alone would i talk but at some appropriate moment i would say i had left my wrist watch or my sunglasses in that glade yonder—and plunge with my nymphet into the wood reality at this juncture withdrew  and the quest for the glasses turned into a quiet little orgy with a singularly knowing cheerf ul corrupt and compliant lolita behaving as reason knewshe could not possibly behave at  am i swallowed a sleeping pill and presently  a dream that was not a sequel but a parody revealed to me with a kind of meaningful clarity  the lake i had never yet visited it was glazed over with a sheet of emerald ice and a pockmarked eskimo was trying in vain to break it with a pickaxe although imported mimosas and oleanders flowered on its gravelly banks i am sure dr blanche schwarzmann would have paid me a sack of schillings for adding such a libidream to her files unfortunately  the rest of it was frankly eclectic big haze and little haze rode on horseba ck around the lake and i rode too dutifully bobbing up and down bowlegs astraddle although there was no horse between them only elastic air—one of those little omissions due to the absentmi ndedness of the dream agent satur day my heart is still thumping i still squirm and emit low moans of remembered embarrassment dorsal view  glimpse of shiny skin between tshirt and white gym shorts bending over a window sill in the act of tearing off leaves from a poplar outside while engrossed in torrential talk with a newspaper boy below kenneth knight i suspect who had just propelled the ramsdale journal with a very precise thud onto the porch i began creeping up to her —“crippling” up to her as pantomimists say my arms and legs were convex surfaces between which—rather than upon which —i slowly progressed by some neutral means of locomotion humbert the wounded spider  i must have taken hours to reach her i seemed to see her through the wrong end of a telescope and toward her taut little rear i moved like some paralytic on soft distorted limbs in terrible concentration at last i was right behind her when i had the unfortunate idea of blustering a trifle— shaking her by the scruf f of the neck and that sort of thing to cover my real manège  and she said in a shrill brief whine “cut it out”—most coarsely  the little wench and with a ghastly grin humbert the humble beat a gloomy retreat while she went on wisecracking streetward but now listen to what happene d next after lunch i was reclining in a low chair trying to read sudden ly two deft little hands were over my eyes she had crept up from behind as if reenacting in a ballet sequence my morning maneuver  her fingers were a luminous crimson as they tried to blot out the sun and she uttered hiccups of laughter and jerked this way and that as i stretch ed my arm sideways and backwards without otherwise changing my recumbent positio n my hand swept over her agile gigglinglegs and the book like a sleigh left my lap and mrs haze strolled up and said indulgently “just slap her hard if she interferes with your scholarly meditations how i love this garden no exclamation mark in her tone isn’ t it divine in the sun no question mark either” and with a sign of feigned content the obnoxious lady sank down on the grass and looked up at the sky as she leane d back on her splayedout hands and presently an old gray tennis ball bounced over her and lo’s voice came from the house haughtily “ pardonnez  mother  i was not aiming at you” of course not my hot downy darling  this proved to be the last of twenty entries or so it will be seen from them that for all the devil’s inventiveness the scheme remained daily the same first he would tempt me—and then thwart me leaving me with a dull pain in the very root of my being i knew exactly what i wanted to do and how to do it without impinging on a child’ s chastity after all i had had some experience in my life of pederosis had visually possessed dappled nymphets in parks had wedged my wary and bestial way into the hottest most crowded corner of a city bus full of straphanging school children but for almost three weeks i had been interrupted in all my pathetic machinations the agent of these interruptions was usually the haze woman who as the reader will mark was more afraid of lo’s deriving some pleasure from me than of my enjoying lo the passion i had developed for that nymphet—for the first nymphet in my life that could be reached at last by my awkward aching timid claws—would have certainly landed me again in a sanatorium had not the devil realized that i was to be granted some relief if he wanted to have me as a plaything for some time longer  the reader has also marked the curious mirage of the lake it would have been logical on the part of aubrey mcfate as i would like to dub that devil of mine to arrange a smal l treat for me on the promised beach in the presumed forest actually  the promise mrs haze had made was a fraudulent one she had not told me that mary rose hamilton a dark little beauty in her own right was to come too and that the two nymphets would be whispering apart and playi ng apart and having a good time all by themselves while mrs haze and her handsome lodger conversed sedately in the seminude far from prying eyes incidentally  eyes did pry and tongues did wag how queer life is we hasten to alienate the very fates we intended to woo before my actual arrival my landlady had planned to have an old spinster  a miss phalen whose mother had been cook in mrs haze’ s family  come to stay in the house with lolita and me while mrs haze a career girl at heart sought some suitable job in the nearest city mrs haze had seen the whole situation very clearly the bespectacled roundbackedherr humbert coming with his centraleuropean trunks to gather dust in his corner behind a heap of old books the unloved ugly little daughter firmly supervised by miss phalen who had already once had my lo under her buzzard wing lo recalled that  summer with an indignant shudder and mrs haze herself engaged as a receptionist in a great elegant city but a not too complicated event interfered with that program miss phalen broke her hip in sava nnah ga on the very day i arrived in ramsdale  the sunday after the saturday already described proved to be as bright as the weatherman had predicted when putting the breakfast things back on the chair outside my room for my good landlady to remove at her convenience i gleaned the following situation by listening from the landing across which i had softly crept to the bannisters in my old bedro om slippers —the only old things about me there had been another row mrs hamilton had telephoned that her daughter “was running a temperature” mrs haze informed her daughter that the picnic would have to be postponed hot little haze informed big cold haze that if so she would not go with her to church mother said very well and left i had come out on the landing straight after shaving soapyearlo bed still in my white pajamas with the cornflower blue not the lilac design on the back i now wiped off the soap perfumed my hair and armpits slipped on a purple silk dressing gown and humming nervously  went down the stairs in quest of lo i want my learned readers to participate in the scene i am about to replay i want them to examine its every detail and see for themselves how careful how chaste the whole winesweet event is if viewed with what my lawyer has called in a private talk we have had “impartial sympathy ” so let us get started i have a dif ficult job before me main character humbert the hummer  time sunday morning in june place sunlit living room props old candystriped davenport magazines phonograph mexican knickknacks the late mr harold e haze—god bless the good man—had enge ndered my darling at the siesta hour in a bluewashed room on a honeymoon trip to vera cruz and mementoes among these dolores were all over the place she wore that day a pretty print dress that i had seen on her once before ample in the skirt tight in the bodice shortsle eved pink checkered with darker pink and to complete the color scheme she had painte d her lips and was holding in her hollowedhands a beautifu l banal edenred apple she was not shod however  for church and her white sunday purse lay discarded near the phonograph my heart beat like a drum as she sat down cool skirt ballooning subsiding on the sofa next to me and played with her gloss y fruit she tossed it up into the sundusted air and caught it—it made a cupped polished plop humbert humbert intercepted the apple “give it back” she pleaded showing the marbled flush of her palms i produced delici ous she grasped it and bit into it and my heart was like snow under thin crimson skin and with the monkeyish nimbleness that was so typical of that american nymphet she snatched out of my abstract grip the magazine i had opened pity no film had recorded the curious pattern the monogrammic linkage of our simultaneous or overlapping moves rapidly  hardly hampered by the disfigured apple she held lo flipped violently throug h the pages in search of something she wished humbert to see found it at last i faked interest by bringing my head so close that her hair touched my temple and her arm brushed my cheek as she wiped her lips with her wrist because of the burnished mist through which i peered at the picture i was slow in reacting to it and her bare knees rubbed and knocked impatiently against each other  dimly there came into view a surrealist painter relaxing supine on a beach and near him likewise supine a plaster replica of the venus di milo halfburied in sand picture of the week said the legend i whisked the whole obscene thing away  next moment in a sham effort to retrieve it she was all over me caught her by her thin knobby wrist the magazine escaped to the floor like a flustered fowl she twisted herself free recoiled and lay back in the righthand corner of the davenport then with perfect simplicity  the impudent child extended her legs across my lap by this time i was in a state of excitement bordering on insan ity but i also had the cunning of the insane sitting there on the sofa i managed to attune by a series of stealthy movements my masked lust to her guileless limbs it was no easy matter to divert the little maiden’ s attention while i performed the obscure adjustm ents necessary for the success of the trick talking fast lagging behind my own breath catching up with it mimicking a sudden tootha che to explain the breaks in my patter—and all the while keeping a maniac’ s inner eye on my distant golden goal i cautiously increased the magic friction that was doing away  in an illusional if notfactual sense with the physically irremovable but psychologically very friable texture of the material divide pajamas and robe between the weight of two sunburnt legs resting athwart my lap and the hidden tumor of an unspeakable passion having in the course of my patter  hit upon something nicely mechanical i recited garbling them slightly  the words of a foolish song that was then popular—o my carmen my little carmen something something those something nights and the stars and the cars and the bars and the barmen i kept repeating this automatic stuff and holding her under its special spell spell because of the garbling and all the while i was mortally afraid that some act of god might interrup t me might remove the golden load in the sensation of which all my being seemed concentrated and this anxiety forced me to work for the first minute or so more hastily than was consensual with deliberately modulated enjoyment the stars that sparkled and the cars that parkled and the bars and the barmen were presently taken over by her her voice stole and corrected the tune i had been mutilating she was musical and appleswee t her legs twitched a little as they lay across my live lap i stroked them there she lolled in the righthand corner  almost asprawl lola the bobbysoxer  devouring her immemorial fruit singing through its juice losing her slipper  rubbing the heel of her slipperless foot in its sloppy anklet against the pile of old magazines heaped on my left on the sofa—and every movement she made every shuffle and ripple helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty—between my gagged bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock under my glancing finger tips i felt the minute hairs bristle ever so slightly along her shins i lost myself in the pungent but healthy heat which like summer haze hung about little haze let her stay let her stay … as she strained to chuck the core of her abolished apple into the fender  her young weight her shameless innocent shanks and round bottom shifted in my tense tortured surreptitiously laboring lap and all of a sudden a mysterious change came over my senses i entered a plane of being where nothing mattered save the infusion of joy brewed within my body  what had begun as a delicious distension of my innermost roots became a glowing tingle which now had reached that state of absolute security  confidence and reliance not found elsewhere in conscious life with the deep hot sweetness thus established and well on its way to the ultimate convulsion i felt i couldslow down in order to prolong the glow  lolita had been safely solipsized the implied sun pulsated in the supplied poplars we were fantastically and divinely alone i watched her rosy golddusted beyond the veil of my controlled delight unaware of it alien to it and the sun was on her lips and her lips were apparently still forming the words of the carmenb armen ditty that no longer reached my consciousness everything was now ready  the nerves of pleasure had been laid bare the corpuscles of krause were entering the phase of frenzy  the least pressure would suffice to set all paradise loose i had ceased to be humbert the hound the sadeyed degenerate cur clasping the boot that would presently kick him away  i was above the tribulations of ridicule beyond the possibilities of retribution in my selfmade seraglio i was a radiant and robust turk deliberately  in the full consciousness of his freedom postponing the moment of actually enjoying the youngest and frailest of his slaves suspended on the brink of that voluptuous abyss a nicety of physiological equipoise comparable to certain techniqu es in the arts i kept repeating chance words after her— barmen alarmin’ my charmin’ my carmen ahmen ahahamen—as one talking and laughing in his sleep while my happy hand crept up her sunny leg as far as the shadow of decency allowed the day before she had collided with the heavy chest in the hall and—“look look”—i gasped —“look what you’ve done what you’ve done to yourself ah look” for there was i swear  a yellowish violet bruise on her lovely nymphet thigh which my huge hairy hand massaged and slowly enveloped—and because of her very perfunctory underthings there seemed to be nothing to prevent my muscular thumb from reachi ng the hot hollow of her groin—just as you might tickle and caress a gigglin g child—just that—and “oh it’s nothing at all” she cried with a sudden shrill note in her voice and she wiggled and squirmed and threw her head back and her teeth rested on her glistening underlip as she halfturned away  and my moaning mouth gentl emen of the jury almost reached her bare neck while i crushed out against her left buttock the last throb of the longest ecstasy man or monster had ever known immediately afterward as if we had been struggling and now my grip had eased she rolled off the sofa and jumped to her feet—to her foot rather —in order to attend to the form idably loud telephone that may have been ringing for ages as far as i was concerned there she stood and blinked cheeks aflame hair awry  her eyes passing over me as lightly as they didover the furniture and as she listened or spoke to her moth er who was telling her to come to lunch with her at the chatfields—neither lo nor hum knew yet what busybody haze was plotting she kept tapping the edge of the table with the slipper she held in her hand blessed be the lord she had noticed nothing with a handkerchief of multico lored silk on which her listen ing eyes rested in passing i wiped the sweat off my forehead and immersed in a euphoria of release rearranged my royal robes she was still at the telephone haggl ing with her mother wanted to be fetched by car my little carmen when singing louder and louder  i swept up the stairs and set a deluge of steaming water roaring into the tub at this point i may as well give the words of that song hit in full—to the best of my recollection at least—i don’ t think i ever had it right here goes o my carmen my little carmen something something those something nights and the stars and the cars and the bars and the barmen— and o my charmin’ our dreadful fights and the something town where so gaily  arm in arm we went and our final row  and the gun i killed you with o my carmen the gun i am holding now  drew his  automatic i guess and put a bullet through his moll’ s eye  i had lunch in town—had not been so hungry for years the house was still loless when i strolled back i spent the afternoon musing scheming blissfully digesting my experience of the morning i felt proud of myself i had stolen the honey of a spasm without impairing the morals of a mino r absolutely no harm done the conjurer had poured milk molasses foaming champagne into a young lady’ s new white purse and lo the purse was intact thus had i delicately constructed my ignoble ardent sinful dream  and still lolita was safe—and i was safe what i had madly possessed was not she but my own creati on another  fanciful lolita—perhaps more real than lolita overlapping encasing her floating betwee n me and her and having no will no consciousness— indeed no life of her own the child knew nothing i had done nothing to her and nothing prevented me from repeating a performance that affected her as little as if she were a photographic image rippling upon a screen and i a humble hunchback abusing myself in the dark the afternoon drifted on and on in ripe silence and the sappy tall trees seemed to be in the know and desire even stronger than before began to afflict me again let her come soon i prayed addressi ng a loan god and while mamma is in the kitchen let a repetition of the davenport scene be staged please i adore her so horribly  no “horribly” is the wrong word the elation with which the vision of new delights filled me was not horrible but pathetic i qualify it as pathetic pathetic—because despite the insatiable fire of my venereal appetite i intended with the most fervent force and foresight to protect the purity of that twelveyear old child and now see how i was repaid for my pains no lolita came home—she had gone with the chatfields to a movie the table was laid with more elegance than usual candlelight if you please in this mawkish aura mrs haze gently touched the silver on both sides of her plate as if touching piano keys and smiled down on her empty plate was on a diet and said she hoped i liked the salad recipe lifted from a woman’ s magazine shehoped i liked the cold cuts too it had been a perfect day mrs chatfield was a lovely person phyllis her daughter  was going to a summer camp tomorrow  for three weeks lolita it was decided would go thursday  instead of waiting till july as had been initially planned and stay there after phyllis had left t ill school began a pretty prospect my heart oh how i was taken aback—for did it not mean i was losing my darling just when i had secretly made her mine to explain my grim mood i had to use the same toothache i had already simulated in the morning must have been an enormous molar  with an abscess as big as a maraschino cherry  “we have” said haze “an excellent dentist our neighbor  in fact dr quilty  uncle or cousin i think of the playwright think it will pass well just as you wish in the fall i shall have him ‘brace’ her as my mother used to say it may curb lo a little i am afraid she has been bothering you frightfully all these days and we are in for a couple of stormy ones before she goes she has flatly refused to go and i confess i left her with the chatfields becau se i dreaded to face her alone just yet the movie may mollify her  phyllis is a very sweet girl and there is no earthly reason for lo to dislike her really  monsieur  i am very sorry about that tooth of yours it would be so much more reasona ble to let me contact ivor quilty first thing tomorrow morning if it still hurts and you know  i think a summer camp is so much healthier  and—well it is all so much more reasonable as i say than to mope on a suburban lawn and use mamma’ s lipstick and pursue shy studious gentlemen and go into tantrums at the least provocation” “are you sure” i said at last “that she will be happy there ” lame lamentably lame “she’d better ” said haze “and it won’ t be all play either  the camp is run by shirley holmes—you know  the woman who wrote campfir e girl camp will teach dolores haze to grow in many things—health knowledge temper  and particularly in a sense of responsibility toward other people shall we take these candles with us and sit for a while on the piazza or do you want to go to bed and nurse that tooth” nurse that tooth  next day they drove downtown to buy things needed for the camp any wearable purchase worked wonders with lo she seemed her usual sarcastic self at dinner  immediately afterwards she went up to her room to plunge into the comic books acquired for rainy days at camp q they were so thoroughly samp led by thursday that she left them behind i too retired to my lair and wrote letters my plan now was to leave for the seaside and then when school began resume my existence in the haze household for i knew already that i could not live without the child on tuesda y they went shopping again and i was asked to answer the phone if the camp mistress rang up during their absence she did and a month or so later we had occasion to recall our pleasant chat that tuesday  lo had her dinner in her room she had been crying after a routine row with her mother and as had happened on former occasions had not wished me to see her swollen eyes she had one of those tender complexions that after a good cry get all blurred and inflamed and morbidly alluring i regretted keenly her mistake about my private aesthetics for i simp ly love that tinge of botticellian pink that raw rose about the lips those wet matted eyelashes and naturally  her bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation there was however more to it than i thought as we sat in the darkness of the veranda a rude wind had put out her red candles haze with a dreary laugh said she had told lo that her beloved humbert thorough ly approved of the whole camp idea “and now” added haze “the child throws a fit pretext you and i want to get rid of her actual reason i told her we would exchange tomor row for plainer stuff some much too cute night things that she bullied me into buying for her you see she sees herself as a starlet i see her as a sturdy  healthy  but decidedly homely kid this i guess is at the root of our troubles” on wednesday i managed to waylay lo for a few seconds she was on the landing in sweatshirt and greenstained white shorts rumm aging in a trunk i said something meant to be friendly and funny but she only emitted a snort without looking at me desperate dying humbert patted herclumsily on her coccyx and she struck him quite painfully  with one of the late mr  haze’ s shoetrees “doublecrosser ” she said as i crawled downstairs rubbing my arm with a great show of rue she did not condesc end to have dinner with hum and mum washed her hair and went to bed with her ridiculous books and on thursday quiet mrs haze drove her to camp q as greater authors than i have put it “let readers imagine” etc on second thought i may as well give those imaginations a kick in the pants i knew i had fallen in love with lolita forever but i also knew she would not be forev er lolit a she would be thirteen on january  in two years or so she would cease being a nymphet and would turn into a “youn g girl” and then into a “college girl”—that horror of horrors the word “forever” referred only to my own passio n to the eternal lolita as reflected in my blood the lolita whose iliac crests had not yet flared the lolita that today i could touch and smell and hear and see the lolita of the strident voice and the rich brown hair—of the bangs and the swirls at the sides and the curls at the back and the sticky hot neck and the vulgar vocabulary —“revolting” “super ” “luscious” “goon” “drip”— that lolita my lolita poor catullus would lose forever  so how could i afford not to see her for two months of summer insomni as two whole months out of the two years of her remaining nymphage should i disguise myself as a somber old fashioned girl gawky mlle humbert and put up my tent on the outskirts of camp q in the hope that its russet nymphets would clamor “let us adopt that deepvoiced dp” and drag the sad shyly smiling berthe au grand pied to their rustic hearth berthe will sleep with dolores haze idle dry dreams two months of beauty  two months of tenderness would be squandered forever  and i could do nothing about it but nothing mais rien one drop of rare honey  however  that thursday did hold in its acorn cup haze was to drive her to the camp in the early morning upon sundry sounds of departure reaching me i rolled out of bed and leane d out of the window  under the poplars the car was already athrob on the sidewalk louise stood shading her eyes with her hand as if the little traveler were already riding into the low morning sun the gesture proved to be premature “hurry up” shouted haze my lolita who was half in and about to slam the car door wind down the glass wave to louise and the poplars whom and which she was never to see again interrupted the motion of fate she looked up—and dashed back into the house hazefuriously calling after her a moment later i heard my sweetheart running up the stairs my heart expanded with such force that it almost blotted me out i hitched up the pants of my pajamas flung the door open and simultaneously lolita arrived in her sunday frock stamping panting and then she was in my arms her innocent mouth melting under the ferocious pressure of dark male jaws my palpitating darling the next instant i heard her—alive unraped—clatter downstairs the motion of fate was resumed the blond leg was pulled in the car door was slammed—was reslammed —and driver haze at the violent wheel rubber red lips writhin g in angry  inaudible speec h swung my darling away  while unnoticed by them or louise old miss opposite an invalid feebly but rhythmically waved from her vined veranda  the hollow of my hand was still ivoryfull of lolita—full of the feel of her preadolescently incurved back that ivorysmooth sliding sensation of her skin through the thin frock that i had worked up and down while i held her i march ed into her tumbled room threw open the door of the closet and plunged into a heap of crumpled things that had touched her there was particularly one pink texture sleazy torn with a faintly acrid odor in the seam i wrapped in it humbert ’s huge engor ged heart a poignant chaos was ’welling within me—but i had to drop those things and hurriedly regain my composure as i became aware of the maid’ s velvety voice calling me softly from the stairs she had a message for me she said and topping my automatic thank s with a kindly “you’re welcome” good louise left an unstamped curiously cleanlooking letter in my shaking hand this is a confession i love you so the letter began and for a distorted moment i mistook its hysterical scrawl for a schoolgirl’ s scribble last sunday in churc h—bad you who refused to come to see our beautiful new windows— only last sunday  my dear one when i asked the lord what to do about it i was told to act as i am acting now you see there is no alternative i have loved you from the minute i saw you i am a passionate and lonely woman and you are the love of my life now  my dearest dearest mon cher cher monsieur  you have read this now you know  so will you please at once  pack and leave this is a landlady’ s order  i am dism issing a lodger  i am kicking you out go scram departez i shall be back by dinnertime if i do eighty both ways and don’t have an accident but what would it matter  and i do not wish to find you in the house please please leave at once now do not even read this absurd note to the end go adieu the situation chéri  is quite simple of course i know with absolute certainty that i am nothing to you nothing at all oh yes you enjoy talking to me and kidding poor me you have grown fond of ourfriendly house of the books i like of my lovely garden even of lo’s noisy ways—but i am nothing to you right right nothing to you whatever  but if after reading my “confession” you decided in your dark romantic european way that i am attractive enough for you to take advantage of my letter and make a pass at me then you would be a criminal—wor se than a kidnaper who rapes a child you see chéri if you decided to stay if i found you at home which i know i won’ t— and that’s why i am able to go on like this the fact of your remaini ng would only mean one thing that you want me as much as i do you as a lifelong mate and that you are ready to link up your life with mine forever and ever and be a father to my little girl let me rave and ramble on for a teeny while more my dearest since i know this letter has been by now torn by you and its pieces illegible in the vortex of the toilet my dearest mon très très cher what a world of love i have built up for you during this miraculous june i know how reserved you are how “british” your oldworld reticence your sense of decorum may be shocked by the boldness of an amer ican girl you who conceal your strongest feelings must think me a shameless little idiot for throwing open my poor bruised heart like this in years gone by many disappointments came my way mr haze was a splendid person a sterling soul but he happened to be twenty years my senior  and—w ell let us not gossip about the past my dearest your curiosity must be well satisfied if you have ignored my request and read this letter to the bitter end never mind destroy it and go do not forget to leave the key on the desk in your room  and some scrap of address so that i could refund the twelve dollars i owe you till the end of the month goodbye dear one pray for me— if you ever pray  ch what i present here is what i remember of the letter  and what i remember of the letter i remem ber verbatim including that awful french it was at least twice longer  i have left out a lyrical passage which i more or less skipped at the time concern ing lolita’ s brother who died at  when she was  and how much i would have liked him let me see what else can i say yes there is just a chance that “the vortex of the toilet” whe re theletter did go is my own matter offact contribution she probably begged me to make a special fire to consume it my first movem ent was one of repulsion and retreat my second was like a friend ’s calm hand falling upon my shoulder and bidding me take my time i did i came out of my daze and found myself still in lo’s room a fullpage ad ripped out of a slick magazine was affixed to the wall above the bed between a crooner ’s mug and the lashes of a movie actress it represented a darkhaired young husband with a kind of drained look in his irish eyes he was modeling a robe by soandso and holding a bridgelike tray by soands o with breakfast for two the legend by the rev thomas morell called him a “conqueri ng hero” the thoroughly conquered lady not shown was presumably propping herself up to receive her half of the tray how her bedfellow was to get under the bridge without some messy mishap was not clear  lo had drawn a jocose arrow to the haggard lover ’s face and had put in block letters hh and indeed despite a difference of a few years the resemblance was striking under this was another picture also a colored ad a distinguished playwright was solemnly smoking a drome he always smoked dromes the resemblance was slight under this was lo’s chaste bed littered with “comics” the enamel had come off the bedstead leavin g black more or less rounded marks on the white having convinced myse lf that louise had left i got into lo’s bed and reread the letter   gentlemen of the jury i cannot swear that certain motions pertaining to the business in hand—if i may coin an expression—had not drifted across my mind before my mind had not retained them in any logical form or in any relation to definitely recollected occasions but i cannot swear—let me repeat—that i had not toyed with them to rig up yet another expression in my dimness of thought in my darkness of passion there may have been times—there must have been times if i know my humbert— when i had brought up for detached inspec tion the idea of marrying a mature widow say charlotte haze with not one relative left in the wide gray world merely in order to have my way with her child lo lola lolita i am even prepared to tell my tormentors that perhaps once or twice i had cast an appraiser ’s cold eye at charlotte’ s coral lips and bronze hair and dangerously low neckline and had vaguely tried to fit her into a plausible daydream this i confess under torture imaginary torture perhaps but all the more horrible i wish i might digress and tell you more of the pavor nocturnus that would rack me at night hideously after a chance term had struck me in the random readings of my boyhood such as peine forte et dure what a geniu s of pain must have invented that or the dreadful mysterious insidious words “trauma” “traumatic event” and “transom” but my tale is suf ficiently incondite already  after a while i destroyed the letter and went to my room and ruminated and rumpled my hair and modeled my purple robe and moaned through clenched teeth and suddenly— suddenly  gentlemen of the jury i felt a dostoevskian grin dawning through the very grimace that twisted my lips like a distant and terrible sun i imagined under conditions of new and perfect visibility all the casual caresses her mother ’s husband would be able to lavish on his lolita i would hold her against me three times a day every day all my troubles would be expelled i would be a healthy man “to hold thee lightly on a gentle knee and print on thy soft cheek a parent’ s kiss …” wellread humbertthen with all possible caution on mental tiptoe so to speak i conjured up charlotte as a possible mate by god i could make myself bring her that economically halved grapefruit that sugarless breakfast humbert humbe rt sweating in the fierce white light and howle d at and trodden upon by sweating policemen is now ready to make a further “statement”  quel mot  as he turns his conscience inside out and rips off its innermost lining i did not plan to marry poor charlotte in order to eliminate her in some vulgar  gruesome and dangerous manner such as killing her by placing five bichlorideofmercury tablets in her preprandial sherry or anything like that but a delicately allied pharmacopoeial thought did tinkle in my sonorous and clouded brain why limit myself to the modest masked caress i had tried already other visions of venery presented themselves to me swaying and smiling i saw myself administering a powerful sleepin g potion to both mother and daughter so as to fondle the latter through the night with perfect impunity  the house was full of charlotte’ s snore while lolita hardly breathed in her sleep as still as a painted girlchild “mother  i swear kenny never even touched me” “you either lie dolores haze or it was an incubus” no i would not go that far  so humbert the cubus schemed and dreamed—and the red sun of desire and decision the two things that create a live world rose higher and higher  while upon a succession of balconies a succession of libertines sparkling glass in hand toasted the bliss of past and future nights then figuratively speaking i shattered the glass and boldly imagined for i was drunk on those visions by then and underrated the gentleness of my nature how eventually i might blackmail—no that is too strong a word— mauvemail big haze into letting me consort with little haze by gently threatening the poor doting big dove with desertion if she tried to bar me from playing with my legal stepdaughter  in a word before such an amazing offer before such a vastness and variety of vistas i was as helpless as adam at the preview of early oriental history  miraged in his apple orchard and now take down the following important remark the artist in me has been given the upper hand over the gentleman it is with a great effort of will that in this memoir i have managed to tune my style to the tone of the journal that i kept when mrs haze was to me but an obstacle that journal of mine is no more but i have considered it my artistic duty to preserve its intonations no matter how false and brutal they may seem to me nowfortunately  my story has reach ed a point where i can cease insulting poor charlotte for the sake of retrospective verisimilitude wishing to spare poor charlotte two or three hours of suspense on a winding road and avoid perhaps a headon collision that would shatter our different dreams  i made a thoughtful but abortive attempt to reach her at the camp by telephone she had left half an hour before and getting lo instead i told her—trembling and brimming with my mastery over fate— that i was going to marry her mother  i had to repeat it twice because something was preventing her from giving me her attention “gee that’s swell” she said laughing “when is the wedding hold on a sec the pup— that pup here has got hold of my sock listen—” and she added she guessed she was going to have loads of fun … and i realized as i hung up that a couple of hours at that camp had been sufficient to blot out with new impressions the image of hands ome humbert humbert from little lolita’ s mind but what did it matter now i would get her back as soon as a decent amount of time after the wedding had elapsed “the orange blossom would have scarcely withered on the grave” as a poet might have said but i am no poet i am only a very conscientious recorder  after louise had gone i inspec ted the icebox and finding it much too puritanic walked to town and bought the richest foods avail able i also bought some good liquor and two or three kinds of vitamins i was pretty sure that with the aid of these stimulants and my natural resources i would avert any embarrassment that my indif ference might incur when called upon to displ ay a strong and impa tient flame again and again resourceful humbert evoked charlotte as seen in the rareeshow of a manly imagination she was well groomed and shapely  this i could say for her and she was my lolita’ s big sister—this notion perhaps i could keep up if only i did not visualize too realistically her heavy hips round knees ripe bust the coarse pink skin of her neck “coarse” by comparison with silk and honey and all the rest of that sorry and dull thing a handsome woman the sun made its usual round of the house as the afternoon ripened into evening i had a drink and another  and yet another  gin and pineapple juice my favorite mixture always double my energy i decid ed to busy myself with our unkempt lawn une petite attention  it was crowded with dandelions and a cursed dog—i loathe dogs—had defiled the flat stones where a sundial had once stood  most of the dandelions had changed from suns to moons the gin and lolita were dancing in me and i almost fellover the folding chairs that i attempted to dislodge incarnadine zebras there are some eructations that sound like cheers—at least mine did an old fence at the back of the garden separated us from the neighbor ’s garbage receptacles and lilacs but there was nothing between the front end of our lawn where it sloped along one side of the house and the street therefore i was able to watch with the smirk of one about to perform a good action for the return of charlotte that tooth should be extracted at once as i lurch ed and lunged with the hand mower  bits of grass optically twittering in the low sun i kept an eye on that section of suburban street it curved in from under an archway of huge shade trees then sped towards us down down quite sharply  past old miss opposite’ s ivied brick house and highsloping lawn much trimmer than ours and disappeared behind our own front porch which i could not see from where i happily belched and labored the dandelions peris hed a reek of sap mingled with the pineapple two little girls mari on and mabel whose comings and goings i had mechanically followed of late but who could replace my lolita went toward the avenue from which our lawn street cascaded one pushing a bicycle the other feeding from a paper bag both talking at the top of their sunny voices leslie old miss opposite’ s gardener and chauf feur a very amiable and athletic negro grinned at me from afar and shouted re shouted comme nted by gesture that i was mighty energetic today  the fool dog of the prosperous junk dealer next door ran after a blue car—not charlotte’ s the prettier of the two little girls mabel i think shorts halter with little to halt bright hair—a nymphet by pan—ran back down the street crumpling her paper bag and was hidden from this green goat by the frontage of mr and mrs humbert’ s residence a station wagon popped out of the leafy shade of the avenue dragging some of it on its roof before the shadows snapped and swung by at an idiotic pace the sweatshirted driver roofholding with his left hand and the junkman’ s dog tearing alongside there was a smiling pause— and then with a flutter in my breast i witnessed the return of the blue sedan i saw it glide downhill and disappear behind the corner of the house i had a glimpse of her calm pale profile it occurred to me that until she went upstairs she woul d not know whether i had gone or not a minute later with an expression of great anguish on her face she looked down at me from the window of lo’s room by sprinting upstairs i managed to reach that room before she left it  when the bride is a widow and the groom is a widower when the former has lived in our great little town for hardly two years and the latter for hardly a month when monsieur wants to get the whole damned thing over with as quickly as possible and madame gives in with a tolerant smile then my reader  the wedding is generally a “quiet” affair the bride may dispense with a tiara of orange blossoms securing her finger tip veil nor does she carry a white orchid in a prayer book the bride’ s little daughter might have added to the ceremonies uniting h and h a touch of vivid vermeil but i knew i would not dare be too tender with cornered lolita yet and therefore agreed it was not worth while tearing the child away from her beloved camp q my soidisant passionate and lonely charlotte was in everyday life matter offact and gregarious moreover  i discovered that although she could not control her heart or her cries she was a woman of principle immediately after she had become more or less my mistress despite the stimulants her “nervous eager chéri ”—a heroic chéri —had some initial trouble for which however  he amply compensated her by a fantastic display of oldworld endearments good charlotte interviewed me about my relations with god i could have answered that on that score my mind was open i said instead—paying my tribute to a pious platitude—that i believed in a cosmic spirit looking down at her fingernails she also asked me had i not in my family a certain strange strain i countered by inquiring whether she would still want to marry me if my father ’s maternal grandfather had been say  a turk she said it did not matter a bit but that if she ever found out i did not believe in our christian god she would commit suicide she said it so solemnly that it gave me the creeps it was then i knew she was a woman of principle oh she was very genteel she said “excuse me” whenever a slight burp interrupted her flowing speech called an envelope an ahnvelope and when talking to her ladyfriends referred to me as mr humbert i thought it would please her if i entered the community trailing some glamor after meon the day of our wedding a little interview with me appeared in the society column of the ramsdale journal  with a photogr aph of charlotte one eyebrow up and a mispr int in her name “hazer” despite this contretemps the publicity warm ed the porcelain cockles of her heart—and made my rattles shake with awful glee by engaging in church work as well as by getting to know the better mothers of lo’s schoolmates charlotte in the course of twenty months or so had managed to become if not a prominent at least an acceptab le citizen but never before had she come under that thrilli ng rubrique  and it was i who put her there mr edgar h humbert i threw in the “edgar” just for the heck of it “writer and explorer ” mcc oo’s brother  when taking it down asked me what i had written whatev er i told him came out as “several books on peacock rainbow and other poets” it was also noted that charlotte and i had known each other for several years and that i was a distant relation of her first husband i hinted i had had an affair with her thirteen years ago but this was not mentioned in print to charlotte i said that society columns should contain a shimmer of errors let us go on with this curious tale when called upon to enjoy my promotion from lodger to lover  did i experience only bitterness and distaste no mr humbert confesses to a certain titillation of his vanity  to some faint tenderness even to a pattern of remorse daintily running along the steel of his conspiratorial dagger  never had i thought that the rather ridiculous thoug h rather handsome mrs haze with her blind faith in the wisdom of her church and book club her mannerisms of elocution her harsh cold contemptuous attitude toward an adorable downyarmed child of twelve could turn into such a touching helpless creature as soon as i laid my hands upon her which happened on the threshold of lolita’ s room whither she tremulously backed repeating “no no please no” the transformat ion improved her looks her smile that had been such a contrived thing thenceforth became the radiance of utter adoration—a radiance having something soft and moist about it in which with wonder  i recognized a resemblance to the lovely  inane lost look that lo had when gloating over a new kind of concoction at the soda fountain or mutely admiring my expensive always tailor fresh clothes deeply fascinated i would watch charlotte while she swapped parental woes with some other lady and made that national grimace of feminine resignation eyes rolling up mouth drooping sideways which in an infantile form i had seen lomaking herself we had highba lls before turning in and with their help i would manage to evoke the child while caressing the mother  this was the white stomach within which my nymphet had been a little curved fish in  this carefully dyed hair so sterile to my sense of smell and touch acquired at certain lamplit mom ents in the poster bed the tinge if not the texture of lolita’ s curls i kept telling myself as i wielded my brandnew largeaslife wife that biologically this was the nearest i could get to lolita that at lolita’ s age lotte had been as desirable a schoolgirl as her daughter was and as lolita’s daughter would be some day i had my wife unearth from under a collection of shoes mr haze had a passion for them it appears a thirtyyear old album so that i might see how lotte had looked as a child and even though the light was wrong and the dresses graceless i was able to make out a dim first version of lolita’ s outline legs cheekbones bobbed nose lottelita lolitchen so i tompeeped across the hedges of years into wan little wind ows and when by means of pitifully ardent naïvely lascivious caresses she of the noble nipple and massive thigh prepared me for the perform ance of my nightly duty it was still a nymphet’ s scent that in despair i tried to pick up as i bayed through the under growth of dark decaying forests i simply can’t tell you how gentle how touching my poor wife was at breakfast in the depressingly bright kitchen with its chrome glitter and hardware and co calendar and cute breakfast nook simulating that coffee shoppe where in their college days charlotte and humbert used to coo together she would sit robed in red her elbow on the plastict opped table her cheek propped on her fist and stare at me with intolerable tenderness as i consumed my ham and eggs humbert’ s face might twitch with neuralgia but in her eyes it vied in beauty and animation with the sun and shadows of leaves rippling on the white refrigerator  my solemn exasperation was to her the silence of love my small income added to her even smaller one impressed her as a brilliant fortune not because the resultin g sum now sufficed for most middleclass needs but because even my money shone in her eyes with the magic of my manliness and she saw our joint account as one of those southern boulevards at midday that have solid shade on one side and smooth sunshine on the other  all the way to the end of a prospect where pink mountains loom into the fifty days of our cohabi tation charlotte crammed the activities of as many years the poor woman busied herself with a number of things shehad foregone long before or had never been much interested in as if to prolong these proustian intonations by my marrying the mother of the child i loved i had enabled my wife to regain an abundance of youth by proxy  with the zest of a banal young bride she started to “glorify the home” knowing as i did its every cranny by heart—since those days when from my chair i mentally mapped out lolita’ s course through the house—i had long entered into a sort of emotional relationship with it with its very ugliness and dirt and now i could almost feel the wretched thing cower in its reluctance to endure the bath of ecru and ocher and puttybuf fandsnuf f that charlotte planned to give it she never got as far as that thank god but she did use up a tremendous amount of energy in washing wind ow shades waxing the slats of venetian blinds purchasing new shades and new blinds returning them to the store replacing them by others and so on in a constant chiaros curo of smiles and frowns doubts and pouts she dabbled in cretonnes and chintzes she changed the colors of the sofa—the sacred sofa where a bubble of paradise had once burst in slow motion within me she rearranged the furniture— and was pleased when she found in a household treatise that “it is permissible to separate a pair of sofa commodes and their companion lamps” with the authoress of your home is you she developed a hatred for little lean chairs and spindle tables she believed that a room having a generous expanse of glass and lots of rich wood paneling was an example of the masculine type of room whereas the feminine type was characterized by lighter looking windows and frailer woodwork the novels i had found her reading when i moved in were now replaced by illustrated catalogues and homemaking guides from a firm located at  roosevelt blvd philadelphia she ordered for our double bed a “damask covered  coil mattress”—although the old one seemed to me resilient and durable enough for whatever it had to support a midw esterner  as her late husband had also been she had lived in coy ramsdale the gem of an eastern state not long enough to know all the nice people she knew slightly the jovial dentist who lived in a kind of ramshackle wooden chateau behind our lawn she had met at a church tea the “snooty” wife of the local junk dealer who owned the “colo nial” white horror at the corner of the avenue now and then she “visited with” old miss opposite but the more patrician matrons among those she called upon or met at lawn functions or had telephone chats with— such dainty ladies as mrs glave mrs sheridan mrs mccrystal mrs knight andothers seldom seemed to call on my neglected charlotte indeed the only couple with whom she had relations of real cordiality  devoid of any arrièr epensée or practical foresight were the farlows who had just come back from a business trip to chile in time to attend our wedding with the chatfields mcc oos and a few others but not mrs junk or the even prouder mrs talbot john farlow was a middleaged quiet quietly athletic quietly successful dealer in sporting goods who had an office at parkington forty miles away it was he who got me the cartridges for that colt and showed me how to use it during a walk in the woods one sunday he was also what he called with a smile a parttime lawyer and had handled some of charlotte’ s affairs jean his youngish wife and first cousin was a longlimbed girl in harlequin glasses with two boxer dogs two pointed breasts and a big red mouth she painted—landscapes and portraits—and vividly do i remember praising over cocktails the picture she had made of a niece of hers little rosaline honeck a rosy honey in a girl scout uniform beret of green worsted  belt of green webbing charmin g shoulder  long curls—and john removed his pipe and said it was a pity dolly my dolita and rosaline were so critical of each other at school but he hoped they would get on better when they returned from their respec tive camps we talked of the school it had its drawbacks and it had its virtues “of course too many of the tradesp eople here are italians” said john “but on the other hand we are still spared—” “i wish” interrupted jean with a laugh “dolly and rosaline were spending the summer together ” suddenly i imagined lo returning from camp—brown warm drowsy  drugged—and was ready to weep with passion and impatience  a few words more about mrs humbert while the going is good a bad accident is to happen quite soon i had been always aware of the possessive streak in her but i never thought she would be so crazily jealous of anything in my life that had not been she she showed a fierce insatiable curiosity for my past she desired me to resuscitate all my loves so that she might make me insult them and trample upon them and revoke them apostately and totally  thus destroying my past she made me tell her about my marriage to valeria who was of course a scream but i also had to invent or to pad atrociously  a long series of mistresses for charlotte’ s morbid delectation to keep her happy  i had to present her with an illustrated catalogue of them all nicely differentiated according to the rules of those american ads where schoolchildren are pictured in a subtle ratio of races with one—only one but as cute as they make them— chocolate colored roundeyed little lad almost in the very middle of the front row so i presen ted my women and had them smile and sway—the languorous blond the fiery brunette the sensual copperhead—as if on parade in a bordello the more popular and platitudinous i made them the more mrs humbert was pleased with the show  never in my life had i confessed so much or received so many confessions the sincerity and artlessness with which she discussed what she called her “lovelife” from first necking to connubial catchascatch can were ethically  in striking contrast with my glib compositions but technically the two sets were congeneric since both were affected by the same stuff soap operas psychoanalysis and cheap novelettes upon which i drew for my characters and she for her mode of expression i was considerably amused by certain remarkable sexual habits that the good harold haze had had according to charlotte who thought my mirth improper but otherwise her autobiography was as devoid of interests as her autopsy would have been i never saw a healthier woman than she despite thinning dietsof my lolita she seldom spoke—more seldom in fact than she did of the blurred blond male baby whose photograph to the exclu sion of all others adorned our bleak bedroom in one of her tasteless reveries she predicted that the dead infant’ s soul would return to earth in the form of the child she would bear in her present wedlock and although i felt no special urge to supply the humbert line with a replica of harold’ s production lolita with an incestuous thrill i had grown to regard as my child it occurred to me that a prolonged confinement with a nice caesarean operation and other complicatio ns in a safe maternity ward sometime next spring would give me a chance to be alone with my lolita for weeks perhaps—and gor ge the limp nymphet with sleeping pills oh she simply hated her daughter what i thought especially vicious was that she had gone out of her way to answer with great diligence the questionnaires in a fool’ s book she had a guide to your child’ s development  publis hed in chicago the rigmarole went year by year and mom was supposed to fill out a kind of inventory at each of her child’ s birthdays on lo’s twelfth january   charlotte haze née becker  had underlined the following epithets ten out of forty  under “your child’ s personality” aggressive boister ous critical distrustful impatie nt irritable inquisitive listless negativistic underlined twice and obstinate she had ignored the thirty remaining adjectives among which were cheerful co operative energetic and so forth it was really maddening with a brutality that otherwise never appeared in my loving wife’ s mild nature she attacked and routed such of lo’s little belongings that had wandered to various parts of the house to freeze there like so many hypnotized bunnies little did the good lady dream that one morning when an upset stomach the result of my trying to improve on her sauces had prevented me from accompanying her to church i deceived her with one of lolita’ s anklets and then her attitude toward my saporous darling’ s letters dear mummy and hummy  hope you are fine thank you very much for the candy  i crossed out and rewritten again i lost my new sweater in the woods it has been cold here for the last few days i’m having a time love dolly “the dumb child” said mrs humbert “has left out a word before ‘time’ that sweater was allwool and i wish you would not send her candy without consulting me”  there was a woodlake hour glass lake —not as i had thought it was spelled a few miles from ramsdale and there was one week of great heat at the end of july when we drove there daily  i am now obliged to describe in some tedious detail our last swim there together  one tropi cal tuesday morning we had left the car in a parking area not far from the road and were making our way down a path cut through the pine forest to the lake when charlotte remar ked that jean farlow  in quest of rare light effects jean belonged to the old school of painting had seen leslie taking a dip “in the ebony” as john had quipped at five o’clock in the morning last sunday  “the water ” i said “must have been quite cold” “that is not the point” said the logical doomed dear “he is subnormal you see and” she continued in that carefully phrased way of hers that was beginning to tell on my health “i have a very definite feeling our louise is in love with that moron” feeling “we feel dolly is not doing as well” etc from an old school report the humberts walked on sandaled and robed “do you know  hum i have one most ambitious dream” pronounced lady hum lowering her head— shy of that dream—and communing with the tawny ground “i would love to get hold of a real trained servant maid like that german girl the t albots spoke of and have her live in the house” “no room” i said “come” she said with her quizzical smile “surely  chéri  you underestimate the possibilities of the humbert home we woul d put her in lo’s room i intended to make a guestroom of that hole anyway  it’s the coldest and meanest in the whole house” “what are you talking about” i asked the skin of my cheekbones tensing up this i take the troub le to note only because my daughter ’s skin did the same when she felt that way disbelief disgust irritation“are you bothered by romantic associations” queried my wife—in allusion to her first surrender  “hell no” said i “i just wonder where will you put your daugh ter when you get your guest or your maid” “ah” said mrs humbert dreaming smiling drawing out the “ah” simultaneously with the raise of one eyebrow and a soft exhalation of breath “little lo i’m afraid does not enter the picture at all at all little lo goes straight from camp to a good boarding school with strict discipline and some sound religious training and then—beardsley college i have it all mapped out you need not worry ” she went on to say that she mrs humbert would have to overcome her habitual sloth and write to miss phalen’ s sister who taught at st algebra the dazzling lake emer ged i said i had forgotten my sunglasses in the car and would catch up with her  i had always thought that wringing one’s hands was a fictional gesture— the obscure outcome perhaps of some medieval ritual but as i took to the woods for a spell of despair and desperate meditation this was the gesture “look lord at these chains” that would have come nearest to the mute expression of my mood had charlotte been valeria i would have known how to handle the situation and “handle” is the word i want in the good old days by merely twisting fat valechka’ s brittle wrist the one she had fallen upon from a bicycle i could make her change her mind instantly but anything of the sort in regard to charlotte was unthinkable bland america n charlotte frightened me my lighthearted dream of controlling her through her passion for me was all wrong i dared not do anything to spoil the image of me she had set up to adore i had toadied to her when she was the awesome duenna of my darling and a groveling something still persi sted in my attitude toward her the only ace i held was her ignorance of my monstrous love for her lo she had been annoyed by lo’s liking me but my feelings she could not divine to valeria i might have said “look here you fat fool c’est moi qui décide what is good for dolores humbert” to charlotte i could not even say with ingratiating calm “excuse me my dear i disagree let us give the child one more chance let me be her private tutor for a year or so you once told me yourself—” in fact i could not say anything at all to charlotte about the child without giving myself away  oh you cannot imagine as i had never imagined what these women ofprinciple are charlotte who did not notice the falsity of all the everyday conventions and rules of behavior  and foods and books and people she doted upon would distinguish at once a false intonation in anything i might say with a view to keeping lo near she was like a musician who may be an odious vulgarian in ordinary life devoid of tact and taste but who will hear a false note in music with diabolical accuracy of judgment to break charlotte’ s will i would have to break her heart if i broke her heart her image of me would break too if i said “either i have my way with lolita and you help me to keep the matter quiet or we part at once” she would have turned as pale as a woman of clouded glass and slowly replied “all right whatever you add or retract this is the end” and the end it would be such then was the mess i remember reaching the parking area and pumping a handful of rusttasting water  and drinking it as avidly as if it could give me magic wisdom youth freedom a tiny concu bine for a while purplerobed heeldangling i sat on the edge of one of the rude tables under the wooshing pines in the middle distance two little maidens in shorts and halters came out of a sundappled privy marked “women” gumchewing mabel or mabel’ s understudy laboriously  absen tmindedly  straddled a bicycle and marion shaking her hair because of the flies settled behind legs wide apart and wobbling they slowly  absently  merged with the light and shade lolita father and daughter melting into these woods the natural solution was to destroy mrs humbert but how no man can bring about the perfect murder chance however  can do it there was the famous dispatch of a mme lacour in arles southern france at the close of last century  an unidentified bearded sixfooter  who it was later conjectured  had been the lady’ s secret lover  walked up to her in a crowded street soon after her marriage to colonel lacour  and mortally stabbed her in the back three times while the colonel a small bulldog of a man hung onto the murdere r’s arm by a miraculous and beautiful coincidence right at the mom ent when the operator was in the act of loosening the angry little husb and’s jaws while several onlookers were closing in upon the group a cranky italian in the house nearest to the scene set off by sheer accident some kind of explosive he was tinkerin g with and immediately the street was turned into a pandemonium of smoke falling bricks and running people the explosion hurt no one except that it knocked out game colonel laco ur but the lady’ s vengeful lover ran when the others ran—and lived happily ever after now look what happens when the operator himself plans a perfect removal i walked down to hour glass lake the spot from which we and a few other “nice” couples the farlows the chatfields bathed was a kind of small cove my charlotte liked it because it was almost “a private beach” the main bathing facilities or “drowning facilities” as the ramsdale journal had had occas ion to say were in the left eastern part of the hourglass and could not be seen from our covelet to our right the pines soon gave way to a curve of marshland which turned again into forest on the opposite side i sat down beside my wife so noiselessly that she started “shall we go in” she asked “we shall in a minute let me follow a train of thought” i thought more than a minute passed “all right come on” “was i on that train” “you certainly were” “i hope so” said charlotte entering the water  it soon reached the gooseflesh of her thick thighs and then joining her outstretched hands shutting her mouth tight very plainfaced in her black rubber headgear  charlotte flung herself forward with a great splash slowly we swam out into the shimmer of the lake on the opposite bank at least a thousand paces away if one could walk across water i could make out the tiny figures of two men working like beavers on their stretch of shore i knew exactly who they were a retired policeman of polish descent and the retired plumber who owned most of the timber on that side of the lake and i also knew they were engaged in building just for the dismal fun of the thing a wharf the knocks that reached us seemed so much bigger than what could be distinguished of those dwarfs’ arms and tools indeed one suspected the director of those acrosonic effects to have been at odds with the puppetmaster  especially since the hefty crack of each diminutive blow lagged behin d its visual version the short whitesand strip of “our” beach—from which by now we had gone a little way to reach deep water—was empty on weekda y mornings there was nobo dy around except those two tiny very busy figures on the opposite side and a darkred private plane that droned overhea d and thendisappeared in the blue the setting was really perfect for a brisk bubbling murder  and here was the subtle point the man of law and the man of water were just near enough to witne ss an accident and just far enough not to observe a crime they were near enough to hear a distra cted bather thrashing about and bellowing for somebody to come and help him save his drowning wife and they were too far to distinguish if they happened to look too soon that the anything but distracted swimmer was finishing to tread his wife underfoot i was not yet at that stage i merely want to convey the ease of the act the nicety of the setting so there was charlotte swimming on with dutiful awkwardness she was a very mediocre mermaid but not without a certain solemn pleasure for was not her merman by her side and as i watched with the stark lucidity of a future recollection you know—trying to see things as you will remem ber having seen them the glossy whitenes s of her wet face so little tanned despite all her ende avors and her pale lips and her naked convex forehe ad and the tight black cap and the plump wet neck i knew that all i had to do was to drop back take a deep breath then grab her by the ankle and rapidly dive with my captive corpse i say corpse because surprise panic and inexperience would cause her to inhale at once a lethal gallon of lake while i would be able to hold on for at least a full minute openeyed under water  the fatal gesture passed like the tail of a falling star across the blackness of the contemplated crime it was like some dreadful silent balle t the male dancer holding the ballerina by her foot and streaking down through watery twilight i might come up for a mouthful of air while still holdin g her down and then would dive again as many times as would be necessa ry and only when the curtain came down on her for good would i permit myself to yell for help and when some twen ty minutes later the two puppets steadily growing arrived in a rowboat one half newly painted poor mrs humbert humbert the victim of a cramp or coronary occlusion or both would be standing on her head in the inky ooze some thirty feet below the smiling surface of hour glass lake simple was it not but what d’ye know  folks—i just could not make myself do it she swam besid e me a trustful and clumsy seal and all the logic of passion screame d in my ear now is the time and folks i just couldn’ t in silence i turned shoreward and gravely  dutifully  she also turned and still hell screamed its counsel and still i could not make myself drow n the poorslippery  bigbod ied creature the scream grew more and more remote as i realized the melancholy fact that neither tomorrow  nor friday  nor any other day or night could i make myself put her to death oh i could visualize myself slapping valeria’ s breasts out of alignment or otherwise hurting her—and i could see myself no less clearly  shooting her lover in the underbelly and making him say “akh” and sit down but i could not kill charlotte—especially when things were on the whole not quite as hopeless perhaps as they seemed at first wince on that miserable morning were i to catch her by her strong kicking foot were i to see her amazed look hear her awful voice were i still to go through with the ordeal her ghost would haunt me all my life perhaps if the year were  instead of  i might have hoodwinke d my gentle nature by administering her some classical poison from a hollow agate some tender philter of death but in our middleclass nosy era it would not have come off the way it used to in the brocaded palace s of the past nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a killer  no no i was neither  ladies and gentlemen of the jury the majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing sweet moaning physical but not necessarily coital relation with a girlchild are innocuous inadequate passive timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless socalled aberrant behavi or their little hot wet private acts of sexua l deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them we are not sex fiends w e do not rape as good soldiers do w e are unhappy  mild dogeyed gentlemen sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet emph atically  no killers are we poets never kill oh my poor charlotte do not hate me in your eternal heaven among an eternal alchemy of asphalt and rubber and metal and stone—but thank god not water  not water nonetheless it was a very close shave speaking quite objectively  and now comes the point of my perfectcrime parable we sat down on our towels in the thirsty sun she looked around loosened her bra and turned over on her stomach to give her back a chance to be feasted upon she said she loved me she sighed deeply  she extended one arm and groped in the pocket of her robe for her cigarettes she sat up and smoked she examined her right shoulder  she kissed me heavily withopen smoky mouth suddenly  down the sand bank behind us from under the bushes and pines a stone rolled then another  “those disgusting prying kids” said charlotte holding up her big bra to her breast and turning prone again “i shall have to speak about that to peter krestovski” from the debou chment of the trail came a rustle a footfall and jean farlow marched down with her easel and things “you scared us” said charlotte jean said she had been up there in a place of green concealmen t spying on natur e spies are generally shot trying to finish a lakescape but it was no good she had no talent whatever which was quite true— “and have you ever tried painting humbert” charlotte who was a little jealous of jean wanted to know if john was coming he was he was coming home for lunch today  he had dropped her on the way to parkington and should be picking her up any time now it was a grand morning she always felt a traitor to cavall and melampus for leaving them roped on such gorgeous days she sat down on the white sand between charlotte and me she wore shorts her long brown legs were about as attractiv e to me as those of a chestnut mare she showed her gums when she smiled “i almost put both of you into my lake” she said “i even noticed something you overlooked you addressing humbert had your wrist watch on in yes sir  you had” “waterproof” said charlotte softly  making a fish mouth jean took my wrist upon her knee and examined charlotte’ s gift then put back humbert’ s hand on the sand palm up “you could see anything that way ” remarked charlotte coquettishly  jean sighed “i once saw” she said “two children male and female at sunset right here making love their shadows were giants and i told you about mr tomson at daybreak next time i expect to see fat old ivor in the ivory  he is really a freak that man last time he told me a completely indecent story about his nephew  it appears—” “hullo there” said john’ s voice  my habit of being silent when displeased or more exactly  the cold and scaly quality of my displeased silence used to frighten valeria out of her wits she used to whimper and wail saying “ce qui me rend folle c’est que je ne sais à quoi tu penses quan d tu es connne ça” i tried being silent with charlotte—and she just chirped on or chucked my silence under the chin an aston ishing woman i would retire to my former room now a regular “studio” mumbling i had after all a learned opus to write and cheerfully charlotte went on beautifying the home warbling on the telephone and writing letters from my windo w through the lacquered shiver of poplar leaves i could see her crossing the street and contented ly mailing her letter to miss phalen’ s sister  the week of scattered showers and shadows which elapsed after our last visit to the motionless sands of hour glass lake was one of the gloomiest i can recall then came two or three dim rays of hope—before the ultimate sunburst it occurred to me that i had a fine brain in beautiful working order and that i might as well use it if i dared not meddle with my wife’ s plans for her daughter getting warmer and browner every day in the fair weather of hopeless distance i could surely devise some general means to assert myself in a general way that might be later directed toward a particular occasion one evening charlotte herself provided me with an opening “i have a surprise for you” she said looking at me with fond eyes over a spoonful of soup “in the fall we two are going to england” i swallowed my spoonful wiped my lips with pink paper oh the cool rich linens of mirana hotel and said “i have also a surprise for you my dear we two are not going to england” “why  what’s the matter” she said looking—with more surprise than i had counted upon—at my hand s i was involuntarily folding and tearing and crushing and tearing again the innocent pink napkin my smiling face set her somewhat at ease however “the matter is quite simple” i replied “even in the most harm onious of households as ours is not all decisions are taken by the female partner  there are certa in things that the husband is there to decide i can well imagine the thrill that you a healthy american gal must experience at crossing the atlantic on the same ocean liner with lady bumble—or sam bumble the frozen meat king or a hollywood harlot and i doubt not that you and i would make a pretty ad for the traveling agency when portrayed looking—you frankly starryeyed i controlling my envious admiration— at the palace sentries or scarlet guards or beaver eaters or whatever they are calle d but i happen to be allergic to europe including merry old england as you well know  i have nothing but very sad associations with the old and rotting world no colored ads in your magazines will change the situation” “my darling” said charlotte “i really—” “no wait a minute the present matter is only incidental i am concerned with a general trend when you wanted me to spend my afternoons sunbathing on the lake instead of doing my work i gladly gave in and became a bronzed glamor boy for your sake instead of remaining a scholar and well an educator  when you lead me to bridge and bourbon with the charming farlow s i meekly follow  no please wait when you decorate your home i do not interfere with your schemes when you decide—when you decide all kinds of matters i may be in complete or in partial let us say disagreeme nt—but i say nothing i ignore the particular  i cannot ignore the general i love being bossed by you but every game has its rules i am not cross i am not cross at all don’ t do that but i am one half of this household and have a small but distinct voice” she had come to my side and had fallen on her knees and was slowly  but very vehemently  shaking her head and clawing at my trousers she said she had never realized she said i was her ruler and her god she said louise had gone and let us make love right away  she said i must forgive her or she would die this little incident filled me with considerable elation i told her quietly that it was a matter not of askin g forgiveness but of changing one’s ways and i resolved to press my adva ntage and spend a good deal of time aloof and moody  working at my book—or at least pretending to work the “studio bed” in my former room had long been converted into the sofa it had always been at heart and charlotte had warned me since thevery beginning of our cohabitation that gradually the room would be turned into a regular “writer’s den” a couple of days after the british incident i was sitting in a new and very comfortable easy chair  with a large volume in my lap when charlotte rapped with her ring finger and sauntered in how different were her movements from those of my lolita when she used to visit me in her dear dirty blue jeans smelling of orchards in nymphetland awkward and fey and dimly depraved the lower buttons of her shirt unfastened let me tell you however  something behind the brashness of little haze and the poise of big haze a trickle of shy life ran that tasted the same that murmured the same a great french doctor once told my father that in near relatives the faintest gastric gur gle has the same “voice” so char lotte sauntered in she felt all was not well between us i had pretended to fall asleep the night before and the night before that as soon as we had gone to bed and had risen at dawn tenderly  she inquired if she were not “interrupting” “not at the moment” i said turning volume c of the girls’ encyclopedia around to examine a picture printed “bottomedge” as printers say  charlotte went up to a little table of imitation mahogany with a drawer  she put her hand upon it the little table was ugly no doubt but it had done nothing to her  “i have always wanted to ask you” she said businesslike not coquettish “why is this thing locked up do you want it in this room it’s so abominably uncouth” “leave it alone” i said i was camping in scandinavia “is there a key” “hidden” “oh hum …” “locked up love letters” she gave me one of those woun deddoe looks that irritated me so much and then not quite knowing if i was serious or how to keep up the conversation stood for several slow pages campus canada candid camera candy peering at the windowpane rather than through it drumming upon it with sharp almondandrose fingernails presently at canoeing or canvasback she strolled up to my chair and sank down tweedily  weightily  on its arm inundating me with the perfume my first wife had used “would his lords hip like to spend the fall here” she asked pointing with her little finger at an autumn view in a conservativeeastern state “why” very distinctly and slowly she shrugged probably harold used to take a vacation at that time open season conditional reflex on her part “i think i know where that is” she said still pointing “there is a hotel i remember  enchanted hunters quaint isn’t it and the food is a dream and nobody bothers anybody ” she rubbed her cheek against my temple v aleria soon got over that “is there anything special you would like for dinner  dear john and jean will drop in later ” i answe red with a grunt she kissed me on my underlip and brightly saying she woul d bake a cake a tradition subsisted from my lodging days that i adored her cakes left me to my idleness carefully puttin g down the open book where she had sat it attempted to send forth a rotation of waves but an inserted pencil stopped the pages i checked the hiding place of the key rather selfconsciously it lay under the old expensive safety razor i had used before she bought me a much better and cheaper one was it the perfect hiding place—there under that razor  in the groove of its velvetlined case the case lay in a small trunk where i kept various business papers could i improve upon this rema rkable how difficult it is to conceal things—especially when one’s wife keeps monkeying with the furniture  i think it was exactly a week after our last swim that the noon mail brought a reply from the second miss phalen the lady wrote she had just returned to st algebra from her sister ’s funeral “ euphemia had never been the same after breaking that hip” as to the matter of mrs humbert’ s daughter  she wished to report that it was too late to enroll her this year but that she the surviving phale n was practically certain that if mr and mrs humbert brought dolores over in january  her admittance might be arranged next day after lunch i went to see “our” doctor  a friendly fellow whose perfect bedside manner and complete reliance on a few patented drugs adequately mask ed his ignorance of and indifference to medi cal science the fact that lo would have to come back to ramsdale was a treasure of anticipation for this event i wanted to be fully prepared i had in fact begun my campaign earlier  before charlotte made that cruel decision of hers i had to be sure when my lovely child arrived that very night and then night after night until st algebra took her away from me i would possess the means of putting two creatures to sleep so thoroughly that neither sound nor touch should rouse them throughout most of july i had been experimenting with various sleeping powders trying them out on charlotte a great taker of pills the last dose i had given her she thought it was a tablet of mild bromides— to anoint her nerves had knoc ked her out for four solid hours i had put the radio at full blast i had blazed in her face an olisboslike flashlight i had pushed her pinched her prodded her—and nothing had disturbed the rhythm of her calm and powerfu l breathing however  when i had done such a simple thing as kiss her she had awakened at once as fresh and strong as an octopus i barely escaped this would not do i thought had to get something still safer  at first dr byron did not seem to believe me when i said his last prescription was no match for my insomnia he suggested i try again and for a moment diverted my attention by showing me photographs of his family  he had a fascinating child of dolly’ s age but i saw through his tricks and insisted he prescribe the mightiest pill extant he suggested i play golf but finally agreed to giveme something that he said “would really work” and going to a cabinet he produced a vial of violetblue capsules banded with dark purple at one end which he said had just been placed on the market and were intended not for neurotics whom a draft of water could calm if properly administered but only for great sleepless artists who had to die for a few hours in order to live for centuries i love to fool doctors and though inwardly rejoicing pocketed the pills with a skeptical shrug incidentally  i had had to be careful with him once in another connection a stupid lapse on my part made me mention my last sanatorium and i thought i saw the tips of his ears twitch being not at all keen for charlotte or anybody else to know that period of my past i had hastily explained that i had once done some research among the insane for a novel but no matter the old rogue certainly had a sweet girleen i left in great spirits steering my wife’ s car with one finger  i contentedly rolled homewar d ramsdale had after all lots of charm the cicadas whirred the avenue had been freshly watered smoothly  almo st silkily  i turned down into our steep little street everything was somehow so right that day so blue and green i knew the sun shone because my ignition key was reflected in the windshield and i knew it was exactly half past three because the nurse who came to massage miss opposite every afternoon was tripping down the narrow sidewalk in her white stockings and shoes as usual junk’s hysterical setter attacked me as i rolled downhill and as usual the local paper was lying on the porch where it had just been hurled by kenny  the day before i had ended the regime of aloofness i had impo sed upon myself and now uttered a cheerful homecoming call as i opened the door of the living room with her creamwhite nape and bronze bun to me wearing the yellow blouse and maroon slacks she had on when i first met her charlotte sat at the corner bureau writing a letter  my hand still on the doorknob i repeated my hearty cry her writing hand stopped she sat still for a moment then she slowly turned in her chair and rested her elbow on its curved back her face disfigured by her emotion was not a pretty sight as she stared at my legs and said “the haze wom an the big bitch  the old cat the obnoxious mamma the —the old stupid haze is no longer your dupe she has—she has …” my fair accuser stopped swallowing her venom and her tears whatever humbert humbert said—or attempted to say—is inessential she went on“you’re a monster  you’re a detestable abominable criminal fraud if you come near—i’ll scream out the window  get back” again whatever hh murmured may be omitted i think “i am leaving tonight this is all yours only you’ll never  never see that miserable brat again get out of this room” reader  i did i went up to the exsemistudio arms akimbo i stood for a moment quite still and selfcom posed surveying from the threshold the raped little table with its open drawer  a key hanging from the lock four other household keys on the table top i walked across the landing into the humberts’ bedroom and calmly removed my diary from under her pillow into my pocket then i started to walk downstairs but stopped halfway she was talking on the telephone which happened to be plugged just outside the door of the living room i wante d to hear what she was saying she canceled an order for something or other  and returned to the parlor  i rearranged my respiration and went through the hallway to the kitchen there i opened a bottle of scotch  she could never resist scotch then i walk ed into the dining room and from there through the halfopen door contemplated charlotte’ s broad back “you are ruining my life and yours” i said quietly  “let us be civilized people it is all your hallucinatio n you are crazy  charlotte the notes you found were fragments of a nove l your name and hers were put in by mere chance just because they came handy  think it over i shall bring you a drink” she neither answered nor turned but went on writing in a scorching scrawl whatever she was writing a third letter  presumably two in stamped envelopes were already laid out on the desk i went back to the kitchen i set out two glasses to st algebra to lo and opened the refrigerator  it roared at me viciously while i removed the ice from its heart rewrite let her read it again she will not recall details change forge write a fragment and show it to her or leave it lying around why do faucets sometimes whine so horribly a horrible situation really  the little pillow shaped blocks of ice—pillows for polar teddy bear lo—emitted rasping crackling tortured sounds as the warm water loosened them in their cells i bumped down the glasses side by side i poured in the whiskey and a dram of soda she had tabooed my pin bark and bang went the icebox carrying the glasses i walked through the dining room and spoke through the parlor door which was a fraction ajar  not quite space enough for my elbow “i have made you a drink” i said she did not answer  the mad bitch and i placed the glasses on the sideboard near the telephone which had started to ring “leslie speaking  leslie tomson” said leslie tomson who favored a dip at dawn “mrs humbert sir has been run over and you’d better come quick” i answered perhaps a bit testily  that my wife was safe and sound and still holding the receiver  i pushed open the door and said “there’ s this man saying you’ve been killed charlotte” but there was no charlotte in the living room  i rushed out the far side of our steep little street presented a peculiar sight a big black glossy packard had climbed miss opposite’ s sloping lawn at an angle from the sidewalk where a tartan laprobe had dropped in a heap and stood there shining in the sun its doors open like wings its front wheels deep in evergreen shrubbery  to the anatomical right of this car on the trim turf of the lawnslope an old gentleman with a white mustache well dressed—doublebreasted gray suit polkadotted bowtie—lay supine his long legs togeth er like a deathsize wax figure i have to put the impact of an instantaneou s vision into a sequence of words their physical accumulation in the page impairs the actual flash the sharp unity of impression rugheap car old mandoll miss o’s nurse running with a rustle a halfempty tumbler in her hand back to the screened porch—where the proppedup imprisoned decrepit lady herself may be imagined screeching but not loud enough to drown the rhythmical yaps of the junk setter walking from group to group—from a bunch of neighbors already collected on the sidewalk near the bit of checked stuff and back to the car which he had finally run to earth and then to another group on the lawn consisting of leslie two police men and a sturdy man with tortoise shell glasses at this point i should explain that the prompt appearance of the patrolmen hardly more than a minute after the accident was due to their having been ticketing the illegally parked cars in a cross lane two blocks down the grade that the fellow with the glasses was frederic k beale jr driver of the packard that his year old father  whom the nurse had just watered on the green bank where he lay—a banked banker so to speak— was not in a dead faint but was comfortably and methodically recovering from a mild heart attack or its possibility and finally  that the laprobe on the sidew alk where she had so often pointed out to me with disapproval the crooked green cracks concealed the mangled remains of charlotte humbert who had been knocked down and dragged several feet by the beale car as she was hurrying across the street to drop three letters in the mailbox at the corner of miss opposite’ s lawn these were picked up and handed to me bya pretty child in a dirty pink frock and i got rid of them by clawing them to fragments in my trouser pocket three doctors and the farlows presently arrived on the scene and took over the widower  a man of exceptional selfcontrol neither wept nor raved he staggered a bit that he did but he opened his mouth only to impart such information or issue such directions as were strictl y necessary in connection with the identific ation examination and disposa l of a dead woman the top of her head a porridge of bone brains bronze hair and blood the sun was still a blinding red when he was put to bed in dolly’ s room by his two friends gentle john and dewyeyed jean who to be near retired to the humberts’ bedroo m for the night which for all i know  they may not have spent as innocently as the solemnity of the occasion required i have no reason to dwell in this very special memoir  on the prefuneral formalities that had to be attend ed to or on the funeral itself which was as quiet as the marriage had been but a few incidents pertaining to those four or five days after charlotte’ s simple death have to be noted my first night of widowhood i was so drunk that i slept as soun dly as the child who had slept in that bed next morning i hastened to inspect the fragments of letters in my pocket they had got too thoroughly mixed up to be sorted into three complete sets i assumed that “… and you had better find it because i cannot buy …” came from a letter to lo and other fragments seemed to point to charlotte’ s intention of fleeing with lo to parkington or even back to pisky  lest the vulture snatch her precious lamb other tatters and shreds never had i thought i had such strong talons obviously referred to an application not to st a but to another boarding school which was said to be so harsh and gray and gaunt in its methods although supplying croquet under the elms as to have earned the nickname of “reformatory for young ladies” finally  the third epistle was obviously addressed to me i made out such items as “… after a year of separation we may …” “… oh my dearest oh my …” “… worse than if it had been a woman you kept …” “… or maybe i shall die …” but on the whole my gleanings made little sense the various fragments of those three hasty missives were as jumbled in the palms of my hands as their elements had been in poor charlotte’ s head that day john had to see a customer  and jean had to feed her dogs and so i was to be deprived temporarily of my friends’ company  the dear people were afraid i might commit suicide if left alone and since no otherfriends were available miss opposite was incommunicado the mccoos were busy building a new house miles away  and the chatfields had been recently called to maine by some family trouble of their own leslie and louise were commissioned to keep me company under the pretense of helping me to sort out and pack a multitude of orphaned things in a moment of superb inspiration i showed the kind and credulous farlows we were waiting for leslie to come for his paid tryst with louise a little photograph of charlotte i had found among her affairs from a boulder she smiled through blown hair it had been taken in april  a memorable spring while on a business visit to the states i had had occasion to spend several months in pisky  we met—and had a mad love affair i was married alas and she was engaged to haze but after i returned to europe we corresponded through a friend now dead jean whispered she had heard some rumors and looked at the snapshot and still looking handed it to john and john removed his pipe and looked at lovely and fast charlotte becker  and handed it back to me then they left for a few hours happy louise was gur gling and scolding her swain in the basement hardly had the farlows gone than a bluechinned cleric called—and i tried to make the interview as brief as was consistent with neither hurting his feelings nor arousing his doubts yes i would devote all my life to the child’ s welfare here incidenta lly was a little cross that charlotte becker had given me when we were both young i had a female cousin a respectable spinster in new york there we would find a good private school for dolly  oh what a crafty humbert for the benefit of leslie and louise who might and did report it to john and jean i made a tremendously loud and beautifully enacted longdistance call and simulated a conversat ion with shirley holmes when john and jean returned i completely took them in by telling them in a deliberately wild and confus ed mutter  that lo had gone with the intermedia te group on a fiveday hike and could not be reached “good lord” said jean “what shall we do” john said it was perfectly simple—he would get the climax police to find the hikers—it would not take them an hour in fact he knew the country and— “look” he continued “why don’t i drive there right now and you may sleep with jean”—he did not really add that but jean supported his offer so passionately that it might be impliedi broke down i pleaded with john to let things remain the way they were i said i could not bear to have the child all around me sobbing  clinging to me she was so highstrung the experience might react on her future psychiatrists have analyzed such cases there was a sudden pause “well you are the doctor ” said john a little bluntly  “but after all i was charlotte’ s friend and adviser  one would like to know what you are going to do about the child anyway ” “john” cried jean “she is his child not harold haze’ s don’t you understand humbert is dolly’ s real father ” “i see” said john “i am sorry  yes i see i did not realize that it simplifies matters of course and whatever you feel is right” the distraught father went on to say he would go and fetch his delicate daughter immediately after the funeral and would do his best to give her a good time in totally dif ferent surroundings perhaps a trip to new mexico or california—granted of course he lived so artistically did i impersonat e the calm of ultimate despair  the hush before some crazy outburst that the perfect farlows removed me to their house they had a good cellar  as cellars go in this country and that was helpful for i feared insomnia and a ghost now i must explain my reasons for keeping dolores away  naturally  at first when char lotte had just been eliminated and i reentered the house a free father and gulped down the two whiskeyandsodas i had prepared and topped them with a pint or two of my “pin” and went to the bathroom to get away from neighbors and friends there was but one thing in my mind and pulse—namely  the awaren ess that a few hours hence warm brown haired and mine mine mine lolita would be in my arms shedding tears that i would kiss away faster than they could well but as i stood wideeyed and flushed before the mirror  john farlow tenderly tapped to inquire if i was okay—and i immediately realized it would be madness on my part to have her in the house with all those busybodies milling around and scheming to take her away from me indeed unpredictable lo herself might —who knows—show some foolish distrust of me a sudden repugnance vague fear and the like—and gone would be the magic prize at the very instant of triumph speaking of busybodies i had another visitor—friend beale the fellow who eliminated my wife stodgy and solemn looking like a kind of assistant executioner  with his bulldog jowls small black eyes thicklyrimmed glasses and conspicuous nostrils he was ushered in by john who then left us closing the door upon us with the utmost tact suavely saying he had twins in my stepdaughter ’s class my grotesque visitor unrolled a large diagram he had made of the accident it was as my stepdaughter would have put it “a beaut” with all kinds of impressive arrow s and dotted lines in varicolored inks mrs h h’s trajectory was illustrated at several points by a series of those little outline figures—dolllike wee career girl or wac—used in statistics as visual aids very clearly and conclusively  this route came into contact with a boldly traced sinuous line representing two consecutive swerves—one which the beale car made to avoid the junk dog dog not shown  and the second  a kind of exaggerated continu ation of the first meant to avert the tragedy  a very black cross indicated the spot where the trim little outline figure had at last come to rest on the sidewalk i looked for some similar mark to denote the place on the embankment where my visitor’s huge wax father had reclined but there was none that gentleman however had signed the document as a witness underneath the name of leslie t omson miss opposite and a few other people with his hummingbird pencil deftly and delicately flying from one point to another  frederick demonstrated his absolute innocence and the recklessness of my wife while he was in the act of avoiding the dog she had slipped on the freshly watered asphalt and plunged forward whereas she should have flung herself not forward but backward fred showed how by a jerk of his padded shoulder i said it was certainly not his fault and the inquest upheld my view  breathing violen tly through jetblack tense nostrils he shook his head and my hand then with an air of perfect savoir vivre and gentlemanly generosity  he offered to pay the funeralhome expenses he expected me to refuse his offer with a drunken sob of gratitude i accepted it this took him aback slowly  incredulously  he repeated what he had said i thanked him again even more profusely than before in resul t of that weird intervie w the numbness of my soul was for a moment resolved and no wonder i had actually seen the agent of fate i had palpated the very flesh of fate—and its padded shoulder  a brilliant and monstrous mutation had suddenly taken place and here was the instrument within the intricacies of the pattern hurrying housewife slippery pavement a pest of a dog steep grade big car baboon at its wheel i could dimly distinguish my own vile contribution had i not been such a fool—orsuch an intuitive genius—to preserve that journal fluids produced by vindictive anger and hot shame would not have blinded char lotte in her dash to the mailbox but even had they blinded her still nothing might have happened had not precise fate that synchronizing phantom mixed within its alembic the car and the dog and the sun and the shade and the wet and the weak and the strong and the stone adieu marlene fat fate’s formal handshake as reproduced by beale before leaving the room brought me out of my torpor and i wept ladies and gentlemen of the jury—i wept  the elms and the poplars were turning their ruffled backs to a sudden onslaught of wind and a black thunderhead loomed above ramsdale’ s white church tower when i looked around me for the last time for unknown adven tures i was leaving the livid house where i had rented a room only ten weeks before the shades—thrifty  practical bamboo shades —were already down on porches or in the house their rich textures lend modern drama the house of heaven must seem pretty bare after that a raindrop fell on my knuckles i went back into the house for something or other while john was putting my bags into the car and then a funny thing happened i do not know if in these tragic notes i have sufficien tly stressed the peculiar “sending” effect that the writer ’s good looks—pseudo celtic attractively simian boyishly manly—had on women of every age and environment of course such announcements made in the first person may sound ridiculous but every once in a while i have to remind the reader of my appearance much as a profe ssional novelist who has given a character of his some mannerism or a dog has to go on producing that dog or that mannerism every time the character crops up in the course of the book there may be more to it in the present case my gloomy good looks should be kept in the mind’ s eye if my story is to be properly understood pubescent lo swooned to hum bert’s charm as she did to hiccuppy music adult lotte loved me with a mature possessive passion that i now deplore and respect more than i care to say jean farlow  who was thirtyone and absolutely neuro tic had also apparently developed a strong liking for me she was handsome in a carvedindian sort of way with a burnt sienna complexion her lips were like large crimson polyps and when she emitted her special barking laugh she showed lar ge dull teeth and pale gums she was very tall wore either slacks with sandals or billowing skirts with ballet slippers drank any strong liquor in any amount had had two miscarriages wrote stories about animals painted as the reader knows lakescapes was already nursing the cancer that was to kill her at thirty three and was hopelessly unattractive to me judge then of my alarm whena few seconds before i left she and i stood in the hallway jean with her always trembling fingers took me by the temples and tears in her bright blue eyes attempted unsuccessfully  to glue herself to my lips “take care of yourself” she said “kiss your daughter for me” a clap of thunder reverberated throughout the house and she added “perhaps somewhere some day at a less miserable time we may see each other again” jean whatever  wherever you are in minus timespace or plus soultime for give me all this parenthesis included and presently i was shaking hands with both of them in the street the sloping street and everything was whirling and flying before the approaching white deluge and a truck with a mattress from philadelphia was confidently rolling down to an empty house and dust was running and writhing over the exact slab of stone where charlotte when they lifted the laprobe for me had been revealed curled up her eyes intact their black lashes still wet matted like yours lolita  one might suppose that with all blocks removed and a prospect of delirious and unlimited delights before me i would have mentally sunk back heaving a sigh of delicious relief eh bien pas du tout instead of basking in the beams of smiling chance i was obsessed by all sorts of purely ethical doubts and fears for instance might it not surprise people that lo was so consistently debarred from attending festive and funeral functions in her immediate famil y you remember—we had not had her at our wedding or another thing granted it was the long hairy arm of coincidence that had reached out to remove an innocent woman might coincidence not ignore in a heathen moment what its twin lamb had done and hand lo a premature note of commiseration true the accident had been reported only by the ramsdale journal —not by the parkington recor der or the climax herald  camp q being in another state and local deaths having no federal news interest but i could not help fancying that somehow dolly haze had been informed already  and that at the very time i was on my way to fetch her she was being driven to ramsdale by friends unknown to me still more disquieting than all these conjectures and worries was the fact that humbert humbert a brandnew american citizen of obscure european origin had taken no steps towa rd becoming the legal guardian of his dead wife’ s daughter twelve years and seven months old would i ever dare take those steps i could not repress a shiver whenever i imagined my nudity hemmed in by mysterious statutes in the merciless glare of the common law  my scheme was a marvel of primitive art i would whizz over to camp q tell lolita her mother was about to under go a major operation at an invented hospita l and then keep moving with my sleepy nymphet from inn to inn while her mother got better and better and finally died but as i traveled campw ard my anxiety grew  i could not bear to think i might not find lolita there—or find instead another  scared lolita clamoring for some family friend not the farlows thank god—she hardly knew them— but might there not be other people i had not reckoned with finally  idecided to make the longdistance call i had simulated so well a few days before it was raining hard when i pulled up in a muddy suburb of parkington just before the fork  one prong of which bypassed the city and led to the highway which cross ed the hills to lake climax and camp q i flipped off the ignition and for quite a minute sat in the car bracing myself for that telephone call and staring at the rain at the inundated sidewalk at a hydrant a hideous thing really  painted a thick silver and red extending the red stumps of its arms to be varnished by the rain which like stylized blood dripped upon its argent chains no wonder that stopping beside those nightmare cripp les is taboo i drove up to a gasoline station a surprise awaited me when at last the coins had satisfactorily clanked down and a voice was allowed to answer mine holmes the camp mistress informed me that dolly had gone monday this was wednesday on a hike in the hills with her group and was expected to return rather late today  would i care to come tomorrow  and what was exactly—w ithout going into details i said that her mother was hospitalized that the situation was grave that the child should not be told it was grave and that she should be ready to leave with me tomorrow afternoon the two voices parte d in an explosion of warmth and good will and through some freak mechan ical flaw all my coins came tumbling back to me with a hittingthejackpot clatter that almost made me laugh despite the disappointment at having to postpone bliss one wonders if this sudden dischar ge this spasmodic refund was not correlated somehow  in the mind of mcfate with my having invented that little expedition before ever learning of it as i did now  what next i proceeded to the business center of parkington and devoted the whole afternoon the weather had cleared the wet town was like silver  andglass to buying beautiful things for lo goodness what crazy purchases were prompted by the poignant predilection humbert had in those days for check weaves bright cottons frills puffedout short sleeves soft pleats snugfitting bodices and generously full skirts oh lolita you are my girl as vee was poe’s and bea dante’ s and what little girl would not like to whirl in a circular skirt and scanties did i have something special in mind coaxing voices asked me swimming suits we have them in all shades dream pink frosted aqua glans mauve tulip red oolala black what about playsuits slips no slips lo and i loathed slipsone of my guides in these matters was an anthropometric entry made by her mother on lo’s twelfth birthday the reader remembers that know yourchild book i had the feeling that charlotte moved by obscure motives of envy and dislike had added an inch here a pound there but since the nymph et had no doubt grown somewhat in the last seven months i though t i could safely accept most of those january measurements hip girth twentyni ne inches thigh girth just below the gluteal sulcus seventeen calf girth and neck circumference eleven chest circumference twentyseven upper arm girth eight waist twentythree stature fifty seven inches weight seventy eight pounds figure linear intelligence quotient  vermiform appendix present thank god apart from measurements i could of course visualize lolita with hallucinational lucidity and nursing as i did a tingle on my breastbone at the exact spot her silky top had come level once or twice with my heart and feeling as i did her warm weight in my lap so that in a sense i was always “with lolita” as a woman is “with child” i was not surprised to discover later that my computation had been more or less correct having moreover studied a midsummer sale book it was with a very knowing air that i examined variou s pretty articles sport shoes sneakers pumps of crushed kid for crushed kids the painted girl in black who attended to all these poignant needs of mine turned parental scholarship and precise description into commercia l euphemisms such as “petite” another  much older woman in a white dress with a pancake makeup seemed to be oddly impressed by my knowledge of junior fashions perhaps i had a midget for mistress so when shown a skirt with two “cute” pockets in front i intentionally put a naïve male question and was rewarded by a smiling demonstration of the way the zipper worked in the back of the skirt i had next great fun with all kinds of shorts and briefs—phantom little lolitas dancing falling daisying all over the counter  we rounded up the deal with some prim cotton pajamas in popular butcher boy style humbert the popular butcher  there is a touch of the mythological and the enchanted in those large stores where according to ads a career girl can get a complete desktodate wardrobe and where little sister can dream of the day when her wool jersey will make the boys in the back row of the classroom drool lifesize plastic figures of snubbednosed children with duncolored greenish brown dotted faunish faces floated around me i realized i was the only shopper inthat rather eerie place where i moved about fishlike in a glaucous aquarium i sensed strange thoughts form in the minds of the languid ladies that escorted me from counter to counter  from rock ledge to seaweed and the belts and the bracelets i chose seemed to fall from siren hands into transparent wate r i bought an elegant valise had my purchases put into it and repaired to the nearest hotel well pleased with my day  somehow  in connection with that quiet poetical afternoon of fastidious shopping i recalled the hotel or inn with the seductive name of the enchanted hunters which charlotte had happened to mention shortly before my liberation w ith the help of a guidebook i located it in the secluded town of briceland a four hour drive from lo’ s camp i could have telephoned but fearing my voice might go out of control and lapse into coy croaks of broken english i decided to send a wire ordering a room with twin beds for the next night what a comic clumsy  wavering prince charming i was how some of my readers will laugh at me when i tell them the trouble i had with the wording of my telegram what should i put humbert and daughter humber g and small daughter homber g and immature girl hombur g and child the droll mistake—the “g” at the end—which eventually came through may have been a telepathic echo of these hesitations of mine and then in the velvet of a summer night my broodings over the philter i had with me oh mise rly hambur g was he not a very enchanted hunter as he deliberate d with himself over his boxful of magic ammunition to rout the monste r of insomnia should he try himself one of those amethyst capsules there were forty of them all told—forty nights with a frail little sleeper at my throbbing side could i rob myself of one such night in order to sleep  certainly not much too precious was each tiny plum each microscopic planetarium with its live stardust oh let me be mawkish for the nonce i am so tired of being cynical  this daily headache in the opaq ue air of this tombal jail is distu rbing but i must persevere have written more than a hundred pages and not got anywhere yet my calendar is getting confused that must have been around august   don’ t think i can go on heart head—everything lolita lolita lolita lolita lolita lolita lolita lolita lolita repeat till the page is full printer   still in parkington finally  i did achieve an hour’s slumber—from which i was aroused by gratuitous and horribly exhausting congress with a small hairy hermaphro dite a total stranger  by then it was six in the morning and it suddenly occurred to me it might be a good thing to arrive at the camp earlier than i had said from parkington i had still a hundred miles to go and there would be more than that to the hazy hills and briceland if i had said i would come for dolly in the afternoon it was only becau se my fancy insisted on merciful night fallin g as soon as possible upon my impatience but now i foresaw all kinds of misunderstandings and was all ajitter lest delay might give her the opportunity of some idle teleph one call to ramsdale however  when at  am i attempted to start i was confronted by a dead battery  and noon was nigh when at last i left parkington i reache d my destination around half past two parked my car in a pine grove where a greenshirted redheaded impish lad stood throwing horseshoes in sullen solitude was laconically directed by him to an of fice in a stucco cottage in a dying state had to endure for several minutes the inquisitive comm iseration of the camp mistress a sluttish worn out female with rusty hair  dolly she said was all packed and ready to go she knew her mother was sick but not critically  would mr haze i mean mr humbert care to meet the camp counsellors or look at the cabins where the girls live each dedic ated to a disne y creature or visit the lodge  or should charlie be sent over to fetch her the girls were just finishing fixing the dining room for a dance and perhaps afterwards she would say to somebody or other “the poor guy looked like his own ghost” let me retain for a moment that scene in all its trivial and fateful detail hag holmes writing out a receip t scratching her head pulling a drawer out of her desk pouring change into my impatient palm then neatly spreading a banknote over it with a bright “… and five” photographs of girlchildren some gaudy moth or butterfly  still alive safely pinned to the wall “nature study” the framed diploma of the camp’ s dietitian my trembling hands acard produced by efficient holm es with a report of dolly haze’ s behavior for july “fair to good keen on swimming and boating” a sound of trees and birds and my pounding heart … i was standing with my back to the open door and then i felt the blood rush to my head as i heard her respiration and voice behind me she arrived dragging and bumping her heavy suitcase “hi” she said and stood still looking at me with sly glad eyes her soft lips parted in a slightly foolish but wonderfull y endearing smile she was thinner and taller  and for a second it seemed to me her face was less pretty than the mental imprint i had cherished for more than a month her cheeks looked hollowed and too much lentigo camoufl aged her rosy rustic features and that first impression a very narrow human interval between two tiger heartbeats carried the clear implication that all widower humbert had to do wanted to do or would do was to give this wan looking though suncolored little orphan aux yeux battus and even those plumbaceous umbrae under her eyes bore freckles a sound education a healthy and happy girlhood a clean home nice girlfriends of her age among whom if the fates deigned to repay me i might find perhaps a pretty little mägdlein for herr dokto r humbert alone but “in a wink” as the germans say the angelic line of conduct was erased and i overtook my prey time move s ahead of our fancies and she was my lolita again—in fact more of my lolita than ever i let my hand rest on her warm auburn head and took up her bag she was all rose and honey  dressed in her brightest gingha m with a pattern of little red apples and her arms and legs were of a deep golden brown with scratches like tiny dotted lines of coagulated rubies and the ribbed cuf fs of her white socks were turned down at the remember ed level and because of her childish gait or because i had memorized her as always wearing heelless shoes her saddle oxfords looked somehow too large and too highheeled for her goodbye cam p q merry camp q goodbye plain unwh olesome food goodbye charlie boy in the hot car she settled down beside me slapped a prompt fly on her lovely knee then her mouth working violently on a piece of chewing gum she rapidly cranked down the window on her side and settled back again we sped through the striped and speckled forest “how’ s mother” she asked dutifully  i said the doctor s did not quite know yet what the trouble was anyway  something abdominal abominable no abdominal we would have tohang around for a while the hospital was in the country  near the gay town of lepingville where a great poet had resided in the early nineteenth century and where we would take in all the shows she thought it a peachy idea and wondered if we could make lepingville before nine pm “we should be at briceland by dinner time” i said “and tomorrow we’ll visit lepingville  how was the hike did you have a marvelous time at the camp” “uhhuh” “sorry to leave” “unun” “talk lo—don’ t grunt t ell me something” “what thing dad” she let the word expand with ironic deliberation “any old thing” “okay  if i call you that” eyes slit at the road “quite” “it’s a sketch you know  when did you fall for my mummy” “some day lo you will unders tand many emotions and situations such as for example the harmony  the beauty of spiritual relationship” “bah” said the cynical nymphet shallow lull in the dialogue filled with some landscape “look lo at all those cows on that hillside” “i think i’ll vomit if i look at a cow again” “you know  i missed you terribly  lo” “i did not fact i’ve been revoltingly unfaithful to you but it does not matter one bit because you’ve stopped caring for me anyway  you drive much faster than my mummy  mister ” i slowed down from a blind seventy to a purblind fifty  “why do you think i have ceased caring for you lo” “well you haven’ t kissed me yet have you” inly dying inly moaning i glimpsed a reasonably wide shoulder of road ahead and bumped and wobbled into the weeds remember she is only a child remember she is only— hardly had the car come to a standstill than lolita positively flowed into my arms not daring not daring let myself go—not even daring let myself realize that this sweet wetness and trembling fire was the beginning of the ineffable life which ably assiste d by fate i had finally willed into being— not daring really kiss her i touched her hot opening lips with the utmostpiety  tiny sips nothing salaci ous but she with an impatie nt wriggle pressed her mouth to mine so hard that i felt her big front teeth and shared in the peppermint taste of her saliva i knew  of course it was but an innocent game on her part a bit of backfisch foolery in imitation of some simulacrum of fake romance and since as the psychotherapist as well as the rapist will tell you the limits and rules of such girlish games are fluid or at least too childishly subtle for the senior partner to grasp—i was dreadfully afraid i might go too far and cause her to start back in revulsion and terro r and as above all i was agonizingly anxious to smuggle her into the hermetic seclusion of the enchanted hunters and we had still eighty miles to go blessed intuition broke our embrace—a split second before a highway patrol car drew up alongside florid and beetlebrowed its driver stared at me “happen to see a blue sedan same make as yours pass you before the junction” “why  no” “we didn’t” said lo eagerly leaning across me her innocent hand on my legs “but are you sure it was blue because—” the cop  what shadow of us was he after  gave the little colleen his best smile and went into a uturn we drove on “the fruithead” remarked lo “he should have nabbed you” “why me for heaven’ s sake” “well the speed in this bum state is fifty and—no don’t slow down you dull bulb he’ s gone now ” “we have still quite a stretch” i said “and i want to get there before dark so be a good girl” “bad bad girl” said lo comfort ably “juvenile delickwent but frank and fetching that light was red i’ve never seen such driving” we rolled silently through a silent townlet “say  wouldn’ t mother be absolutely mad if she found out we were lovers” “good lord lo let us not talk that way ” “but we are lovers aren’ t we” “not that i know of i think we are going to have some more rain don’ t you want to tell me of those little pranks of yours in camp” “you talk like a book dad”“what have you been up to i insist you tell me” “are you easily shocked” “no go on” “let us turn into a secluded lane and i’ll tell you” “lo i must seriously ask you not to play the fool w ell” “well—i joined in all the activities that were of fered” “ensuite” “ansooit i was taught to live happily and richly with others and to develop a wholesome personality  be a cake in fact” “yes i saw something of the sort in the booklet” “we loved the sings around the fire in the big stone fireplace or under the darned stars where every girl merged her own spirit of happin ess with the voice of the group” “your memory is excellent lo but i must trouble you to leave out the swear words anything else” “the girl scout’ s motto” said lo rhapsodically  “is also mine i fill my life with worthwhile deeds such as—well never mind what my duty is—to be useful i am a friend to male animals i obey orders i am cheerful that was another police car i am thrifty and i am absolutely filthy in thought word and deed” “now i do hope that’ s all you witty child” “yep that’ s all no—wait a sec we baked in a reflector oven isn’t that terrific” “well that’ s better ” “we washed zillions of dishes “zillions’ you know is schoo lmarm’ s slang for manymanymanyman y oh yes last but not least as mother says —now let me see—what was it i know we made shadowgraphs gee what fun” “c’est bien tout” “c’est  except for one little thing something i simply can’t tell you without blushing all over ” “will you tell it me later” “if we sit in the dark and you let me whisper  i will do you sleep in your old room or in a heap with mother” “old room your mother may have to under go a very serious operation lo” “stop at that candy bar  will you” said lositting on a high stool a band of sunlight crossing her bare brown forearm lolita was served an elaborate icecream concoction topped with synthetic syrup it was erected and brought her by a pimply brute of a boy in a greasy bowtie who eyed my fragile child in her thin cotton frock with carnal deliberation my impatience to reach briceland and the enchanted hunters was becoming more than i could endure fortu nately she dispatched the stuf f with her usual alacrity  “how much cash do you have” i asked “not a cent” she said sadly  lifting her eyebrows showing me the empty inside of her money purse “this is a matter that will be mended in due time” i rejoined archly  “are you coming” “say  i wonder if they have a washroom” “you are not going there” i said firmly  “it is sure to be a vile place do come on” she was on the whole an obedie nt little girl and i kissed her in the neck when we got back into the car  “don’ t do that” she said looking at me with unfeigned surprise “don’ t drool on me y ou dirty man” she rubbed the spot against her raised shoulder  “sorry ” i murmured “i’m rather fond of you that’ s all” we drove under a gloomy sky  up a winding road then down again “well i’m also sort of fond of you” said lolita in a delayed soft voice with a sort of sigh and sort of settled closer to me oh my lolita we shall never get there dusk was beginning to saturate pretty little briceland its phony colonial architecture curiosity shops and imported shade trees when we drove through the weakly lighted stree ts in search of the enchanted hunters the air despite a steady drizzle beading it was warm and green and a queue of people mainly children and old men had already formed before the box office of a movie house dripping with jewelfires “oh i want to see that picture let’ s go right after dinner  oh let’ s” “we might” chanted humbert—knowing perfectly well the sly tumescent devil that by nine when his show began she would be dead in his arms “easy” cried lo lurching forward as an accursed truck in front of us its backside carbuncles pulsating stopped at a crossingif we did not get to the hotel soon immediately  miraculously  in the very next block i felt i would lose all control over the haze jalopy with its ineffectual wipe rs and whimsical brakes but the passersby i applied to for directions were either strange rs themselves or asked with a frown “enchanted what” as if i were a madman or else they went into such complicated explanations with geometrical gestures geographical generalities and strictly local clues … then bear south after you hit the courthouse … that i could not help losing my way in the maze of their wellmeaning gibberish lo whose lovely prismatic entrails had already digested the sweetmeat was looking forward to a big meal and had begun to fidget  as to me although i had long become used to a kind of secondary fate mcfate’ s inept secretary  so to speak pettily interfering with the boss’ s generous magnificent plan—to grind and grope through the avenues of briceland was perhaps the most exasperating ordeal i had yet faced in later months i could laugh at my inexperience when recalling the obstinate boyish way in which i had concentrated upon that particular inn with its fancy name for all along our route countless motor courts proclaimed their vacancy in neon lights ready to accommodate salesmen escaped convicts impotents family groups as well as the most corrupt and vigorous couples ah gentle drivers gliding through summer ’s black nights what frolics what twists of lust you might see from your impeccable highways if kumfy kabins were suddenly drained of their pigments and became as transparent as boxes of glass the miracle i hankered for did happen after all a man and a girl more or less conjoined in a dark car under dripping trees told us we were in the heart of the park but had only to turn left at the next traffic light and there we would be we did not see any next traffic light—in fact the park was as black as the sins it concealed—but soon after falling under the smooth spell of a nicely graded curve the travelers became aware of a diamond glow through the mist then a gleam of lakewater appeared—and there it was marvelously and inexorably  under spectral trees at the top of a graveled drive—the pale palace of the enchanted hunters a row of parked cars like pigs at a trough seemed at first sight to forbid access but then by magic a formidable convertible resplendent rubious in the lighted rain came into motion—was energetically backed out by a broadshouldered driver—and we gratefully slipped into the gap it had left i immediately regretted my haste for i noticed that my predecessor had nowtaken advantage of a garagelike shelter nearby where there was ample space for another car but i was too impatient to follow his example “wow looks swank” remarked my vulgar darling squinting at the stucco as she crept out into the audible drizzle and with a childish hand tweaked loose the frockfold that had stuck in the peachcleft—to quote robert browning under the arclights enlar ged replicas of chestnut leaves plunged and played on white pillars i unlocked the trunk compartment a hunchbacked and hoary negro in a uniform of sorts took our bags and wheeled them slowly into the lobby it was full of old ladies and clergymen lolita sank down on her haun ches to caress a palefaced bluefreckled blackeared cocker spaniel swooning on the floral carpet under her hand— as who would not my heart—while i cleared my throat through the throng to the desk there a bald porcine old man—everybody was old in that old hotel—examined my features with a polite smile then leisurely produced my garbled telegram wrestled with some dark doubts turned his head to look at the clock and finally said he was very sorry  he had held the room with the twin beds till half past six and now it was gone a religious convention he said had clashed with a flower show in briceland and —“the name” i said coldly  “is not hum berg and not humbug but herbert i mean humbert and any room will do just put in a cot for my little daughter  she is ten and very tired” the pink old fellow peered goodnaturedly at lo—still squatting listening in profile lips parted to what the dog’s mistress an ancient lady swathed in violet veils was telling her from the depths of a cretonne easy chair  whatever doubts the obscene fellow had they were dispelled by that blossomlike vision he said he might still have a room had one in fact— with a double bed as to the cot— “mr potts do we have any cots left” potts also pink and bald with white hairs growing out of his ears and other holes would see what could be done he came and spoke while i unscrewed my fountain pen impatient humbert “our double beds are really triple” potts cozily said tucking me and my kid in “one crowded night we had three ladies and a child like yours sleep together  i believe one of the ladies was a disguised man my static however—would there be a spare cot in  mr  swine” “i think it went to the swoons” said swine the initial old clown“we’ll manage somehow ” i said “my wife may join us later—but even then i

me” just dynamic not really taking the matter too seriously  “now look here” i said sitting down while she stood a few feet from me and stared at herself contentedly  not unpleasantly surprised at her

door and after carefully peering inside with her strange smoky eyes lest she make another mistake retired to the bathroom i opened the window  tore of f my sweatdrenched shirt changed checked the pill vial in my coat pocket unlocked the— she drifted out i tried to embrace her casually  a bit of controlled tenderness before dinner  she said “look let’ s cut out the kissing game and get something to eat” it was then that i sprang my surprise oh what a dreamy pet she walked up to the open suitcase as if stalking it from afar at a kind of slowmotion walk peering at that distant treasure box on the luggage support was there something wrong i wondered with those great gray eyes of hers or were we both plunged in the same enchanted mist  she stepped up to it lifting her rather highheeled feet rather high and bending her beautiful boyknees while she walked through dilating space with the lentor of one walking under water or in a flight dream then she raised by the armlets a copper colored charmin g and quite expensive vest very slowly stretching it between her silent hands as if she were a bemused birdhunter holding his breath over the incred ible bird he spreads out by the tips of its flaming wings then while i stood waiting for her she pulled out the slow snake of a brilliant belt and tried it on then she crept into my waiting arms radiant relaxed caressing me with her tender  mysterious impure indifferent twilight eyes—for all the world like the cheapest of cheap cuties  for that is what nymphets imitate—while we moan and die “what’ s the katter with misses” i muttered wordcontrol gone into her hair “if you must know ” she said “you do it the wrong way ” “show  wight ray ” “all in good time” responded the spoonerette seva ascendes pulsata brulans kitzelans

might have committed some dreadful blunder fortunately  she returned to the treasure box from the bathroom where it took me quite a time to shift back into normal gear for a humdrum purpose i heard standing drumming retaining my breath my lolita’ s “oo’ s” and “gee’ s” of girlish delight she had used the soap only because it was sample soap “well come on my dear  if you are as hungry as i am” and so to the elevator  daught er swinging her old white purse father walking in front nota bene never behind she is not a lady as we stood now side by side waiting to be taken down she threw back her head yawned without restraint and shook her curls “when did they make you get up at that camp” “halfpast—” she stifled another yawn—“six”—yawn in full with a shiver of all her frame “halfpast” she repeated her throat filling up again the dining room met us with a smell of fried fat and a faded smile it was a spacious and pretentious place with maudlin murals depicting enchanted hunters in various postures and states of enchantment amid a medley of pallid animals dryads and trees a few scattere d old ladies two clergymen and a man in a sports coat were finishing their meals in silence the dining room closed at nine and the greenclad poker faced serving girls were happily  in a desperate hurry to get rid of us “does not he look exactly  but exactly  like quilty” said lo in a soft voice her sharp brown elbow not pointing but visibly burning to point at the lone diner in the loud checks in the far corner of the room “like our fat ramsdale dentist” lo arrested the mouthful of water she had just taken and put down her dancing glass “course not” she said with a splutter of mirth “i meant the writer fellow in the dromes ad” oh fame oh femina when the dessert was plunked down—a huge wedge of cherry pie for the young lady and vanilla ice cream for her protector  most of which she expeditiously added to her pie—i produced a small vial contai ning papa’ s purple pills as i look back at those seasick murals at that strange and monstrous mom ent i can only explain my behavior then by the mechanism of that dream vacuum wherein revolves a deranged mind but at the time it all seemed quite simple and inevitable to me i glanced around satisfiedmyself that the last diner had left removed the stopper  and with the utmost deliberation tipped the philter into my palm i had carefully rehearsed before a mirror the gesture of clapping my empty hand to my open mouth and swallowing a fictitious pill as i expected she pounced upon the vial with its plump beautifully colored capsules loaded with beauty’ s sleep “blue” she exclaimed “v iolet blue what are they made of” “summer skies” i said “and plums and figs and the grapeblood of emperors” “no seriously—please” “oh just purpills vitamin x makes one strong as an ox or an ax want to try one” lolita stretched out her hand nodding vigorously  i had hoped the drug would work fast it certainly did she had had a long long day she had gone rowing in the morning with barbara whose sister was waterfront director  as the adorable accessible nymphet now started to tell me in betwe en suppressed palatehumping yawns growing in volume— oh how fast the magic potion worked—and had been active in other ways too the movie that had vaguely loomed in her mind was of course by the time we watertreaded out of the dining room forgotten as we stood in the elevator  she leaned against me faintly smiling—wouldn’ t you like me to tell you—half closing her darklidded eyes “sleepy  huh” said uncle tom who was bringing up the quiet francoirish gentleman and his daughter as well as two wither ed women experts in roses they looked with sympathy at my frail tanne d tottering dazed rosedarling i had almost to carry her into our room there she sat down on the edge of the bed swaying a little speaking in dovedull longdrawn tones “if i tell you—if i tell you will you promise sleepy  so sleepy—head lolling eyes going out promise you won’ t make complaints” “later  lo now go to bed i’ll leave you here and you go to bed give you ten minutes” “oh i’ve been such a disgusting girl” she went on shaking her hair removing with slow fingers a velvet hair ribbon “lemme tell you—” “tomorrow  lo go to bed go to bed—for goodness sake to bed” i pocketed the key and walked downstairs  gentlewomen of the jury bear with me allow me to take just a tiny bit of your precious time so this was le grand moment  i had left my lolita still sitting on the edge of the abysm al bed drowsily raising her foot fumbling at the shoelaces and showing as she did so the nether side of her thigh up to the crotch of her panties—she had always been singularly absentminded or shameless or both in matters of legshow  this then was the hermetic vision of her which i had locke d in—after satisfying myself that the door carried no inside bolt the key with its numbered dangler of carved wood became forthwit h the weighty sesame to a rapturous and formid able future it was mine it was part of my hot hairy fist in a few minutes—say  twenty  say halfanhour  sicher ist sicher as my uncle gustave used to say—i would let myself into that “” and find my nymphet my beauty and bride emprisone d in her crystal sleep jurors if my happiness could have talked it would have filled that genteel hotel with a deafening roar and my only regret today is that i did not quietly deposit key “” at the office and leave the town the country  the continent the hemisphere— indeed the globe—that very same night let me explain  i was not unduly disturbed by her self accusatory innuendoes i was still firmly resolved to pursue my policy of sparing her purity by opera ting only in the stealth of night only upon a completely anesthetized little nude restraint and reverence were still my motto—even if that “purity” incidentally  thoroughly debunked by modern science had been slightly damaged through some juvenile erotic experienc e no doubt homosexual at that accursed camp of hers of course in my oldfashioned oldworld way i jeanjacques humbert had taken for granted when i first met her that she was as unravi shed as the stereotypical notion of “normal child” had been since the lame nted end of the ancient world bc and its fascinating practices we are not surrounded in our enlighted era by little slave flowers that can be casually plucked between business and bath as they used to be in the days of the romans and we do not as dignified orientals did in still more luxurious times use tiny entertainers fore and aftbetween the mutton and the rose sherbet the whole point is that the old link between the adult world and the child world has been completely severed nowadays by new customs and new laws despite my having dabbled in psychiatry and social work i really knew very little about children after all lolita was only twelve and no matter what concessions i made to time and place—even bearing in mind the crude behavior of american schoolchildren—i still was under the impression that whatever went on among those brash brats went on at a later age and in a different environment therefore to retrieve the thread of this explanation the moralist in me bypassed the issue by clinging to conventiona l notions of what twelveyear old girls should be the child therapist in me a fake as most of them are—but no matter regur gitated neofreudian hash and conjured up a dreaming and exaggerating dolly in the “latency ” period of girlhood finally  the sensualist in me a great and insane monster had no objection to some depravity in his prey but somewhere behind the raging bliss bewildered shadows confe rred—and not to have heeded them this is what i regret human beings attend i should have understood that lolita had already proved to be something quite different from innocent annabel and that the nymphean evil breathing throug h every pore of the fey child that i had prepared for my secret delectation would make the secrecy impossible and the delectation lethal i should have known by the signs made to me by something in lolita—the real child lolita or some haggard angel behind her back that nothing but pain and horror would result from the expected rapture oh winged gentlemen of the jury and she was mine she was mine the key was in my fist my fist was in my pocket she was mine in the course of the evocations and schemes to which i had dedicated so many insomnias i had gradually eliminated all the superfluous blur and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision had evolved a final picture naked except for one sock and her charm bracelet spreadeagled on the bed where my philter had felled her—so i foreglimpsed her a velvet hair ribbon was still clutched in her hand her honeybrown body  with the white negative image of a rudimentary swimsuit patterned against her tan presented to me its pale breastbuds in the rosy lamplig ht a little pubic floss glistened on its plump hillock the cold key with its warm wooden addendum was in my pocket i wande red through various public rooms glory below  gloom above for the look of lust always is gloomy lust is never quite sure—even when thevelvety victim is locked up in one’s dungeon—that some rival devil or influential god may still not abolish one’s prepared triumph in common parlance i needed a drink but there was no barroom in that venerable place full of perspiring philistines and period objects i drifted to the men’ s room there a person in clerical black— a “hearty party” comme on dit—checking with the assistance of vienna if it was still there inquired of me how i had liked dr boyd’ s talk and looked puzzled when i king sigmund the second said boyd was quite a boy upon which i neatly chucked the tissue paper i had been wiping my sensitive finger tips with into the receptacle provided for it and sallied lobbyward comfortably resting my elbows on the counter  i asked mr potts was he quite sure my wife had not telephoned and what about that cot he answered she had not she was dead of course and the cot would be installed tomorr ow if we decid ed to stay on from a big crowded place called the hunters’ hall came a sound of many voices discussing horticulture or eternity  anothe r room called the raspberry room all bathed in light with bright little tables and a large one with “refreshments” was still empty except for a hostess that type of worn woman with a glassy smile and charlotte’ s manner of speaking she floated up to me to ask if i was mr braddo ck because if so miss beard had been looking for me “what a name for a woman” i said and strolled away  in and out of my heart flowed my rainbow blood i would give her till halfpastnine going back to the lobby  i found there a change a number of people in floral dresses or black cloth had formed little groups here and there and some elfish chance offered me the sight of a delightful child of lolita’ s age in lolita’ s type of frock but pure white and there was a white ribbon in her black hair she was not pretty  but she was a nymp het and her ivory pale legs and lily neck formed for one memorable moment a most pleasurable antiphony in terms of spinal music to my desire for lolita brown and pink flushed and fouled the pale child noticed my gaze which was really quite casual and debonair and being ridiculously selfconscious lost countenance completely  rolling her eyes and putting the back of her hand to her cheek and pulling at the hem of her skirt and finally turning her thin mobile shoulder blades to me in specious chat with her cowlike mother  i left the loud lobby and stood outside on the white steps looking at the hundreds of powdered bugs wheeling around the lamps in the soggy blacknight full of ripple and stir all i would do—all i would dare to do—would amount to such a trifle… suddenly i was aware that in the darkness next to me there was somebody sitting in a chair on the pillared porch i could not really see him but what gave him away was the rasp of a screwing off then a discreet gurgle then the final note of a placid screwing on i was about to move away when his voice addressed me “where the devil did you get her” “i beg your pardon” “i said the weather is getting better ” “seems so” “who’ s the lassie” “my daughter ” “you lie—she’ s not” “i beg your pardon” “i said july was hot where’ s her mother” “dead” “i see sorry  by the way why don’t you two lunch with me tomorrow  that dreadful crowd will be gone by then” “we’ll be gone too good night” “sorry  i’m pretty drunk good night that child of yours needs a lot of sleep sleep is a rose as the persians say  smoke” “not now ” he struc k a light but because he was drunk or because the wind was the flame illumined not him but another person a very old man one of those permanent guests of old hotels—and his white rocker  nobody said anything and the darkness returned to its initial place then i heard the old timer cough and deliver himself of some sepulchral mucus i left the porch at least half an hour in all had elapsed i ought to have asked for a sip the strain was beginning to tell if a violin string can ache then i was that string but it would have been unseemly to display any hurry  as i made my way through a constellation of fixed people in one corner of the lobby  there came a blinding flash—and beaming dr braddock two orchidornamentalized matrons the small girl in white and presumably the bared teeth of humbert humbert sidling between the bridelike lassie and the enchanted cleric were immortalized—insofar as the texture and print of smalltown newspapers can be deemed immortal atwittering group had gathered near the elevator  i again chose the stairs  was near the fire escape one could still—but the key was already in the lock and then i was in the room  the door of the lighted bathroom stood ajar in addition to that a skeleton glow came through the veneti an blind from the outside arclights these intercrossed rays penetrated the darkness of the bedroom and revealed the following situation clothed in one of her old nightg owns my lolita lay on her side with her back to me in the middle of the bed her lightly veiled body and bare limbs formed a z she had put both pillows under her dark tousled head a band of pale light crossed her top vertebrae i seemed to have shed my clothes and slipped into pajamas with the kind of fantastic instantaneousness which is implied when in a cinematographic scene the proces s of changing is cut and i had already placed my knee on the edge of the bed when lolita turned her head and stared at me through the striped shadows now this was something the intruder had not expected the whole pill spiel a rather sordid affair entre nous soit dit had had for object a fastness of sleep that a whole regiment would not have disturbed and here she was staring at me and thickly calling me “barbara” barbara wearing my pajamas which were much too tight for her remained poised motionless over the little sleeptalker  softl y with a hopeless sigh dolly turned away  resuming her initial position for at least two minutes i waited and strained on the brink like that tailor with his homemade parachute forty years ago when about to jump from the eiffel tower  her faint breathing had the rhythm of sleep finally i heaved myself onto my narrow margin of bed stealthily pulled at the odds and ends of sheets piled up to the south of my stonecold heels—and lolita lifted her head and gaped at me as i learned later from a helpf ul pharmaceutist the purple pill did not even belong to the big and noble family of barbiturates and though it might have induced sleep in a neurotic who believed it to be a potent drug it was too mild a sedative to affect for any length of time a wary  albeit weary  nymphet wheth er the ramsdale doctor was a charlatan or a shrewd old rogue does not and did not really matter  what mattered was that i hadbeen deceived when lolita opened her eyes again i realized that whether or not the drug might work later in the night the security i had relied upon was a sham one slowly her head turned away and dropped onto her unfair amount of pillow  i lay quite still on my brink peering at her rumpled hair at the glimmer of nymphet flesh where half a haunch and half a shoulder dimly showed and trying to gauge the depth of her sleep by the rate of her respiration some time passed nothing changed and i decided i might risk getting a little closer to that lovely and maddening glimmer but hardly had i moved into its warm purlieus than her breathing was suspended and i had the odious feeling that little dolores was wide awake and would explode in screams if i touched her with any part of my wretchedness please reader no matter your exasperation with the tenderhearted morbidly sensitive infinitely circumspect hero of my book do not skip these essential pages imagine me i shall not exist if you do not imagine me try to discern the doe in me trembling in the forest of my own iniquity let’s even smile a little after all there is no harm in smiling for instance i almost wrote “frinstance” i had no place to rest my head and a fit of heartburn they call those fries “french” grand dieu  was added to my discomfort she was again fast asleep my nymphet but still i did not dare to launch upon my enchanted voyage la petite dormeuse ou l’ama nt ridicule  tomorrow i would stuff her with those earlier pills that had so thoroughly numbed her mummy  in the glove compartment—or in the gladstone bag should i wait a solid hour and then creep up again the science of nympholepsy is a precise scienc e actual contact would do it in one second flat an interspace of a millimeter would do it in ten let us wait there is nothing louder than an american hotel and mind you this was supposed to be a quiet cozy oldfashioned homey place—“gracious living” and all that stuff the clatter of the elevator ’s gate—s ome twenty yards northeast of my head but as clearly perceived as if it were inside my left temple—alternated with the banging and booming of the machine’ s various evolutio ns and lasted well beyond midnight every now and then immediately east of my left ear always assuming i lay on my back not daring to direct my viler side toward the nebulous haunch of my bedmate the corridor would brim with cheerful resonant and inept exclamations ending in a volley of goodnigh ts when that stopped a toilet immediately north of my cerebellum took over it was a manly  energetic deepthroated toilet and it was used many times its gurgle and gush and long afterflowshook the wall behind me then someone in a southern direction was extravagantly sick almost coughing out his life with his liquor and his toilet descended like a veritable niagara immediately beyond our bathroom and when finally all the waterfalls had stopped and the enchanted hunters were sound asleep the avenue under the window of my insomnia to the west of my wake—a staid eminently residenti al dignified alley of huge trees—degenerated into the despicable haunt of gigantic trucks roaring through the wet and windy night and less than six inches from me and my burning life was nebulous lolita after a long stirless vigil my tentacles moved toward s her again and this time the creak of the mattress did not awake her i managed to bring my ravenous bulk so close to her that i felt the aura of her bare shoulder like a warm breath upon my cheek and then she sat up gasped muttered with insane rapidity something about boats tugged at the sheets and lapsed back into her rich dark young unconsciousness as she tossed within that abundant flow of sleep recently auburn at present lunar  her arm struck me across the face for a second i held her she freed herself from the shadow of my embrace —doing this not consciously  not violently  not with any personal distaste but with the neutral plaintive murmur of a child demanding its natural rest and again the situation remaine d the same lolita with her curved spine to humbert humbert resting his head on his hand and burning with desire and dyspepsia the latter necess itated a trip to the bathroom for a draft of water which is the best medicin e i know in my case except perhaps milk with radishes and when i reentered the strange palestriped fastness where lolita’ s old and new clothes reclined in various attitudes of enchantment on pieces of furniture that seemed vaguely afloat my impossible daughter sat up and in clear tones demanded a drink too she took the resilient and cold paper cup in her shadowy hand and gulped down its contents gratefully  her long eyelashes pointing cupward and then with an infantile gesture that carried more charm than any carnal caress little lolita wiped her lips against my shoulder  she fell back on her pillow i had subtracted mine while she drank and was instantly asleep again i had not dared offer her a second helping of the drug and had not abandoned hope that the first might still consolidate her sleep i started to move toward her ready for any disappointment knowing i had better wait but incap able of waiting my pillow smelled of her hair i moved toward myglimmering darling stopping or retreating every time i thought she stirred or was about to stir a breeze from wonderland had begun to affect my thoughts and now they seemed couched in italics as if the surface reflecting them were wrinkled by the phantasm of that breeze time and again my consciousness folded the wrong way my shuffling body entered the sphere of sleep shuffled out again and once or twice i caught myself drifting into a melancholy snore mists of tenderness enfolded mountains of longing now and then it seemed to me that the enchanted prey was about to meet halfway the enchanted hunter  that her haunch was working its way toward me under the soft sand of a remote and fabulous beach and then her dimpled dimnes s would stir and i would know she was farther away from me than ever  if i dwell at some length on the tremors and gropings of that distant night it is because i insist upon proving that i am not and never was and never could have been a brutal scoundrel the gentle and dreamy regions through which i crept were the patrimonies of poets— not crime’ s prowling ground had i reached my goal my ecstasy would have been all softness a case of internal combustion of which she would hardly have felt the heat even if she were wide awake but i still hoped she might gradually be engulfed in a completeness of stupor that would allow me to taste more than a glimmer of her and so in between tentative approximations with a confusion of perception metamorphosing her into eyespo ts of moonlight or a fluffy flowering bush i woul d dream i regained consciousness dream i lay in wait in the first antem eridian hours there was a lull in the restless hotel night then around four the corridor toilet cascaded and its door banged a little after five a reverberating monologue began to arrive in several installments from some courty ard or parking place it was not really a monologue since the speake r stopped every few seconds to listen presumably to another fellow  but that other voice did not reach me and so no real mean ing could be derived from the part heard its matter offact intonations however  helped to bring in the dawn and the room was already suffused with lilac gray when several industrious toilets went to work one after the other  and the clattering and whining elevator began to rise and take down early risers and downers and for some minutes i miserably dozed and charlotte was a mermaid in a greenish tank andsomewhere in the passage dr boyd said “good morning to you” in a fruity voice and birds were busy in the trees and then lolita yawned frigid gentlewo men of the jury i had thought that months  perhaps years would elapse before i dared to reveal myself to dolores haze but by six she was wide awake and by six fifteen we were technically lovers i am going to tell you something very strange it was she who seduced me upon hearing her first morning yawn i feigned handsome profiled sleep i just did not know what to do would she be shocked at finding me by her side and not in some spare bed would she collect her clothes and lock herself up in the bathroom would she demand to be taken at once to ramsdale—to her mother ’s bedside—back to camp but my lo was a sportive lassie i felt her eyes on me and when she uttered at last that beloved chortlin g note of hers i knew her eyes had been laughing she rolled over to my side and her warm brown hair came against my collarbone i gave a mediocre imitation of waking up we lay quietly  i gently caressed her hair and we gently kissed her kiss to my delirious embarrassment had some rathe r comical refinements of flutter and probe which made me conclude she had been coached at an early age by a little lesbian no charlie boy could have taught her that as if to see whether i had my fill and learned the lesson she drew away and survey ed me her cheekbones were flushed her full underlip glistened my dissolution was near all at once with a burst of rough glee the sign of the nymphet she put her mouth to my ear—but for quite a while my mind could not separate into words the hot thunder of her whisper  and she laughed and brushed the hair off her face and tried again and gradually the odd sense of living in a brand new mad new dream world where everything was permissible came over me as i realized what she was suggesting i answered i did not know what game she and charlie had played “you mean you have never—”— her features twisted into a stare of disgusted incredulity  “you have never —” she started again i took time out by nuzzling her a little “lay off will you” she said with a twangy whine hastily removing her brow n shoulder from my lips it was very curio us the way she considered—and kept doing so for a long time—all caresses except kisses on the mouth or the stark act of love either “romantic slosh” or “abnormal” “you mean” she persisted now kneeling above me “you never did it when you were a kid” “never ” i answered quite truthfully “okay ” said lolita “here is where we start” however  i shall not bore my learned readers with a detailed account of lolita’ s presumption suffice it to say that not a trace of modesty did i perceive in this beautiful hardly formed young girl whom modern co education juven ile mores the campfire racket and so forth had utterly and hopelessly depraved she saw the stark act merely as part of a youngster ’s furtive world unknown to adults what adults did for purposes of procreation was no business of hers my life was handled by little lo in an energetic matteroffact manner as if it were an insensate gadget unconnected with me while eager to impress me with the world of tough kids she was not quite prepared for certain discrepancies betw een a kid’s life and mine pride alone prevented her from giving up for in my strange predicament i feigned supreme stupidity and had her have her way—at least while i could still bear it but really these are irrelevant matters i am not concerned with socalled “sex” at all anybody can imagine those elements of animality  a greater endeavor lures me on to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets  i have to tread carefully  i have to speak in a whisper  oh you veteran crime reporter  you grave old usher  you once popular policeman now in solitary confinement after gracing that school crossing for years you wretched emeritus read to by a boy it would never do would it to have you fellows fall madly in love with my lolita had i been a painter  had the management of the enchanted hunters lost its mind one summ er day and commissioned me to redecorate their dining room with murals of my own making this is what i might have thought up let me list some fragments there would have been a lake there would have been an arbor in flame flower  there would have been nature studies—a tiger pursuing a bird of paradise a choking snake sheathing whole the flayed trunk of a shoat there would have been a sultan  his face expressing great agony belied as it were by his molding caress helping a callypygean slave child to climb a column of onyx there would have been those luminous globules of gonadal glow that travel up the opalescent sides of juke boxes there would have been all kinds of camp activities on the part of the intermediate group canoeing coranting combing curls in the lakeside sun there would have been poplars apples a suburban sunday  there would have been a fire opal dissolving withi n a rippleringed pool a last throb a last dab of color  stinging red smarting pink a sigh a wincing child  i am trying to describe these things not to relive them in my present boundless miser y but to sort out the portion of hell and the portion of heaven in that strange awful maddening world—nymphet love the beastly and beautiful merged at one point and it is that borderline i would like to fix and i feel i fail to do so utterly  why the stipulation of the roman law according to which a girl may marry at twelve was adopted by the church and is still preserved rather tacitly  in some of the united states and fifteen is lawful everywhere there is nothing wrong say both hemisp heres when a brute of forty  blessed by the local priest and bloated with drink sheds his sweatdrenched finery and thrusts himself up to the hilt into his youthful bride “in such stimulating temperate climates says an old magazine in this prison library as st louis chicago and cincinnati girls mature about the end of their twelfth year” dolores haze was born less than three hundred miles from stimulating cincinnati i have but followed nature i am nature’ s faithful hound why then this horror that i cannot shake off did i deprive her of her flower sensitive gentlewo men of the jury i was not even her first lover   she told me the way she had been debauched we ate flavorless mealy bananas bruised peaches and very palatable potato chips and die kleine told me everything her voluble but disjointed account was accompanied by many a droll moue  as i think i have already observed i especially remember one wry face on an “ugh ” basis jellymouth distended sideways and eyes rolled up in a routin e blend of comic disgust resignation and tolerance for young frailty  her astounding tale started with an introductory mention of her tentmate of the previous summer  at another camp a “very select” one as she put it that tentmate “quite a derelict character ” “halfcrazy ” but a “swell kid” instructed her in various manipulations at first loyal lo refused to tell me her name “was it grace angel” i asked she shook her head no it wasn’ t it was the daughter of a big shot he— “was it perhaps rose carmine” “no of course not her father—” “was it then agnes sheridan perchance” she swallowed and shook her head—and then did a double take “say  how come you know all those kids” i explained “well” she said “they are pretty bad some of that school bunch but not that bad if you have to know  her name was elizabeth talbot she goes now to a swanky private school her father is an executive” i recalled with a funny pang the frequency with which poor charlotte used to introduc e into party chat such elegant tidbits as “when my daughter was out hiking last year with the t albot girl” i wanted to know if either mother learned of those sapphic diversions “gosh no” exhaled limp lo mimicking dread and relief pressing a falsely fluttering hand to her chest i was more interested however  in heterosexual experience she had entered the sixth grade at eleven soon after moving to ramsdale from themiddle w est what did she mean by “pretty bad” well the miranda twins had shared the same bed for years and donald scott who was the dumbest boy in the school had done it with hazel smith in his uncle’s garage and kenneth knight—who was the brightest—used to exhibit himself wherever and whenever he had a chance and— “let us switch to camp q” i said and presently i got the whole story  barbara burke a sturdy blond two years older than lo and by far the camp’ s best swimmer  had a very special canoe which she shared with lo “because i was the only other girl who could make willow island” some swimming test i imagine through july every morning—mark reader  every blessed morning—barbara and lo would be helped to carry the boat to onyx or eryx two small lakes in the wood by charlie holmes the camp mistress’ son aged thirtee n—and the only human male for a couple of miles around excepting an old meek stonedeaf handyman and a farmer in an old ford who sometimes sold the campers eggs as farmers will every morning oh my reader  the three children would take a short cut through the beautiful innoce nt forest brimming with all the emblems of youth dew birdsongs and at one point among the luxuriant under growth lo would be left as sentinel while barbara and the boy copulated behind a bush at first lo had refused “to try what it was like” but curiosity and camaraderie prevailed and soon she and barbara were doing it by turns with the silent coarse and surly but indefatigable charlie who had as much sex appeal as a raw carrot but sported a fascinating collection of contraceptives which he used to fish out of a third nearby lake a considerably larger and more populous one called lake climax after the booming young factory town of that name although conceding it was “sort of fun” and “fine for the complexion” lolita i am glad to say held charlie’ s mind and manners in the greatest contempt nor had her temperament been roused by that filthy fiend in fact i think he had rather stunned it despite the “fun” by that time it was close to ten with the ebb of lust an ashen sense of awfulness abetted by the realistic drabness of a gray neuralgi c day crept over me and hummed within my temples brown naked frail lo her narrow white buttocks to me her sulky face to a door mirror  stood arms akimbo feet in new slippers with pussyfur tops wide apart and through a forehanging lock tritely mugged at herself in the glass from the corridor came the cooing voices of colored maids at work and presently there was amild attempt to open the door of our room i had lo go to the bathroom and take a muchne eded soap shower  the bed was a frightful mess with overtones of potato chips she tried on a twopiece navy wool then a sleeveless blouse with a swirly clathrate skirt but the first was too tight and the second too ample and when i begged her to hurry up the situation was beginning to frighten me lo viciously sent those nice prese nts of mine hurtling into a corner  and put on yesterday’ s dress when she was ready at last i gave her a lovely new purse of simulated calf in which i had slipped quite a few penn ies and two mintbright dimes and told her to buy herself a magazine in the lobby  “i’ll be down in a minute” i said “and if i were you my dear i would not talk to strangers” except for my poor little gifts there was not much to pack but i was forced to devot e a dangerous amount of time was she up to something downstairs to arranging the bed in such a way as to suggest the abandoned nest of a restless father and his tomboy daughter  instead of an exconvict’ s saturnalia with a couple of fat old whores then i finished dressing and had the hoary bellboy come up for the bags everything was fine there in the lobby  she sat deep in an overstuf fed bloodred armchair  deep in a lurid movie magazine a fellow of my age in tweeds the genre of the place had changed overnight to a spurious country squire atmosphere was staring at my lolita over his dead cigar and stale newspaper  she wore her profes sional white socks and saddle oxfords and that bright print frock with the square throat a splash of jaded lamplight brought out the golden down on her warm brown limbs there she sat her legs carelessly highcrossed and her pale eyes skimming along the lines with every now and then a blink bill’s wife had worshiped him from afar long before they ever met in fact she used to secretly admire the famous young actor as he ate sundaes in schwab’ s drugstore nothing could have been more childish than her snubbed nose freckled face or the purplish spot on her naked neck where a fairytale vampire had feasted or the unconscious movement of her tongue exploring a touch of rosy rash around her swollen lips nothing could be more harmless than to read about jill an energetic starlet who made her own clothes and was a student of serious literature nothing could be more innocent than the part in that glossy brown hair with that silky sheen on the temple nothing could be more naïve—but what sickening envy the lecherous fellow whoever he was—come to thinkof it he resembled a little my swiss uncle gustave also a great admirer of le découvert —would have experienced had he known that every nerve in me was still anointed and ringed with the feel of her body— the body of some immortal daemon disguised as a female child was pink pig mr  swoon absolutely sure my wife had not telephoned he was if she did would he tell her we had gone on to aunt clare’s place he would indeedie  i settled the bill and roused lo from her chair  she read to the car still reading she was driven to a socalled coffee shop a few blocks south oh she ate all right she even laid aside her magazine to eat but a queer dullness had replaced her usual cheerfulness i knew little lo could be very nasty  so i braced mysel f and grinned and waited for a squall i was unbathed unshaven and had had no bowel movement my nerves were a jangle i did not like the way my little mistress shrugged her shoulders and distended her nostrils when i attempted casual small talk had phyllis been in the know before she joined her parents in maine i asked with a smile “look” said lo making a weep ing grimace “let us get off the subject” i then tried—also unsuccessfully  no matter how i smacked my lips—to interest her in the road map our destination was let me remind my patient reader whose meek temper lo ought to have copied the gay town of lepingville somewhere near a hypothetical hospital that destination was in itself a perfec tly arbitrary one as alas so many were to be and i shook in my shoes as i wondered how to keep the whole arrangement plausible and what other plausible objectives to invent after we had taken in all the movies in lepingville more and more uncomfortable did humbert feel it was something quite special that feeling an oppressive hideous constraint as if i were sitting with the small ghost of somebody i had just killed as she was in the act of getting back into the car an expression of pain flitted across lo’s face it flitte d again more meaningfully  as she settled down beside me no doubt she reproduced it that second time for my benefit foolishl y i asked her what was the matter  “nothing you brute” she replied “you what” i asked she was silent leaving briceland loquacious lo was silent cold spiders of panic crawled down my back this was an orphan this was a lone child an absolute waif with whom a heavylimbed foulsmelling adult had had strenuous intercourse three times that very mornin g whether or not the realization of a lifelong dream had surpassed all expectation it had in a sense overshot its mark—and plunged into a nightmare i had been careless stupid and ignoble and let me bequite frank somewhere at the bottom of that dark turmoil i felt the writhing of desire again so monstrous was my appetite for that miserable nymphet mingled with the pangs of guilt was the agonizing thought that her mood might prevent me from making love to her again as soon as i found a nice country road where to park in peace in other words poor humbert humbert was dreadfully unhappy  and while steadily and inanely driving toward lepingv ille he kept racking his brains for some quip under the bright wing of which he might dare turn to his seatmate it was she however  who broke the silence “oh a squashed squirrel” she said “what a shame” “yes isn’ t it” eager  hopeful hum “let us stop at the next gas station” lo continued “i want to go to the washroom” “we shall stop wherever you want” i said and then as a lovely  lonely  supercilious grove oaks i thought american trees at that stage were beyond me started to echo greenly the rush of our car a red and ferny road on our right turned its head before slanting into the woodland and i suggested we might perhaps— “drive on” my lo cried shrilly  “righto t ake it easy ” down poor beast down i glanced at her  thank god the child was smiling “you chump” she said sweetly smiling at me “you revolting creature i was a daisyfres h girl and look what you’ve done to me i ough t to call the police and tell them you raped me oh you dirty  dirty old man” was she just joking an ominous hysterical note rang through her silly words presentl y making a sizzling sound with her lips she started complaining of pains said she could not sit said i had torn something inside her the sweat rolled down my neck and we almost ran over some little animal or other that was crossing the road with tail erect and again my viletempered companion called me an ugly name when we stopped at the filling station she scrambled out without a word and was a long time away  slowly  lovingly  an elderly frien d with a broken nose wiped my windshield —they do it differently at every place from chamois cloth to soapy brush this fellow used a pink sponge she appeared at last “look” she said in that neutral voice that hurt me so “give me some dimes and nickels i want to call mother in that hospital what’ s the number”“get in” i said “y ou can’ t call that number ” “why” “get in and slam the door ” she got in and slammed the door the old garage man beamed at her i swung onto the highway  “why can’ t i call my mother if i want to” “because” i answered “your mother is dead”  in the gay town of lepingville i bought her four books of comi cs a box of candy  a box of sanitary pads two cokes a manicure set a travel clock with a luminous dial a ring with a real topaz a tennis racket roller skates with white high shoes field glasse s a portable radio set chewing gum a transparent raincoat sunglasses some more garments— swooners shorts all kinds of summer frocks at the hotel we had separate rooms but in the middle of the night she came sobbing into mine and we made it up very gently  you see she had absolutely nowhere else to gopart two  it was then that began our extensive travels all over the states to any other type of tourist accommodation i soon grew to prefer the functional motel— clean neat safe nooks ideal places for sleep argument reconciliation insatiable illicit love at first in my dread of arousing suspicion i would eagerly pay for both sections of one double unit each containing a double bed i wondered what type of foursome this arrangement was ever intended for since only a pharisaic parody of privacy could be attained by means of the incomplete partition dividing the cabin or room into two communicating love nests by and by the very possibilities that such honest promiscuity suggested two young couples merrily swapping mates or a child shamming sleep to earwitness prim al sonorities made me bolder  and every now and then i would take a bedandcot or twinbed cabin a prison cell of paradise with yellow window shades pulled down to create a morning illusion of venice and sunshine when actually it was pennsylvania and rain we came to know—nous connûmes  to use a flaube rtian intonation —the stone cottages under enormous chateaubriandesque trees the brick unit the adobe unit the stucco court on what the tour book of the automobile association describes as “shaded” or “spacious” or “landscaped” grounds the log kind finished in knotty pine reminded lo by its goldenbrown glaze of friedchicken bones we held in contempt the plain whitewashed clapboard kabin s with their faint sewerish smell or some other gloomy selfconscious stench and nothing to boast of except “good beds” and an unsmiling landlady always prepared to have her gift “… well i could give you …” turned down nous connûmes this is royal fun the wouldbe enticements of their repetitious names—all those sunset motels ubeam cottage s hillcrest courts pine view courts mountain view courts skyline courts park plaza courts green acres mac’ s courts there was sometimes a special line in the writeup such as “children welcome pets allowed” you are welcome you are allowed the baths were mostly tiled showers with an endless variety of spouting mechanisms but with one definitely nonlaodicean characteristic in common a propensity  while in use to turn instantly beastly hot or blindingly cold upon you depending on whether your neighbor turned on his cold or his hot to deprive you of a necessary complement in the shower you had so carefully blended some motels had instructions pasted above the toilet on whose tank the towels were unhygienically heaped asking guests not to throw into its bowl garbage beer cans cartons stillborn babies others had special notices under glass such as things to do riding you will often see riders coming down main street on their way back from a romantic moonlight ride “often at  am” sneered unromantic lo nous connûmes the various types of motor court operators the reformed criminal the retired teacher and the business flop among the males and the motherly  pseud oladylike and madamic variants among the females and sometimes trains would cry in the monstrously hot and humid night with heartrending and ominous plang ency mingling power and hysteria in one desperate scream we avoided tourist homes country cousins of funeral ones old fashioned genteel and showerless with elaborate dressing tables in depressingly whiteandpink little bedrooms and photographs of the landlady’ s childr en in all their instars but i did surrender  now and then to lo’s predilection for “real” hotels she would pick out in the book while i petted her in the parked car in the silence of a duskmellowed mysterious sideroad some highly recommended lake lodge which offered all sorts of things magnified by the flashlight she moved over them such as congenial company  betweenmeals snacks outdoor barbecues—but which in my mind conjured up odious visions of stinking high school boys in sweatshirts and an ember red cheek pressing against hers while poor dr humbert embracing nothing but two masculine knees would coldhumor his piles on the damp turf most tempting to her too were those “colonial” inns which apart from “gracious atmosphere” and picture windows promised “unlimited quantities of mmm food” treasured recollections of my father ’s palatial hotel sometime s led me to seek for its like in the strange country we traveled through i was soon discouraged but lo kept following the scent of rich food ads while i derived a not exclusively economic kick from such roadside signs as timber hotel  childr en under  free on the other hand i shudder when recalling that soidisant “highclass” resort in a midwestern state which advertised “raidtheicebox” midnight snacks andintrigued by my accent wanted to know my dead wife’ s and dead mother ’s maiden names a twodays’ stay there cost me a hundred and twentyfour dollars and do you rememb er miranda that other “ultrasmart” robbers’ den with complimentary mornin g coffee and circulating ice water  and no children under sixteen no lolitas of course immediately upon arrival at one of the plainer motor courts which became our habitual haunts she would set the electric fan awhirr  or induce me to drop a quarter into the radio or she would read all the signs and inquire with a whine why she could not go riding up some advertised trail or swim ming in that local pool of warm mineral water  most often in the slouching bored way she cultivated lo would fall prostrate and abominably desirable into a red springchair or a green chaise longue or a steamer chair of striped canvas with footrest and canopy  or a sling chair  or any other lawn chair under a garden umbrella on the patio and it would take hours of blandishments threats and promises to make her lend me for a few seconds her brown limbs in the seclusion of the fivedollar room before undertaking anything she might prefer to my poor joy  a combination of naïveté and deception of charm and vulgarity  of blue sulks and rosy mirth lolita when she chose could be a most exasperating brat i was not really quite prepared for her fits of disor ganize d boredom intense and vehement griping her sprawling droopy  dopeyeyed style and what is called goofing off—a kind of diffused clowning which she thought was tough in a boyish hoodlum way mentally  i found her to be a disgustingly conventional little girl sweet hot jazz square dancing gooey fudge sundaes musicals movie magazines and so forth—these were the obvious items in her list of beloved things the lord knows how many nickels i fed to the gorgeous music boxes that came with every meal we had i still hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her people with names like sammy and jo and eddy and tony and peggy and guy and patti and rex and sentimental song hits all of them as similar to my ear as her vario us cand ies were to my palate she believed with a kind of celestial trust any advertisement or advice that appeared in movie love or screen land —starasil starves pimples or “you better watch out if you’re wearing your shirttails outside your jeans gals because jill says you shouldn’ t” if a roadside sign said visit our gift shop—we had to visit it had to buy its indian curios dolls copper jewelry  cactus candy  the words “novelties and souvenirs” simp ly entranced her by their trochaic lilt if some café signproclaimed icecold drinks she was automatically stirred although all drinks everywhere were icecol d she it was to whom ads were dedicated the ideal consumer  the subject and object of every foul poster  and she attempted—unsuccessfully—to patronize only those restaurants where the holy spirit of huncan dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottagecheesecrested salads in those days neither she nor i had thought up yet the system of monetary bribes which was to work such havoc with my nerves and her morals somewh at later i relied on three other methods to keep my pubescent concubine in submission and passable temper  a few years before she had spent a rainy summer under miss phalen’ s bleary eye in a dilapidated appalachian farmhouse that had belonged to some gnarled haze or other in the dead past it still stood among its rank acres of golden rod on the edge of a flowerless forest at the end of a permanently muddy road twenty miles from the nearest hamlet lo recalled that scarecrow of a house the solitude the soggy old pastures the wind the bloated wilderness with an energy of disgust that distorted her mouth and fattened her halfrevealed tongue and it was there that i warned her she would dwell with me in exile for months and years if need be studyin g under me french and latin unless her “present attitude” changed charlotte i began to understand you a simple child lo would scream no and frantically clutch at my driving hand whenever i put a stop to her tornadoes of temper by turning in the middle of a highway with the implication that i was about to take her straight to that dark and dismal abode the farther  however  we traveled away from it west the less tangible that menace became and i had to adopt other methods of persuasion among these the reformatory threat is the one i recall with the deepest moan of shame from the very beginning of our concourse i was clever enough to realize that i must secure her complete cooperation in keeping our relations secret that it should become a second nature with her no matter what grudge she might bear me no matter what other pleasures she might seek “come and kiss your old man” i would say “and drop that moody nonsense in former times when i was still your dream male the reader will notice what pains i took to speak lo’s

elusive male ‘elusive’ is good by polonius the wise mother and your poor mother would have been wise had she lived will encourage a companionship between father and daughter  realizing—excuse the corny style—that the girl forms her ideals of romance and of men from her association with her father  now  what association does this cheery book mean—and recommend i quote again among sicilians sexual relations between a father and his daughter are accepted as a matter of course and the girl who participates in such relationship is not looked upon with disapp roval by the society of which she is part i’m a great admirer of sicilians fine athletes fine musicians fine upright people lo and great lovers but let’s not digress only the other day we read in the newspapers some bunkum about a middle aged morals offender who pleaded guilty to the violation of the mann act and to transporting a nineyear old girl across state lines for immoral purpos es whatever these are dolores darling you

flower with thirtynine other dopes in a dirty dormitory no allow me please under the supervision of hideous matrons this is the situation this is the choice don’ t you think that under the circumstances dolores haze had better stick to her old man” by rubbing all this in i succeeded in terrorizing lo who despite a certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a child as her iq might suggest but if i managed to establish that background of shared secrecy and shared guilt i was much less successful in keeping her in good humor  every morning during our yearlong travels i had to devise some expectation some special point in space and time for her to look forward to for her to survive till bedtime otherwise deprived of a shaping and sustaining purpose the skeleton of her day sagged and collapsed the object in view might be anythin g—a lighthouse in virginia a natural cave in arkansas converted to a café a collection of guns and violins somewhere in okla homa a replica of the grotto of lourdes in louisiana shabby photographs of the bonanza mining period in the local museum of a rocky mountains resort anything whatsoever—but it had to be there in front ofus like a fixed star although as likely as not lo would feign gagging as soon as we got to it by putting the geography of the united states into motion i did my best for hours on end to give her the impression of “going places” of rolling on to some definite destination to some unusual delight i have never seen such smooth amiable roads as those that now radiated before us across the crazy quilt of fortyeight states voraciously we consumed those long highways in rapt silence we glided over their glossy black dance floors not only had lo no eye for scenery but she furiously resented my calling her atten tion to this or that ench anting detail of landscape which i myself learned to discern only after being exposed for quite a time to the delicate beauty ever present in the margin of our undeserving journey  by a paradox of pictorial thought the average lowland northamerican countryside had at first seemed to me something i accepted with a shock of amused recognition because of those painted oilcloths which were imported from america in the old days to be hung above washstands in centr aleuropean nurseries and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic green views they depicted—opa que curly trees a barn cattle a brook the dull white of vague orchards in bloom and perhaps a stone fence or hills of greenish gouache but gradually the models of those elementary rusticities became stranger and stranger to the eye the nearer i came to know them beyond the tilled plain beyon d the toy roofs there would be a slow suffusion of inutile loveliness a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm peeledpeach tinge pervading the upper edge of a twodimensional dove gray cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist there might be a line of spaced trees silhouetted agains t the horizon and hot still noons above a wilderness of clover  and claude lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background or again it might be a stern el greco horizon pregnant with inky rain and a passing glimpse of some mummynecked farmer  and all around alternating strips of quicksilverish water and harsh green corn the whole arrangement opening like a fan somewhere in kansas now and then in the vastness of those plains huge trees would advance toward us to cluster selfconsci ously by the roadside and provide a bit of humanitarian shade above a picnic table with sun flecks flattened paper cups samaras and discarded icecream sticks littering the brown ground agreat user of roadside facilities my unfastidious lo would be charmed by toilet signs—gu ysgals johnj ane jackjill and even buck’ sdoe’ s while lost in an artist’ s dream i would stare at the honest brightness of the gasoline paraphernalia against the splendid green of oaks or at a distant hill scrambling out—scarred but still untamed—from the wilderness of agriculture that was trying to swallow it at night tall trucks studded with colored lights like dreadful giant christmas trees loomed in the darkness and thundered by the belated little sedan and again next day a thinly populated sky losing its blue to the heat would melt overhead and lo would clamor for a drink and her cheeks would hollow vigorously over the straw  and the car inside would be a furnace when we got in again and the road shimmered ahead with a remote car changing its shape miragelike in the surface glare and seeming to hang for a moment oldfashionedly square and high in the hot haze and as we pushed westwar d patches of what the garageman called “sage brush” appeared and then the mysterio us outlines of tablelike hills and then red bluffs inkblotted with junipers  and then a mountain range dun grading into blue and blue into dream and the desert would meet us with a steady gale dust gray thorn bushes and hideous bits of tissue paper mimicking pale flowers among the prickles of windtortured withered stalks all along the highway in the middle of which there sometimes stood simple cows immobilized in a position tail left white eyelashes right cuttin g across all human rules of traf fic my lawy er has suggested i give a clear  frank account of the itinerary we followed and i suppose i have reached here a point where i cannot avoid that chore roughly  during that mad year august  to august  our route began with a series of wiggles and whorls in new england then meandered south up and down east and west dipped deep into ce qu’on appelle dixieland avoided florida because the farlows were there veered west zigzagged through corn belts and cotton belts this is not too clear i am afraid clare nce but i did not keep any notes and have at my disposal only an atrociously crippled tour book in three volumes almost a symbol of my torn and tattered past in which to check these recollectio ns crossed and recrossed the rockies straggled through southern desert s where we wintered reached the pacific turned north through the pale lilac fluff of flowering shrubs along forest roads almost reached the canadian border and proceeded east across good lands and bad lands back to agriculture ona grand scale avoiding despite little lo’s strident remonstration s little lo’s birthplace in a corn coal and hog producing area and finally returned to the fold of the east petering out in the college town of beardsley  now  in perusin g what follows the reader should bear in mind not only the general circuit as adumbrated above with its many sidetrips and tourist traps secondary circles and skittish deviations but also the fact that far from being an indolent partie de plaisir  our tour was a hard twisted teleological growth whose sole raison d’ětr e these french clichés are symptomatic was to keep my companion in passable humor from kiss to kiss thumbing through that battered tour book i dimly evoke that magnolia garden in a southern state which cost me four bucks and which  according to the ad in the book you must visit for three reasons because john galsworthy a stonedead writer of sorts acclaimed it as the world’s fairest garden because in  baede ker’s guide had marked it with a star and finally  because … o reader  my reader  guess … because children and by jingo was not my lolita a child will “walk starryeyed and reverently through this foretaste of heave n drinking in beauty that can influence a life” “not mine” said grim lo and settled down on a bench with the fillings of two sunday papers in her lovely lap we passed and repassed through the whole gamut of american roadside restaurants from the lowly eat with its deer head dark trace of long tear at inner canthus “humorous” picture post cards of the posterior “kurort” type impaled guest checks

of hers and i woul d often catch her coulant un r egard in the direction of some amiable male some grease monkey with a sinewy goldenbrown forearm and watc hbraceleted wrist and hardly had i turned my back to go and buy this very lo a lollipop than i would hear her and the fair mechanic burst into a perfect love song of wisecracks when during our longer stops i would relax after a particularly violent morning in bed and out of the goodness of my lulled heart allow her— indulgent hum—to visit the rose garden or children’ s library across the street with a motor court neighbor ’s plain little mary and mary’ s eightyear  old brother  lo would come back an hour late with barefoot mary trailing far behind and the little boy metamorphosed into two gangli ng golden haired high school uglies all muscles and gonorrhea the reader may well imagine what i answered my pet when—rather uncertainly  i admit—shewould ask me if she could go with carl and al here to the roller skating rink i remem ber the first time a dusty windy afternoon i did let her go to one such rink cruel ly she said it would be no fun if i accompanied her since that time of day was reserv ed for teenagers we wrangled out a compromise i remained in the car among other empty cars with their noses to the canvastopped openair rink where some fifty young people many in pairs were endlessly rolling round and round to mechanical music and the wind silvered the trees dolly wore blue jeans and white high shoes as most of the other girls did i kept counting the revolutions of the rolling crowd—and suddenly she was missing when she rolled past again she was together with three hoodlums whom i had heard analyze a moment before the girl skaters from the outside—and jeer at a lovely leggy young thing who had arrived clad in red shorts instead of those jeans or slacks at inspe ction stations on highways entering arizona or california a policeman’ s cousin would peer with such intensity at us that my poor heart wobbled “any honey” he would inquire and every time my sweet fool giggled i still have vibrating all along my optic nerve visions of lo on horseback a link in the chain of a guided trip along a bridle trail lo bobbing at a walking pace with an old woman rider in front and a lecherous rednecked duderancher behind and i behind him hating his fat flowery shirted back even more fervently than a motorist does a slow truck on a mountain road or else at a ski lodge i would see her floating away from me celestial and solitary  in an ethereal chairlift up and up to a glittering summit where laughing athletes stripped to the waist were waiting for her for her  in whatever town we stopped i would inquire in my polite european way anent the whereabouts of natatoriums museums local schools the number of children in the nearest school and so forth and at school bus time smiling and twitching a little i discovered this tic nerveux because cruel lo was the first to mimic it i would park at a strategic point with my vagrant schoolgirl beside me in the car to watch the children leave school —always a pretty sight this sort of thing soon began to bore my so easily bored lolita and having a childish lack of sympathy for other people’ s whims she would insult me and my desire to have her caress me while blueeyed little brunettes in blue shorts copperheads in green boleros and blurred boyish blondes in faded slacks passed by in the sunas a sort of compromise i freely advocated whenever and wherever possible the use of swimming pools with other girlchildren she adored brilliant water and was a rema rkably smart diver  comfortab ly robed i would settle down in the rich postmeridian shade after my own demure dip and there i would sit with a dummy book or a bag of bonbons or both or nothing but my tingling glands and watch her gambol rubbercapped bepearled smoothly tanned as glad as an ad in her trimfitted satin pants and shirred bra pubescent sweetheart how smugly would i marvel that she was mine mine mine and revise the recent matitudinal swoon to the moan of the mourning doves and devise the late afternoon one and slitting my sunspeared eyes compare lolita to whatever other nymphets parsimonious chance collected around her for my anthological delectation and judgment and today putting my hand on my ailing heart i really do not think that any of them ever surpassed her in desirability  or if they did it was so two or three times at the most in a certain light with certain perfumes blended in the air—once in the hopeless case of a pale spanish child the daughter of a heavyjawed nobleman and another time— mats je divague  naturally  i had to be always wary  fully realizing in my lucid jealousy  the danger of those dazzling romps i had only to turn away for a moment— to walk say a few steps in order to see if our cabin was at last ready after the morning change of linen—and lo and behold upon returning i would find the former  les yeux perdus dipping and kicking her longtoed feet in the water on the stone edge of which she lolled while on either side of her there crouched a brun adolescent whom her russet beauty and the quicksilver in the baby folds of her stomach were sure to cause to se tordre —oh baudelaire—in recurrent dreams for months to come i tried to teach her to play tenni s so we might have more amusements in common but although i had been a good player in my prime i proved to be hopeless as a teacher and so in california i got her to take a number of very expensive lessons with a famou s coach  a husky  wrink led oldtimer  with a harem of ball boys he looked an awful wreck off the court but now and then when in the course of a lesson to keep up the exchange he would put out as it were an exquisite spring blossom of a strok e and twang the ball back to his pupil that divine delicacy of absolute power made me recall that thirty years before i had seen him in cannes demo lish the great gobbert until she began takin g those lessons i thought she would never learn the game on this or that hotel court i would drill lo and try to relivethe days when in a hot gale a daze of dust and queer lassitude i fed ball after ball to gay innocent elegant annabel gleam of bracelet pleated white skirt black velvet hair band with every word of persistent advice i would only augment lo’s sulle n fury to our games oddly enough she preferred—at least before we reached california—formles s pat ball approximations—more ball hunting than actual play—with a wispy  weak wonderfully pretty in an ange gauche way coeval a helpful spectator  i would go up to that other child  and inhale her faint musky fragrance as i touched her forearm and held her knobby wrist and push this way or that her cool thigh to show her the backhand stance in the meantime lo bending forward would let her sunnybrown curls hang forward as she stuck her racket like a cripple’ s stick into the ground and emitted a tremendous ugh of disgust at my intrusion i would leave them to their game and look on comparing their bodies in motion a silk scarf round my throat this was in south arizona i think—and the days had a lazy lining of warmth and awkward lo would slash at the ball and miss it and curse and send a simulacrum of a serve into the net and show the wet glistening young down of her armpit as she brandished her racket in despair  and her even more insipid partner would dutifully rush out after every ball and retrieve none but both were enjoying themselves beautifully  and in clear ringing tones kept the exact score of their ineptitudes all the time one day i remember  i offered to bring them cold drinks from the hotel and went up the gravel path and came back with two tall glasses of pineapple juice soda and ice and then a sudden void within my chest made me stop as i saw that the tennis court was deserted i stooped to set down the glasses on a bench and for some reason with a kind of icy vividness saw charlotte’ s face in death and i glanced around and noticed lo in white shorts receding through the speckled shadow of a garden path in the company of a tall man who carried two tennis rackets i sprang after them but as i was crashing through the shrubbery  i saw in an alternate vision as if life’s course constantly branc hed lo in slacks and her companion in shorts trudging up and down a small weedy area and beating bushes with their rackets in listless search for their last lost ball i itemize these sunny nothings mainly to prove to my judges that i did everything in my power to give my lolita a really good time how charming it was to see her a child herself showing another child some of her few accomplishments such as for example a special way of jumpingrope with her right hand holding her left arm behind her untanned back the lesser nymphet a diaphanous darling would be all eyes as the pavonine sun was all eyes on the gravel under the flowering trees while in the midst of that oculate paradise my freckled and raffish lass skipped repeating the movements of so many others i had gloated over on the sunshot watered dampsmelling sidewalks and ramparts of ancient europe presently  she would hand the rope back to her little spanish friend and watch in her turn the repeated lesson and brush away the hair from her brow  and fold her arms and step on one toe with the other  or drop her hands loosely upon her still unflared hips and i would satisfy myself that the damned staff had at last finished cleaning up our cottage whereupon flashing a smile to the shy darkhaired page girl of my princess and thrusting my fatherly fingers deep into lo’s hair from behind and then gently but firmly clasping them around the nape of her neck i would lead my reluctant pet to our small home for a quick connection before dinner  “whose cat has scratched poor you” a fullblown fleshy handsome woman of the repulsive type to which i was particularly attractive might ask me at the “lodge” during a table d’hôte dinner followed by dancing promised to lo this was one of the reasons why i tried to keep as far away from people as possible while lo on the other hand would do her utmost to draw as many potential witnesses into her orbit as she could she would be figuratively speaking wagging her tiny tail her whole behind in fact as little bitches do—while some grinning stranger accosted us and began a bright conversation with a comparative study of license plates “long way from home” inquisitive parents in order to pump lo about me would suggest her going to a movie with their children we had some close shaves the waterfall nuisan ce pursued me of course in all our caravansaries but i never realized how wafery their wall substance was until one evening after i had loved too loudly  a neighbor ’s masculine cough filled the pause as clearly as mine would have done and next morning as i was having breakfast at the milk bar lo was a late sleeper  and i liked to bring her a pot of hot coffee in bed my neighbor of the eve an elderly fool wearing plain glasses on his long virtuous nose and a convention badg e on his lapel somehow managed to rig up a conversation with me in the course of which he inquired if my missus was like his missus a rather reluctant getup per when not on the farm and had not the hideous danger i was skirting almost suffocated me i might have enjoyedthe odd look of surprise on his thinlipped weather beaten face when i drily answered as i slithered of f my stool that i was thank god a widower  how sweet it was to bring that coffee to her and then deny it until she had done her morning duty and i was such a thoughtful friend such a passionate fathe r such a good pediatrician attending to all the wants of my little auburn brunette’ s body my only grudge against nature was that i could not turn my lolita inside out and apply voracious lips to her young matrix her unknown heart her nacreous liver the seagrapes of her lungs her comely twin kidneys on especially tropical afternoons in the sticky closeness of the siesta i liked the cool feel of armchair leather against my massive nakedness as i held her in my lap there she would be a typical kid picking her nose while engrossed in the lighter sections of a newspaper  as indif ferent to my ecstasy as if it were something she had sat upon a shoe a doll the handle of a tennis racket and was too indolent to remove her eyes would follow the adventure s of her favorite strip characters there was one welldrawn sloppy bobbysoxer  with high cheekbones and angular gestures that i was not above enjoying myself she studied the photographic results of headon collisions she never doubted the reality of place time and circumstance alleged to match the publicity pictures of nakedthighed beauties and she was curiously fascinated by the photographs of local brides some in full wedding apparel holding bouquets and wearing glasses a fly would settle and walk in the vicinity of her navel or explore her tender pale areolas she tried to catch it in her fist charlotte’ s method and then would turn to the column let’ s explore y our mind “let’ s explore your mind would sex crimes be reduced if children obeyed a few don’ts don’ t play around public toilets don’ t take candy or rides from strangers if picked up mark down the license of the car ” “… and the brand of the candy ” i volunteered she went on her cheek  recedent agains t mine pursuant and this was a good day  mark o reader “if you don’ t have a pencil but are old enough to read—” “we” i quipquoted “medieval mariners have placed in this bottle—” “if” she repeated “you don’t have a pencil but are old enough to read and write—this is what the guy means isn’t it you dope—scratch the number somehow on the roadside” “with your little claws lolita’ ” she had entered my world umber and black humberland  with rash curiosity she surveyed it with a shrug of amused distaste and it seemed to me now that she was ready to turn away from it with someth ing akin to plain repulsion never did she vibrate under my touch and a strident “what d’you think you are doing” was all i got for my pains to the wonderland i had to offer my fool preferred the corniest movies the most cloying fudge to think that between a ham burger and a humbur ger she would— invariably  with icy precision—p lump for the former  there is nothing more atrociously cruel than an adored child did i mention the name of that milk bar i visited a moment ago it was of all things the frigid queen smiling a little sadly  i dubbed her my frigid princess she did not see the wistful joke oh do not scow l at me reader  i do not intend to convey the impression that i did not manage to be happy  reader must understand that in the possession and thralldom of a nymphet the enchanted traveler stands as it were beyond happiness  for there is no other bliss on earth comparable to that of fondling a nymphet it is hors concours  that bliss it belongs to another class another plane of sensitivity  despite our tiffs despite her nastiness despit e all the fuss and faces she made and the vulgarity  and the danger  and the horrible hopelessness of it all i still dwelled deep in my elected paradise —a paradise whose skies were the color of hellflames— but still a paradise the able psychiatrist who studies my case—and whom by now dr humbert has plunged i trust into a state of leporine fascination—is no doubt anxious to have me take my lolita to the seaside and have me find there at last the “gratification” of a lifetim e urge and release from the “subconscious” obsession of an incomplete childhood romance with the initial little miss lee well comrade let me tell you that i did look for a beach though i also have to confess that by the time we reached its mirage of gray water  so many delights had already been granted me by my traveling companion thatthe search for a kingdom by the sea a sublimated riviera or whatnot far from being the impulse of the subconscious had become the rational pursuit of a purely theoretical thrill the angels knew it and arranged things accordingly  a visit to a plausible cove on the atlantic side was completely messed up by foul weather  a thick damp sky muddy waves  a sense of boundless but somehow matteroffact mist—what could be further removed from the crisp charm the sapphire occasion and rosy contingency of my riviera romance a couple of semitropical beaches on the gulf though bright enough were starred and spattered by venomous beasties and swept by hurricane winds finally on a californian beach facing the phantom of the pacific i hit upon some rather perverse privacy in a kind of cave whence you could hear the shrieks of a lot of girl scouts taking their first surf bath on a separate part of the beach behind rotting trees but the fog was like a wet blanket and the sand was gritty and clammy  and lo was all gooseflesh and grit and for the first time in my life i had as little desire for her as for a manatee perhap s my learned readers may perk up if i tell them that even had we discovered a piece of sympathetic seaside somewhere it would have come too late since my real liberation had occurred much earlier at the moment in point of fact when annabel haze alias dolores lee alias loleeta had appeared to me golden and brown kneeling looking up on that shoddy veranda in a kind of fictitious dishonest but eminently satisfactory seaside arrangement although there was nothing but a secondrate lake in the neighborhood so much for those special sensations influenced if not actually brought about by the tenets of modern psychiatry  consequently  i turned away—i headed my lolita away—from beaches which were either too bleak when lone or too populous when ablaze however  in recollection i suppose of my hopeless hauntings of public parks in europe i was still keenly interested in outdoor activities and desirous of finding suitable playgrounds in the open where i had suffered such shameful privations here too i was to be thwarted the disappointm ent i must now register as i gently grade my story into an expression of the continuous risk and dread that ran through my bliss should in no wise reflect on the lyrical epic tragic but never arcadian amer ican wilds they are beautiful heartrendi ngly beautiful those wilds with a quality of wideeyed unsung innocent surrender that my lacquered toybright swiss villages and exhaustively lauded alps no longer possess innumerable lovers have clipped and kissedon the trim turf of oldworld mountainsides on the innerspring moss by a handy  hygienic rill on rustic benches under the initialed oaks and in so many cabanes in so many beech forests but in the wilds of america the openair lover will not find it easy to indulge in the most ancient of all crimes and pastimes poisonous plants burn his sweetheart’ s buttocks nameless insects sting his sharp items of the forest floor prick his knees insects hers and all around there abides a sustained rustle of potential snakes— que disje  of semiextinct dragons—wh ile the crablike seeds of ferocious flowers cling in a hideous green crust to gartered black sock and sloppy white sock alike i am exaggerat ing a little one summer noon just below timberline where heavenlyhued blossoms that i would fain call larkspur crowded all along a purly mountain brook  we did find lolita and i a secluded romantic spot a hundred feet or so above the pass where we had left our car the slope seemed untrodde n a last panting pine was taking a well earned breather on the rock it had reached a marmot whistled at us and withdrew  beneath the laprobe i had spread for lo dry flowers crepitated softly  venus came and went the jagged cliff crowning the upper talus and a tangle of shrub s growing below us seemed to offer us protection from sun and man alike alas i had not reckoned with a faint side trail that curled up in cagey fashion among the shrubs and rocks a few feet from us it was then that we came close r to detection than ever before and no wonder the experience curbed forever my yearning for rural amours i remember the operation was over all over and she was weeping in my arms—a salutor y storm of sobs after one of the fits of moodiness that had become so frequent with her in the course of that otherwise admirable year i had just retracted some silly promise she had forced me to make in a moment of blind impatient passion and there she was sprawling and sobbing and pinching my cares sing hand and i was laughing happily  and the atroc ious unbelievable unbearable and i suspect eternal horror that i know now was still but a dot of blackness in the blue of my bliss and so we lay when with one of those jolts that have ended by knockin g my poor heart out of its groove i met the unblinking dark eyes of two strange and beautiful children faunlet and nymphet whom their identical flat dark hair and bloodless cheeks proclai med siblings if not twins they stood crouching and gaping at us both in blue playsuits blendin g with the mountain blosso ms i plucked at the laprobe for desperate concealment—and within the same instant something that looked like a polkadotted pushball among the under growth a few paces away  went into a turning motion which was transformed into the gradually rising figure of a stout lady with a ravenblack bob who automatically added a wild lily to her bouquet while staring over her shoulder at us from behind her lovejy carved bluestone children now that i have an altogether different mess on my conscience i know that i am a courageous man but in those days i was not aware of it and i remember being surprised by my own coolness with the quiet murmured order one gives a sweatstained distracted cringing trained animal even in the worst of plights what mad hope or hate makes the young beast’ s flanks pulsate what black stars pierce the heart of the tamer i made lo get up and we decorously walked and then indecorously scuttled down to the car behind it a nifty station wagon was parked and a handsome assyrian with a little blueblack beard un mons ieur très bien in silk shirt and magenta slacks presumably the corpulent botanist’ s husband  was gravely taking the picture of a signboard giving the altitude of the pass it was well over  feet and i was quite out of breath and with a scrunch and a skid we drove off lo still struggling with her clothes and swearin g at me in language that i never dreamed little girls could know  let alone use there were other unpleasant incidents there was the movie theatre once for example lo at the time still had for the cinema a veritable passion it was to decline into tepid condescension during her second high school year we took in voluptuously and indiscriminately  oh i don’t know  one hundred and fifty or two hundred programs during that one year and during some of the denser periods of moviegoing we saw many of the newsreels up to halfadozen times since the same weekly one went with different main pictures and pursued us from town to town her favorite kinds were in this order musicals underwo rlders westerners in the first real singers and dancers had unreal stage careers in an essentially griefproof sphere of existence where from death and truth were banned and where at the end whitehaired dewyeyed technically deathless the initially reluctant father of a showcrazy girl always finished by applauding her apotheosis on fabulous broad way the underworld was a world apart there heroic newspapermen were tortured telephone bills ran to billions and in a robust atmosphere of incompetent marksmanship villains were chased through sewers and storehouses by pathologically fearless cops i was to give themless exercise finally there was the mahogany landscape the floridfaced blueeyed roughriders the prim pretty schoolteacher arriving in roaring gulch the rearing horse the spectacular stampede the pistol thrust through the shivered windowpane the stupendous fist fight the crashing mountain of dusty oldfashioned furniture  the table used as a weapon the timely somersault the pinned hand still groping for the dropped bowi e knife the grunt the sweet crash of fist against chin the kick in the belly  the flying tackle and immediately after a plethora of pain that would have hospitalized a hercules i shou ld know by now nothing to show but the rather becoming bruise on the bronzed cheek of the warmed up hero embracing his gorgeous frontier bride i remember one matinee in a small airless theatre crammed with children and reeking with the hot breath of popcorn the moon was yellow above the neckerchiefed crooner  and his finger was on his strumstring and his foot was on a pine log and i had innocently encircled lo’s shoulder and approached my jawbone to her temple when two harpies behind us started muttering the queerest things—i do not know if i understood aright but what i thought i did made me withdraw my gentle hand and of course the rest of the show was fog to me another jolt i remember is connected with a little burg we were traversing at night during our return journey  some twenty miles earlier i had happened to tell her that the day school she would attend at beardsley was a rather highclass noncoeducational one with no moder n nonsense whereupon lo treated me to one of those furious harangues of hers where entreaty and insult selfassertion and double talk vicious vulgarity and childish despair  were interwoven in an exasperating semblan ce of logic which prompted a semblance of explanation from me enmeshed in her wild words swell chance … i’d be a sap if i took your opinion seriously … stinker … you can’t boss me … i despise you … and so forth i drove through the slumberin g town at a fiftymileper hour pace in continuance of my smooth highway swoosh and a twosome of patrolmen put their spotlight on the car and told me to pull over i shush ed lo who was automatically raving on the men peered at her and me with malevolent curiosity  suddenly all dimples she beamed sweetly at them as she never did at my orchideous masculinity for  in a sense my lo was even more scared of the law than i—and when the kind officers pardoned us and servilely we crawled on her eyelids closed and fluttered as she mimicked limp prostrationat this point i have a curious confession to make you will laugh—but really and truly i somehow never managed to find out quite exactly what the legal situation was i do not know it yet oh i have learned a few odds and ends alabama prohibits a guardian from changing the ward’ s residence without an order of the court minnesota to whom i take off my hat provides that when a relative assumes permanent care and custody of any child under fourteen the autho rity of a court does not come into play query is the stepfather of a gaspingly adorable pubescent pet a stepfather of only one month’s standing a neurotic widower of mature years and small but independent means with the parapets of europe a divorce and a few madhouses behind him is he to be considered a relative and thus a natural guardian and if not must i and could i reasonably dare notify some welfare board and file a petitio n how do you file a petition and have a court’ s agent investigate meek fishy me and dangerous dolores haze the many books on marriage rape adoption and so on that i guilti ly consulted at the public libraries of big and small towns told me nothing beyond darkly insinuating that the state is the super guardian of minor children pilvin and zape l if i remember their names right in an impressive volume on the legal side of marria ge completely ignored stepfathers with motherless girls on their hands and knees my best friend a social service monograph chicago  which was dug out for me at great pains from a dusty storage recess by an innocent old spinster  said “there is no principle that every minor must have a guardian the court is passive and enters the fray only when the child’ s situation becomes conspicuously perilous” a guardian i concluded was appointed only when he expressed his solemn and formal desire but months might elapse before he was given notice to appear at a hearing and grow his pair of gray wings and in the meantime the fair daemon child was legally left to her own devices which after all was the case of dolores haze then came the hearing a few questions from the bench a few reassuring answers from the attorney  a smile a nod a light drizzle outside and the appointment was made and still i dared not keep away  be a mouse curl up in your hole courts became extravag antly active only when there was some moneta ry question involved two greedy guardians a robbed orphan a third kill greedier

any application or would some busybody  some humane society  butt in if i kept too quiet friend farlow  who was a lawyer of sorts and ought to have been able to give me some solid advice was too much occupied with jean’ s cancer to do anything more than what he had promised—namely  to look after charlotte’ s meager estate while i recovered very gradually from the shock of her death i had conditioned him into believing dolores was my natural child and so could not expect him to bother his head about the situation i am as the reader must have gathered by now a poor busine ssman but neither ignorance nor indolence should have prevented me from seeking professional advice elsewhere what stopped me was the awful feeling that if i meddled with fate in any way and tried to rationalize her fantastic gift that gift would be snatched away like that palace on the mountain top in the oriental tale which vanished whenever a prospective owner asked its custodian how come a strip of sunset sky was clearly visible from afar between black rock and foundation i decided that at beardsley the site of beardsley college for women i would have access to works of reference that i had not yet been able to study  such as woerner ’s treatise “on the american law of guardianship” and certain united states child ren’s bureau publications i also decided that anything was better for lo than the demoralizing idleness in which she lived i could persuade her to do so many things—their list might stupefy a professional educator but no matter how i pleaded or stormed i could never make her read any other book than the socalled comic books or stories in magazines for american females any literature a peg higher smacked to her of school and though theoretically willing to enjoy a girl of the limberlost or the arabian nights  or little w omen  she was quite sure she would not fritter away her “vacation” on such highbrow reading matter  i now think it was a great mistake to move east again and have her go to that private school in beardsley  instead of somehow scrambling across the mexican border while the scram bling was good so as to lie low for a couple of years in subtropical bliss until i could safely marry my little creole for i must confess that depending on the condition of my glands and ganglia i could switch in the course of the same day from one pole of insanity to the other—from the thought that around  i would have to get rid somehow of a difficult adolescent whose magic nymphage had evaporated—to the thought that with patience and luck i might have her produce eventually anymphet with my blood in her exquisite veins a lolita the second who would be eight or nine around  when i would still be dans la force de l’âge indeed the telescopy of my

the third the art of being a granddad in the days of that wild journey of ours i doubted not that as father to lolita the first i was a ridiculous failure i did my best i read and reread a book with the unintentionally biblical title know your own daughter  which i got at the same store where i bought lo for her thirteenth birthday  a de luxe volum e with commercially “beautiful” illustrations of andersen’ s the little mermaid  but even at our very best moments when we sat reading on a rainy day lo’s glance skipping from the window to her wrist watch and back again or had a quiet hearty meal in a crowded diner  or played a childis h game of cards  or went shopping or silently stared with other motorists and their children at some smashed bloodbespattered car with a young woman’ s shoe in the ditch lo as we drove on “that was the exact type of moccasin i was trying to describe to that jerk in the store” on all those random occasions i seemed to myself as implausible a father as she seem ed to be a daughter  was perhaps guilty locomotion instrumental in vitiating our powers of impersonation would improvement be forthcoming with a fixed domicile and a routine schoolgirl’ s day in my choice of beardsley i was guided not only by the fact of there being a compara tively sedate school for girls located there but also by the presence of the women’ s college  in my desire to get myself casé to attach myself somehow to some patterned surfac e which my stripes would blend with i thought of a man i knew in the department of french at beardsley college he was good enough to use my textbook in his classes and had attempted to get me over once to deliver a lecture i had no intention of doing so since as i have once remarked in the course of these confessions there are few physiques i loathe more than the heavy lowslung pelvis thick calves and deplorable complexion of the average coed in whom i see maybe the coffin of coarse female flesh within which my nymphets are buried alive but i did crave for a label a background and a simulacrum and as presently will become clear  there was a reason a rather zany reason why old gaston godin’ s company would be particularly safefinally  there was the money question my income was cracking under the strain of our joyride true i clung to the cheaper motor courts but every now and then there would be a loud hotel de luxe or a pretentious dude ranch to mutilate our budget staggering sums moreover  were expended on sightseeing and lo’s clothes and the old haze bus although a still vigorous and very devoted machine necessitated numerous minor and major repairs in one of our strip maps that has happened to survive among the papers which the authorities have so kindly allowed me to use for the purpose of writing my statement i find some jottings that help me compute the following during that extravagant year – august to august lodgings and food cost us around  dollars gas oil and repairs  and various extras almost as much so that during about  days of actual motion we covered about  miles plus some  days of interpolated standstills this modest rentier spent around  dollars or better say   because unpractical as i am i have surely forgotten a number of items and so we rolled east i more devastated than braced with the satisfaction of my passion and she glowing with health her biiliac garland still as brief as a lad’s although she had added two inches to her stature and eight pounds to her weight we had been everywhere we had really seen nothing and i catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely  trustful dreamy  enormous country that by then in retrospe ct was no more to us than a collection of dogeared maps  ruined tour hooks old tires and her sobs in the night— every night every night—the moment i feigned sleep when through decorations of light and shade we drove up to  thayer street a grave little lad met us with the keys and a note from gaston who had rented the house for us my lo without granting her new surroundings one glance unseeingly turned on the radio to which instinct led her and lay down on the living room sofa with a batch of old magazines which in the same precise and blind manner she landed by dipping her hand into the nether anatomy of a lamp table i really did not mind where to dwell provided i could lock my lolita up somewhere but i had i suppose in the course of my correspon dence with vague gaston vaguely visualized a house of ivied brick actually the place bore a dejected resemblance to the haze home a mere  miles distant it was the same sort of dull gray frame affair with a shingled roof and dull green drill awnin gs and the rooms though smaller and furnished in a more consistent plushandplate style were arranged in much the same order  my study turned out to be however  a much larger room lined from floor to ceiling with some two thousand books on chemistry which my landlord on sabbatical leave for the time being taught at beardsley college i had hoped beardsley school for girls an expensive day school with lunch thrown in and a glamorou s gymnasium would while cultivating all those young bodies provide some formal education for their minds as well gaston godin who was seldom right in his judgment of american habitus had warned me that the institution might turn out to be one of those where girls are taught as he put it with a foreigner ’s love for such things “not to spell very well but to smell very well” i don’t think they achieved even that at my first interview with headmistress pratt she approved of my child’ s “nice blue eyes” blue lolita and of my own friendship with that “french genius” a genius gaston—and then having turned dolly over to a miss cormorant she wrinkled her brow in a kind of r ecueillement and said “we are not so much concerned mr humbird with having our students become bookworms or be able to reel off all the capitals of europe whichnobody knows anyway  or learn by heart the dates of for gotten battles what we are concerned with is the adjustment of the child to group life this is why we stress the four d’s dram atics dance debating and dating we are confronted by certain facts your delightful dolly will presently enter an age group where dates dating date dress date book date etique tte mean as much to her as say business business connections business success mean to you or as much as smiling the happiness of my girls means to me dorothy humbir d is already involved in a whole system of social life which consists whether we like it or not of hotdog stands corner drugstores malts and cokes movies squaredancing blanket parties on beaches and even hairfixing parties naturally at beardsley school we disapprove of some of these activities and we rechannel others into more constructive directions but we do try to turn our backs on the fog and squarely face the sunshine to put it briefly  while adopting certain teaching techniques we are more interested in communication than in composition that is with due respect to shakespeare and others we want our girls to communicate freely with the live world around them rather than plunge into musty old books we are still groping perhaps but we grope intelligently  like a gynecologist feeling a tumor  we think dr humbur g in organismal and organizational terms we have done away with the mass of irrelevant topics that have traditionally been presented to young girls leaving no place in former days for the knowledges and the skills and the attitudes they will need in managi ng their lives and—as the cynic might add—the lives of their husbands mr humberson let us put it this way the posit ion of a star is impor tant but the most practical spot for an icebox in the kitchen may be even more impo rtant to the budd ing housewife you say that all you expect a child to obtain from school is a sound education but what do we mean by education in the old days it was in the main a verbal phenomenon i mean you could have a child learn by heart a good encyclopedia and he or she would know as much as or more than a school could offer dr hummer  do you realize that for the modern preadolescent child medieval dates are of less vital value than weekend ones twinkle—to repeat a pun that i heard the beardsley college psychoan alyst permit herself the other day we live not only in a world of thoughts but also in a world of things w ords without experience are meaningless what on earth can dorothy hummerson care for greece and the orient with their harems and slaves”this program rather appalled me but i spoke to two intelligent ladies who had been connected with the school and they affirmed that the girls did quite a bit of sound readin g and that the “communication” line was more or less ballyhoo aimed at giving oldfashioned beardsle y school a financially remunerative modern touch though actually it remai ned as prim as a prawn another reason attracting me to that particular school may seem funny to some readers but it was very important to me for that is the way i am made across our street exactly in front of our house there was i noticed a gap of weedy wasteland with some colorful bushes and a pile of bricks and a few scattered planks and the foam of shabby mauve and chrome autumn roadside flowers and through that gap you could see a shimmery section of school rd running parallel to our thayer st and immediately beyond that the playground of the school apart from the psychological comfort this general arrangemen t should afford me by keeping dolly’ s day adjacent to mine i immediate ly foresaw the pleasure i would have in distinguishing from my studybedroom by means of powerful binoculars the statistically inevitable percentage of nymphets among the other girl children playing around dolly during recess unfortunately  on the very first day of school workmen arrived and put up a fence some way down the gap and in no time a construction of tawny wood maliciously arose beyond that fence utterly blocking my magi c vista and as soon as they had erected a sufficient amou nt of material to spoil everything those absurd builders suspended their work and never appeared again in a street called thayer street in the residential green fawn and golden of a mellow acade mic townlet one was bound to have a few amiable fine dayers yelping at you i prided myself on the exact temperature of my relations with them never rude always aloof my westdoor neighbor  who might have been a businessman or a college teacher  or both would speak to me once in a while as he barbered some late garden blooms or watered his car  or at a later date defrosted his driveway i don’ t mind if these verbs are all wrong but my brief grunts just sufficiently articulate to sound like conventional assents or interrogative pausefillers precluded any evolution toward chummi ness of the two houses flanking the bit of scrubby waste opposite one was closed and the other contained two professors of english tweedy and shorthaired miss lester and fadedly feminine miss fabian whose only subject of brief sidewalk conversation with me was god bless their tact the young loveliness of my daughter and the naive charm of gaston godin my eastdoor neighbor was by far the most dangerous one a sharpnosed character whose late brother had been attached to the college as superintendent of buildings and grounds i remember her waylaying dolly  while i stood at the livingroom window  feverishly await ing my darling’ s return from school the odious spinster  trying to conceal her morbid inquisitiveness under a mask of dulcet goodwill stood leaning on her slim umbrella the sleet had just stopped a cold wet sun had sidled out and dolly  her brown coat open despite the raw weather her structural heap of books pressed against her stomach her knees showing pink above her clumsy wellingtons a sheepish frightened little smile flitting over and off her snubnosed face which—ow ing perhaps to the pale wintry light—loo ked almost plain in a rustic german mägdleinlike way as she stood there and dealt with miss east’ s questions “and where is your mother  my dear and what is your poor father ’s occupation and where did you live before” another time the loathsome creature accosted me with a welcoming whine—but i evaded her and a few days later there came from her a note in a bluemar gined enve lope a nicemixture of poison and treacle suggesting dolly come over on a sunday and curl up in a chair to look through the “loads of beautiful books my dear mother gave me when i was a child instead of having the radio on at full blast till all hours of the night” i had also to be careful in regard to a mrs holigan a charwoman and cook of sorts whom i had inherited with the vacuum cleaner from the previous tenants dolly got lunch at school so that this was no trouble and i had become adept at providin g her with a big breakfast and warming up the dinner that mrs holigan prepared before leaving that kindly and harmless woman had thank god a rather bleary eye that missed details and i had become a great expert in bedmaking but still i was continuously obsessed by the feeling that some fatal stain had been left somewhere or that on the rare occasions where holigan’ s presence happened to coincide with lo’s simple lo might succumb to buxom sympathy in the course of a cozy kitchen chat i often felt we lived in a lighted house of glass and that any moment some thinlipped parchment face would peer through a carelessly unsha ded window to obtain a free glimpse of things that the most jaded voyeur would have paid a small fortune to watch a word about gaston godin the main reason why i enjoyed—or at least tolerated with relief—his comp any was the spell of absolute security that his ample person cast on my secret not that he knew it i had no special reason to confide in him and he was much too selfcentered and abstract to notice or suspect anything that might lead to a frank question on his part and a frank answer on mine he spoke well of me to beardsleyans he was my good herald had he discovered mes goûts and lolita’ s status it would have interested him only insofar as throwing some light on the simplicity of my attitude toward him which attitude was as free of polite strain as it was of ribald allusions for despite his colorless mind and dim memory  he was perhaps aware that i knew more about him than the burghers of beardsley did he was a flabby doughfac ed melancholy bachelor tapering upward to a pair of narrow  not quite level shoulders and a conical pearhead which had sleek black hair on one side and only a few plastered wisps on the other  but the lower part of his body was enormous and he ambulated with a curiou s elephantine stealth by means of phenomenally stout legs he always wore black even his tie was black he seldom bathed his english was a burlesque and noneth eless everybody considered him to be a supremely lovable lovably freakish fellow neighbors pampered him he knew by name all the small boys in our vicinity he lived a few blocks away from me and had some of them clean his sidewalk and burn leaves in his back yard and bring wood from his shed and even perform simple chores about the house and he woul d feed them fancy chocolates with real liqueurs inside—in the privac y of an orientally furnished den in his basement with amusing dagge rs and pistols arrayed on the moldy  rug adorned walls among the camo uflaged hotwater pipes upstai rs he had a studio—he painted a little the old fraud he had decorated its sloping wall it was really not more than a garret with large photographs of pensive andré gide tchaïkovsky  norm an douglas two other wellknown english writers nijinsky all thighs and fig leaves harold d doublename a mistyeyed leftwing professor at a midwestern university and marcelproust all these poor people seemed about to fall on you from their inclined plane he had also an album with snapshots of all the jackies and dickies of the neighborhood and when i happened to thumb through it and make some casual remark gaston would purse his fat lips and murmur with a wistful pout “oui ils sont gentils” his brown eyes would roam around the various sentimental and artistic bricabrac present and his own banal toiles the conventionally primitive eyes sliced guitars blue nipples and geometrical designs of the day and with a vague gesture toward a painted wooden bowl or veined vase he would say “prenez done une de ces poires la bonne dame d’en face men offre plus que je n’en peux savour er” or “mississe taille lore vient de me donner ces dablias belles fleurs que j’exècr e” somber  sad full of worldweariness for obvious reasons i preferred my house to his for the games of chess we had two or three times weekly  he looked like some old battered idol as he sat with his pudgy hands in his lap and stared at the board as if it were a corpse wheezing he would meditate for ten minutes—then make a losing move or the good man after even more thought might utter au roi with a slow olddog woof that had a gargling sound at the back of it which made his jowls wabbl e and then he would lift his circumflex eyebr ows with a deep sigh as i pointed out to him that he was in check himself sometimes from where we sat in my cold study i could hear lo’s bare feet practicing dance techniques in the living room downstairs but gaston’ s outgoing senses were comfortably dulled and he remained unaware of those naked rhythms—andone andtwo andone andtwo weight transferred on a straight right leg leg up and out to the side andone and two and only when she started jumping opening her legs at the height of the jump and flexing one leg and extending the other  and flying and landing on her toes—only then did my pale pompous morose opponent rub his head or cheek as if confusing those distant thuds with the awful stabs of my formidable queen sometimes lola would slouch in while we pondered the board—and it was every time a treat to see gaston his elephant eye still fixed on his pieces ceremoniously rise to shake hands with her and forthwith release her limp fingers  and without looking once at her descend again into his chair to topple into the trap i had laid for him one day around christmas after i had not seen him for a fortnight or so he asked me “et toutes vos fillettes elles vont bien” from which it became evident to me that he hadmultiplied my unique lolita by the number of sartorial categories his downcast mood y eye had glimpsed during a whole series of her appearances blue jeans a skirt shorts a quilted robe i am loath to dwell so long on the poor fellow sadly enough a year later during a voyage to europe from which he did not return he got involved in a sale histoir e in naples of all places i would have hardly alluded to him at all had not his beardsley existe nce had such a queer bearing on my case i need him for my defense there he was devoid of any talent whatsoever  a mediocre teacher  a worthless scholar  a glum repulsive fat old invert highly contempt uous of the american way of life triumphantly ignorant of the engl ish language—there he was in priggish new england crooned over by the old and caressed by the young—oh having a grand time and fooling everybody and here was i i am now faced with the dista steful task of recording a definite drop in lolita’ s morals if her share in the ardors she kindled had neve r amounted to much  neithe r had pure lucre ever come to the fore but i was weak i was not wise my schoolgirl nymphet had me in thrall with the human element dwindl ing the passion the tenderness and the torture only increased and of this she took advantage her weekly allowance paid to her under condition she fulfill her basic obligations was twentyone cents at the start of the beardsley era—and went up to one dollar five before its end this was a more than generous arrangement seeing she constantly received from me all kinds of small presents and had for the asking any sweetmeat or movie under the moon— although of course i might fondly demand an additional kiss or even a whole collection of assorted caresses when i knew she coveted very badly some item of juvenile amusement she was however  not easy to deal with only very listlessly did she earn her three pennies—or three nickels—per day and she proved to be a cruel negotiator whenever it was in her power to deny me certain lifewrecking strange slow paradisal philters without which i could not live more than a few days in a row and which because of the very nature of love’ s languo r i could not obtain by force knowing the magic and might of her own soft mouth she managed—during one schoolyear—to raise the bonus price of a fancy embrace to three and even four bucks o reader laugh not as you imagine me on the very rack of joy noisily emitting dimes and quarters and great big silver dollars like some sonorous jingly and wholly demented machine vomiting riches and in the margin of that leaping epilepsy she would firmly clutch a handful of coins in her little fist which anyway  i used to pry open afterwards unless she gave me the slip scramblin g away to hide her loot and just as every other day i would cruise all around the school area and on comatose feet visit drugstores and peer into foggy lanes and listen to receding girl laughter in between my heart throbs and the falling leaves so every now and then i would burgle her room and scrutinize torn papers in thewastebasket with the painted roses and look under the pillow of the vir ginal bed i had just made myself once i found eight onedollar notes in one of her books fittingly— treasur e island  and once a hole in the wall behind whistler ’s mother yielded as much as twentyfour dollars and some change —say twentyfour sixty—which i quietly removed upon which next day she accused to my face honest mrs holigan of being a filthy thief eventually  she lived up to her iq by finding a safer hoarding place which i never discovered but by that time i had brought prices down drastically by having her earn the hard and nauseous way permission to participate in the school’ s theatrical program because what i feared most was not that she might ruin me but that she might accumulate sufficient cash to run away  i believe the poor fierceeyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty dollars in her purse she might somehow reach broadway or hollywood—or the foul kitchen of a diner help wanted in a dismal exprairie state with the wind blowing and the stars blinking and the cars and the bars and the barmen and everything soiled torn dead i did my best your honor  to tackle the problem of boys oh i used even to read in the beardsley star a socalled colu mn for teens to find out how to behave a word to fathe rs don’ t frighten away daughter ’s friend maybe it is a bit hard for you to realiz e that now the boys are finding her attractive to you she is still a little girl to the boys she’s charming and fun lovely and gay they like her today you clinch big deals in an executive’ s office but yesterday you were just highschool jim carrying jane’ s school books remember don’ t you want your daughter  now that her turn has come to be happy in the admiration and company of boys she likes don’ t you want them to have wholesome fun together wholesome fun good lord why not treat the young fellows as guests in your house why not make conversati on with them draw them out make them laugh and feel at ease welcome fellow  to this bordello if she breaks the rules don’t explode out loud in front of her partner in crime let her take the brunt of your displeasure in private and stop making the boys feel she’ s the daughter of an old ogre first of all the old ogre drew up a list under “absolutely forbidden” and another under “reluctantly allowed” absolutely forbidden were dates single or double or triple—the next step being of course mass orgy she might visit a candy bar with her girl friends and there giggl echat with occasional young males while i waited in the car at a discreet distance and i promised her that if her group were invited by a socially acceptable groupin butle r’s academy for boys for their annual ball heavily chaperoned of course i might consider the question whether a girl of fourteen can don her first “formal” a kind of gown that makes thinarmed teenage rs look like flamingoes moreover  i promised her to throw a party at our house to which she would be allowed to invite her prettier girl friends and the nicer boys she would have met by that time at the butler dance but i was quite positive that as long as my regime lasted she would never  never be permitted to go with a youngste r in rut to a movie or neck in a car or go to boygirl parties at the houses of schoolmates or indulge out of my earshot in boygirl telephone conversat ions even if “only discussing his relations with a friend of mine” lo was enraged by all this—called me a lousy crook and wors e—and i would probably have lost my temper had i not soon discovered to my sweetest relief that what really angered her was my depriving her not of a specific satisfaction but of a general right i was impinging you see on the conventional program the stock pastimes the “things that are done” the routine of youth for there is nothing more conservative than a child especially a girlchild be she the most auburn and russet the most mythopoeic nymphet in october ’s orchardhaze do not misund erstand me i cannot be absolutely certain that in the course of the winter she did not manage to have in a casual way improper contacts with unknown young fellows of course no matter how closely i controlled her leisure there would constantly occur unaccountedfor time leaks with overelaborate expla nations to stop them up in retrospect of course my jealousy would constantly catch its jagged claw in the fine fabrics of nymphet falsity but i did definitely feel—and can now vouchsafe for the accuracy of my feeling—that there was no reason for serious alarm i felt that way not because i never once discovered any palpable hard young throat to crush among the masculine mutes that flickered somew here in the background but because it was to me “overwhelmingly obvious” a favorite express ion with my aunt sybil that all varieties of high school boys—from the perspiring nincompoop whom “holding hands” thrills to the selfsuf ficien t rapist with pustules and a soupedup car—equally bored my soph isticated young mistres s “all this noise about boys gags me” she had scrawled on the inside of a schoolbook and underneath  in mona’ s hand mona is due any minute now there was the sly quip “what about rigger” due toofaceless then are the chappies i happened to see in her compa ny there was for instance red sweater who one day the day we had the first snow— saw her home from the parlor window i observed them talking near our porch she wore her first cloth coat with a fur collar there was a small brown cap on my favorite haird o—the fringe in front and the swirl at the sides and the natural curls at the back—and her dampdark moccasins and white socks were more sloppy than ever she pressed as usual her books to her chest while speaking or listening and her feet gestured all the time she would stand on her left instep with her right toe remove it backward cross her feet rock slightly  sketch a few steps and then start the series all over again there was windbreaker who talked to her in front of a restaurant one sunday afternoon while his mother and sister attempted to walk me away for a chat i dragged along and looked back at my only love she had developed more than one conventional mannerism such as the polite adolescent way of showing one is literally “doubled up” with laughter by inclining one’s head and so as she sensed my call still feign ing helpless merriment she walked backward a couple of steps and then faced about and walked toward me with a fading smile on the other hand i greatly liked—perhaps because it reminded me of her first unfor gettable confession —her trick of sighing “oh dear” in humorous wistful submissio n to fate or emitting a long “noo” in a deep almost growling undertone when the blow of fate had actua lly fallen above all—since we are speaking of movement and youth—i liked to see her spinning up and down thayer street on her beautiful young bicycle rising on the pedals to work on them lustily  then sinking back in a languid posture while the speed wore itself off and then she would stop at our mailbox and still astride would flip through a magazine she found there and put it back and press her tongue to one side of her upperlip and push off with her foot and again sprint through pale shade and sun on the whole she seemed to me better adapted to her surroundings than i had hoped she would be when considering my spoiled slavec hild and the bangles of demeanor she naïve ly affected the winter before in california although i could never get used to the constant state of anxiety in which the guilty  the great the tenderhear ted live i felt i was doing my best in the way of mimicry  as i lay on my narrow studio

likes—the great clan of intraraci al redheads nor did she sport their green uniform but wore as i remember her a lot of black or cherry dark—a very smart black pullover  for instance and highheeled black shoes and garnetred fingernail polish  i spoke french to her much to lo’s disgust the child’ s tonalities were still admirably pure but for school words and play words she resorted to current american and then a slight brooklyn accent would crop up in her speech which was amusing in a little parisian who went to a select new england school with phoney british aspirations unfortunately  despite “that french kid’s uncle” being “a millionaire” lo dropped eva for some reason before i had had time to enjoy in my modest way her fragrant presence in the humbert open house the reader knows what importance i attached to having a bevy of page girls consolation prize nymph ets aroundmy lolita for a while i endeavored to interest my senses in mona dahl who was a good deal around especially during the spring term when lo and she got so enthusiastic about dramatics i have often wondered what secrets outrageously treacherous dolores haze had imparted to mona while blurting out to me by urgent and wellpaid request various really incredible details concernin g an affair that mona had had with a marine at the seaside it was character istic of lo that she chose for her closest chum that elegant cold lascivious experienced young female whom i once heard misheard lo swore cheerfully say in the hallway to lo—who had remarked that her lo’s sweater was of virgin wool “the only thing about you that is kiddo …” she had a curiously husky voice artificially waved dull dark hair  earrings amber brown prominent eyes and luscious lips lo said teachers had remonstrate d with her on her loading herself with so much costume jewelry  her hands trembled she was burdened with a  iq and i also know she had a tremendous chocolatebrown mole on her womanish back which i inspected the night lo and she had worn lowcut pastelcolored vaporous dresses for a dance at the butler academy  i am anticipating a little but i cannot help running my memory all over the keyb oard of that school year in meeting my attempts to find out what kind of boys lo knew  miss dahl was elegantly evasive lo who had gone to play tennis at linda’ s country club had telephoned she might be a full half hour late and so would i entertain mona who was coming to practice with her a scene from the taming of the shrew using all the modulations all the allure of manner and voice she was capable of and staring at me with perhaps—could i be mistaken—a faint gleam of crystalline irony  beautiful mona replied “well sir the fact is dolly is not much concerne d with mere boys fact is we are rivals she and i have a crush on the reverend rigger ” this was a joke—i have already mentioned that gloom y giant of a man with the jaw of a horse he was to bore me to near murder with his impressions of switzerland at a tea party for parents that i am unable to place correctly in terms of time how had the ball been oh it had been a riot a what a panic  terrific in a word had lo danced a lot oh not a frightful lot just as much as she could stand what did she languorous mona think of lo sir did she think lo was doing well at school gosh she certainly was quite a kid but her general behavior was— oh she was a swell kid but still “oh she’s a doll” concluded mona and sighed abruptly  and picked up a book thathappened to lie at hand and with a change of expression falsely furrowing her brow  inquired “do tell me about ball zack sir is he really that good” she moved up so close to my chair that i made out through lotions and creams her uninteresting skin scent a sudden odd thought stabb ed me was my lo playing the pimp if so she had found the wrong substitute avoiding mona’ s cool gaze i talked literature for a minute then dolly arrived—and slit her pale eyes at us i left the two friends to their own devices one of the latticed squares in a small cobwebby casement window at the turn of the staircase was glazed with ruby and that raw wound among the unstained rectangles and its asymmetrical position—a knight’ s move from the top—always strangely disturbed me  sometimes … come on how often exactly  bert can you recall four five more such occasions or would no human heart have survived two or three sometimes i have nothing to say in reply to your question while lolita would be haphazardly preparing her homework suckin g a pencil lolling sideways in an easy chair with both legs over its arm i would shed all my pedagogi c restraint dismiss all our quarrels forget all my masculine pride—and litera lly crawl on my knees to your chair  my lolita you would give me one look—a gray furry question mark of a look “oh no not again” incredulity  exasperation for you never deigned to believe that i could without any specific designs ever crave to bury my face in your plaid skirt my darling the fragility of those bare arms of yours–how i longed to enfold them all your four limpi d lovely limbs a folded colt and take your head between my unworthy hands and pull the templeskin back on both sides and kiss your chinesed eyes and—“pulease leave me alone will you” you would say “for chris t’s sake leave me alone” and i would get up from the floor while you looked on your face deliberately twitching in imitation of my tic nerveux  but never mind never mind i am only a brute never mind let us go on with my miserable story   one monday forenoon in december i think pratt asked me to come over for a talk dolly’s last report had been poor i knew  but instead of contenting myself with some such plausible explanation of this summons i imagined all sorts of horrors and had to fortify myself with a pint of my “pin” before i could face the interview  slowly  all adam’ s apple and heart i went up the steps of the scaf fold a huge woman grayhaired frowsy  with a broad flat nose and small eyes behind blackrimmed glasses—“sit down” she said pointing to an informal and humiliating hassock while she perched with ponderous spryness on the arm of an oak chair  for a moment or two she peered at me with smiling curiosity  she had done it at our first meeting i recalled but i could afford then to scowl back her eye left me she lapsed into thought— probably assume d making up her mind she rubbed fold on fold her dark gray flannel skirt at the knee dispelling a trace of chalk or some thing then she said still rubbing not looking up “let me ask a blunt question mr haze you are an oldfashioned continental father  aren’ t you” “why  no” i said “conservative  perhaps but not what you would call oldfashioned” she sighed frowned then clapped her big plump hands together in a let’sgetdowntobusiness manner  and again fixed her beady eyes upon me “dolly haze” she said “is a lovely child but the onset of sexual maturing seems to give her trouble” i bowed slightly  what else could i do “she is still shuttling” said miss pratt showing how with her liver spotted hands “between the anal and genital zones of development basically she is a lovely—” “i beg your pardon” i said “what zones” “that’ s the oldfashioned euro pean in you” cried pratt delivering a slight tap on my wrist watch and suddenly disclosing her dentures “all imean is that biologic and psychologic drives—do you smok e—are not fused in dolly  do not fall so to speak into a—into a rounded pattern” her hands held for a moment an invisible melon “she is attractive bright though careless” breathing heavily  without leaving her perch the woman took time out to look at the lovely child’ s report sheet on the desk at her right “her marks are getting worse and worse now i wonder  mr haze—” again the false meditation “well” she went on with zest “as for me i do smoke and as dear dr pierce used to say i’m not proud of it but i jeest love it” she lit up and the smoke she exhaled from her nostrils was like a pair of tusks “let me give you a few details it won’ t take a moment now let me see rummaging among her papers she is defiant toward miss redcock and impossibly rude to miss cormorant now here is one of our special research reports enjoys singing with group in class though mind seems to wander  crosses her knees and wags left leg to rhythm type of bywords a two hundredfortytwo word area of the commonest pubescent slang fenced in by a number of obviously european polysyllables sighs a good deal in class let me see yes now comes the last week in novemb er sighs a good deal in class chews gum vehemently  does not bite her nails though if she did this would conform better to her general pattern—scientifically speaking of course menstruation according to the subject well established belongs at present to no church organization by the way mr haze her mother was— oh i see and you are— nobody’ s business is i suppose god’ s business some thing else we wanted to know  she has no regular home duties i understand making a princess of your dolly  mr haze eh well what else have we got here handles books gracefully  voice pleasant giggles rather often a littly dreamy  has private jokes of her own transp osing for instance the first letters of some of her teachers’ names hair light and dark brow n lustrous—well laughing you are aware of that i suppo se nose unobstructed feet higharched eyes—let me see i had here somewhere a still more recent report aha here we are miss gold says dolly’s tennis form is excellent to superb even better than linda hall’ s but concentration and pointaccumulation are just “poor to fair” miss cormorant cannot decide whether dolly has exceptional emotional control or none at all miss horn reports she—i mean dolly—cannot verbalize her emotions while according to miss cole dolly’ s metabolic efficiency is superfine miss molar thinks dolly is myopic and should see agood ophthalmo logist but miss redcock insists that the girl simulates eye strain to get away with schola stic incompetence and to conclude mr haze our researchers are wonde ring about something really crucial now i want to ask you something i want to know if your poor wife or yourself or anyone else in the family—i understand she has several aunts and a maternal grandfather in california—oh had—i’m sorry—w ell we all wonder if anybody in the family has instructed dolly in the process of mammalian reproduction the general impression is that fifteenyear old dolly remains morbidly uninte rested in sexual matters or to be exact represses her curiosity in order to save her ignorance and selfdignity  all right—fourteen you see mr haze beardsley school does not believe in bees and blossoms and storks and love birds but it does believe very strongly in preparing its stude nts for mutually satisfactory mating and successful child rearing we feel dolly could make excellent progress if only she would put her mind to her work miss cormorant’ s report is significant in that respect dolly is inclined to be mildly speaking impudent but all feel that primo  you should have your family doctor tell her the facts of life and secundo  that you allow her to enjoy the company of her schoolmates’ brothers at the junior club or in dr rigger ’s organization or in the lovely homes of our parents” “she may meet boys at her own lovely home” i said “i hope she will” said pratt buoyantly  “ ‘when we questioned her about her troubles dolly refused to discuss the home situation but we have spoken to some of her friends and really—well for example we insist you unveto her nonparticipation in the dramatic group you just must allow her to take part in the hunted enchanters  she was such a perfect little nymph in the tryout and sometime in spring the author will stay for a few days at beardsley college and may attend a rehearsal or two in our new auditorium i mean it is all part of the fun of being young and alive and beautiful you must understand—” “i always thought of myself” i said “as a very understanding father ” “oh no doubt no doubt but miss cormorant thinks and i am inclined to agree with her that dolly is obsessed by sexual thoughts for which she finds no outlet and will tease and martyrize other girls or even our younger instructors because they do have innocent dates with boys” shrugged my shoulders a shabby émigré “let us put our two heads together  mr haze what on earth is wrong with that child” “she seems quite normal and happy to me” i said disaster coming at last was i found out had they got some hypnotist “what worries me” said miss pratt looking at her watch and starting to go over the whole subject again “is that both teachers and schoolmates find dolly antagonistic dissatisfied cagey—and everybody wonders why you are so firmly opposed to all the natural recreations of a normal child” “do you mean sex play” i asked jauntily  in despair  a cornered old rat “well i certainly welcome this civilized terminology ” said pratt with a grin “but this is not quite the point under the auspices of beardsley school dramatics dances and other natural activities are not technically sex play though girls do meet boys if that is what you object to” “all right” i said my hassock exhaling a weary sigh “you win she can take part in that play  provided male parts are taken by female parts” “i am always fascinated” said pratt “by the admirable way foreigners— or at least natur alized americans—use our rich language i’m sure miss gold who conducts the play group will be overjoyed i notice she is one of the few teachers that seem to like—i mean who seem to find dolly manageable this takes care of general topics i guess now comes a special matter  we are in trouble again” pratt paused truculently  then rubbed her index finger under her nostrils with such vigor that her nose performed a kind of war dance “i’m a frank person” she said “but conventions are conventio ns and i find it difficult … let me put it this way … the walkers who live in what we call around here the duke’ s manor  you know the great gray house on the hill— they send their two girls to our school and we have the niece of president moore with us a really gracious child not to speak of a number of other prominent children well under the circumstances it is rather a jolt when dolly  who looks like a little lady uses words which you as a foreigner probably simply do not know or do not understand perhaps it might be better—w ould you like me to have dolly come up here right away to discuss things no you see— oh well let’s have it out dolly has written a most obscene fourletter word which our dr cutler tells me is low mexican for urinal with her lipstick on some health pamphlets which miss redcock who is getting marrie d in june distributed among the girls andwe thought she should stay after hours—another half hour at least but if you like—” “no” i said “i don’t want to interfere with rules i shall talk to her later i shall thrash it out” “do” said the woman rising from her chair arm “and perhaps we can get together again soon and if things do not improve we might have dr cutler analyze her ” should i marry pratt and strangle her “… and perhaps your family doctor might like to examine her physically —just a routine checkup she is in mushroom—the last classroom along that passage” beardsley school it may be explained copied a famous girls’ school in england by having “traditional” nicknames for its various classrooms mushroom roomin  broom roomba and so on mushroom was smelly  with a sepia print of reynolds’ “age of innocence” above the chalkboard and several rows of clumsylooking pupil desks at one of these my lolita was reading the chapter on “dialogue” in baker ’s dramatic t echnique  and all was very quiet and there was another girl with a very naked porcelainwhite neck and wonderful platinum hair who sat in front reading too absolutely lost to the world and interminabl y winding a soft curl around one finger  and i sat beside dolly just behind that neck and that hair and unbuttoned my overcoat and for sixtyfive cents plus the permission to participate in the school play had dolly put her inky chalky  redknuckled hand under the desk oh stupid and reckless of me no doubt but after the torture i had been subjected to i simply had to take advantage of a combination that i knew would never occur again  around christm as she caught a bad chill and was examined by a friend of miss lester a dr ilse tristramson hi ilse you were a dear uninquisitive soul and you touched my dove very gently she diagnosed bronchitis patted lo on the back all its bloom erect because of the fever and put her to bed for a week or longer  at first she “ran a temperature” in american parlance and i could not resist the exquisite caloricity of unexpected delights— venus febriculosa—though it was a very languid lolita that moaned and coughed and shiver ed in my embrace and as soon as she was well again i threw a party with boys perhaps i had drunk a little too much in preparation for the ordeal perhaps i made a fool of mysel f the girls had decorated and plugged in a small fir tree—german custom  except that colored bulbs had superseded wax candles records were chosen and fed into my landlord’ s phonograph chic dolly wore a nice gray dress with fitted bodice and flared skirt humming i retired to my study upstairs—and then every ten or twenty minutes i would come down like an idiot just for a few seconds to pick up ostensibly my pipe from the mantelpiece or hunt for the newspaper and with every new visit these simple actions became harder to perform and i was reminded of the dreadfully distant days when i used to brace myself to casually enter a room in the ramsdale house where little carmen was on the party was not a success of the three girls invited one did not come at all and one of the boys brought his cousin roy  so there was a superfluity of two boys and the cousins knew all the steps and the other fellows could hardly dance at all and most of the evening was spent in messing up the kitchen and then endlessly jabbering about what card game to play and sometime later two girls and four boys sat on the floor of the living room with all window s open and played a word game which opal could not be made to understand while mona and roy a lean handsome lad drank ginger ale in the kitchen sitting on the table and dangling their legs and hotly discussing predestination and the law of averages after they had all gone my lo said ugh closed her eyes and dropped into a chair with all fourlimbs starfished to express the utmost disgust and exhaustion and swore it was the most revolting bunch of boys she had ever seen i bought her a new tennis racket for that remark january was humid and warm and february fooled the forsythia  none of the townspeople had ever seen such weather  other presents came tumbling in for her birthday i bought her a bicycle the doelike and altogether charming machine already mentioned—and added to this a history of modern american fainting  her bicycle manner i mean her approach to it the hip movement in mounting the grace and so on afforded me supreme pleasure but my attempt to refine her pictorial taste was a failure she wanted to know if the guy noonnapping on doris lee’s hay was the father of the pseudo voluptuous hoyden in the foreground and could not understand why i said grant wood or peter hurd was good and reginald marsh or frederick w augh awful  by the time spring had touched up thayer street with yellow and green and pink lolita was irrevocably stagestruck pratt whom i chanced to notice one sunday lunching with some people at walton inn caught my eye from afar and went through the motion of sympathetically and discreetly clapping her hands while lo was not looking i detest the theatre as being a primitive and putrid form historically speaking a form that smacks of stoneage rites and communal nonsense despite those individual injections of geniu s such as say elizabethan poetry which a closeted reader automatically pumps out of the stuff being much occupied at the time with my own literary labors i did not bother to read the complete text of the enchanted hunters  the playlet in which dolores haze was assigned the part of a farmer’s daughter who imagin es herself to be a woodland witch or diana or somet hing and who having got hold of a book on hypnotism plunges a number of lost hunters into various entertaining trances before falling in her turn under the spell of a vagabond poet mona dahl that much i gleaned from bits of crumpled and poorly typed script that lo sowed all over the house the coincidence of the title with the name of an unfor gettable inn was pleasant in a sad little way i wearily thought i had better not bring it to my own enchantress’ s notice lest a brazen accusation of mawkishness hurt me even more than her failure to notice it for herself had done i assumed the playle t was just another  practically anonymous version of some banal legend nothing prevented one of course from supposing that in quest of an attractive name the founder of the hotel had been immediately and solely influenced by the chance fantasy of the secondrate muralist he had hired and that subsequently the hotel’s name had suggested the play’ s title but in my credulous simple benevolent mind i happened to twist it the other way round and without giving the whole matter much thought really  supposed that mural name and title had all been derived from a common source from some local tradition which i an alien unverse d in new england lore would not be supposed to know  in consequence i was under the impression all this quite casually  youunderstand quite outside any orbit of importance that the accursed playlet belonged to the type of whims ey for juvenile consumption arranged and rearranged many times such as hansel and gretel by richard roe or the sleeping beauty by dorothy doe or the emper or’s new clothes by maurice vermon t and marion rumpelmeyer—all this to be found in any plays for schoo l actors or let’s have a play in other words i did not know—and would not have cared if i did—that actually the enchanted hunters was a quite recent and technically original composition which had been produced for the first time only three or four months ago by a highbrow group in new york to me—inasmuch as i could judge from my charmer ’s part—it seemed to be a pretty dismal kind of fancy work with echoes from lenormand and maeterlinck and various quiet british dreamers the redcapped uniformly attired hunters of which one was a banker  another a plumber  a third a policeman a fourth an undertaker  a fifth an underwr iter a sixth an escaped convict you see the possibilities went through a complete chang e of mind in dolly’ s dell and remembered their real lives only as dreams or nightmares from which little diana had aroused them but a sevent h hunter in a green cap the fool was a young poet and he insisted much to diana’ s annoyance that she and the entertainment provided dancing nymphs and elves and mons ters were his the poet’ s invention i understand that finally  in utter disgust at this cocksureness barefooted dolore s was to lead checktrousered mona to the paternal farm behind the perilous forest to prove to the braggard she was not a poet’ s fancy  but a rustic downtobrownearth lass—and a last minute kiss was to enforce the play’ s profound message namely  that mirage and reality merge in love i considered it wiser not to criticize the thing in front of lo she was so healthily engrossed in “problems of expression” and so charmingly did she put her narrow flore ntine hands together  batting her eyelashes and pleading with me not to come to rehearsals as some ridiculous parents did because she wanted to dazzle me with a perfect first night—and because i was anyway  alway s butting in and saying the wron g thing and cram ping her style in the presence of other people there was one very special rehearsal … my heart my heart … there was one day in may marked by a lot of gay flurry—it all rolled past beyond my ken immune to my memory  and when i saw lo next in the late afternoon balancing on her bike pressing the palm of her hand to the damp bark of ayoung birch tree on the edge of our lawn i was so struck by the radiant tenderness of her smile that for an instant i believed all our troubles gone “can you remem ber” she said “what was the name of that hotel you know nose puckered  come on you know—with those white columns and the marble swan in the lobby oh you know noisy exhalation of breath—the hotel where you raped me okay skip it i mean was it almost in a whisper the enchanted hunters oh it was musingly was it”—and with a yelp of amorous vernal laughter she slapped the glossy bole and tore uphill to the end of the street and then rode back feet at rest on stopped pedals posture relaxed one hand dreaming in her printflowered lap  because it supposedly tied up with her interest in dance and dramatics i had permitted lo to take piano lessons with a miss emperor as we french scholars may conveniently call her to whose blueshuttered little white house a mile or so beyond beardsley lo would spin off twice a week one friday night toward the end of may and a week or so after the very special rehearsal lo had not had me attend the telephone in my study  where i was in the act of mopping up gustave’ s—i mean gaston’ s—king’ s side rang and miss emperor asked if lo was coming next tuesday because she had missed last tuesday’s and today’ s lessons i said she would by all means— and went on with the game as the reader may well imagine my faculties were now impaired and a move or two later with gaston to play i noticed through the film of my general distress that he could collect my queen he noticed it too but thinking it might be a trap on the part of his tricky opponent he demurred for quite a minute and puffed and wheezed and shook his jowls and even shot furtive glances at me and made hesitating halfthrusts with his pudgily bunched fingers—dying to take that juicy queen and not daring—and all of a sudden he swooped down upon it who knows if it did not teach him certain later audacities and i spent a dreary hour in achieving a draw  he finished his brandy and presentl y lumbered away  quite satisfied with this result mon pauvre ami je ne vous ai jamais revu et quoiqu’il y ait bien peu de chance que vous voyiez mon livre permettezmoi de vous dire que je vous serre la main bien cordialement et que toutes mes fillettes vous saluent i found dolores haze at the kitchen table consumin g a wedge of pie with her eyes fixed on her script they rose to meet mine with a kind of celestial vapidity  she remained singularly unruf fled when confronted with my discovery  and said d’un petit air faussement contrit that she knew she was a very wicked kid but simply had not been able to resist the encha ntment and had used up those music hours —o reader  my reader—in a nearby public park rehearsing the magic forest scene with mona i said “fine”—and stalked to the telephone mona’ s mother answere d “oh yes she’s in” and retreated with a mother ’s neutrallaugh of polite pleasure to shou t off stage “roy calling” and the very next moment mona rustled up and forthwith in a low monotonous not untender voice started berating roy for something he had said or done and i interrupted her and presently mona was saying in her humblest sexiest contralto “yes sir” “surely  sir” “i am alone to blame sir in this unfortunate business” what elocution what poise “honest i feel very bad about it”—and so on and so forth as those little harlots say  so down stairs i went clearing my throat and holding my heart  lo was now in the living room in her favorite overstuf fed chair  as she sprawled there biting at a hangnail and mocking me with her heartless vaporous eyes and all the time rocking a stool upon which she had placed the heel of an outstretched shoeless foot i perceived all at once with a sickening qualm how much she had changed since i first met her two years ago or had this happened durin g those last two weeks tendresse surely that was an exploded myth she sat right in the focus of my incandescent anger  the fog of all lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dread ful lucidity  oh she had changed her complexion was now that of any vulgar untidy highschool girl who applies shared cosmetics with grubby fingers to an unwashed face and does not mind what soiled texture what pustulate epidermis comes in contact with her skin its smooth tender bloom had been so lovely in form er days so bright with tears when i used to roll in play her tousled head on my knee a coarse flush had now replaced that innocent fluorescence what was locally known as a “rabbit cold” had painted with flaming pink the edges of her contemptuous nostrils as in terror i lowered my gaze it mechanically slid along the underside of her tense ly stretched bare thigh—how polished and muscular her legs had grown she kept her wideset eyes cloudedglass gray and slightly bloodshot fixed upon me and i saw the stealthy thought showing through them that perhaps after all mona was right and she orphan lo could expose me without getting penalized hersel f how wrong i was how mad i was everything about her was of the same exasperating impenetrable order—the stren gth of her shapely legs the dirty sole of her white sock the thick sweater she wore despite the closeness of the room her wenchy smell and especially the dead end of her face with its strange flush and freshly madeup lips some of the red had left stains on her front teeth and i was struck by a ghastly recollection—the evoked image not of monique but of another young prostitute in a bellhouse ages ago who had been snapped up by somebodyelse before i had time to decide whether her mere youth warranted my risking some appalling disease and who had just such flushed prominent pommettes and a dead maman  and big front teeth and a bit of dingy red ribbon in her countrybrown hair  “well speak” said lo “w as the corroboration satisfactory” “oh yes” i said “perfect yes and i do not doubt you two made it up as a matter of fact i do not doubt you have told her everything about us” “oh yah” i controlled my breath and said “dolores this must stop right away  i am ready to yank you out of beardsley and lock you up you know where but this must stop i am ready to take you away the time it takes to pack a suitcase this must stop or else anything may happen” “anything may happen huh” i snatche d away the stool she was rocking with her heel and her foot fell with a thud on the floor  “hey ” she cried “take it easy ” “first of all you go upstairs” i cried in my turn—and simul taneously grabbed at her and pulled her up from that moment i stopped restraining my voice and we continued yelling at each other  and she said unprintable things she said she loathed me she made monstrous faces at me inflating her cheeks and producing a diabolical plopping sound she said i had attempted to violate her several times when i was her mother ’s roomer  she said she was sure i had murdere d her mother  she said she would sleep with the very first fellow who asked her and i could do nothing about it i said she was to go upstairs and show me all her hiding places it was a strident and hateful scene i held her by her knobby wrist and she kept turning and twisting it this way and that surreptitiously trying to find a weak point so as to wrench herself free at a favorable moment but i held her quite hard and in fact hurt her rather badly for which i hope my heart may rot and once or twice she jerked her arm so violently that i feared her wrist might snap and all the while she stared at me with those unfor gettable eyes where cold anger and hot tears struggled and our voices were drowning the telephone and when i grew aware of its ringing she instantly escaped with people in movies i seem to share the services of the machina telephonica and its sudden god this time it was an irate neighbor  the east window happene d to be agape in the living room with the blind mercifully down however and behind it the damp black night of a sour new englandspring had been breathlessly listening to us i had always thought that type of haddocky spinst er with the obscene mind was the result of considerable literary inbreeding in modern fiction but now i am convinced that prude and prurient miss east—or to explode her incognito miss fenton lebone —had been probably protruding threequarter way from her bedroom window as she strove to catch the gist of our quarrel “… this racket … lacks all sense of …” quacked the receiver  “we do not live in a tenement here i must emphatically …” i apologized for my daughter ’s friends being so loud young people you know—and cradled the next quack and a half downstairs the screen door banged lo escaped through the casement on the stairs i saw a small impetuous ghost slip through the shrubs a silvery dot in the dark—hub of bicycle wheel— moved shivered and she was gone it so happened that the car was spending the night in a repair shop downtown i had no other alternative than to pursue on foot the winged fugitive even now after more than three years have heaved and elapsed i cannot visualize that springnight street that already so leafy street without a gasp of panic before their lighted porch miss lester was promenading miss fabian’ s dropsical dackel mr hyde almost knocked it over walk three steps and run three a tepid rain started to drum on the chestnut leaves at the next corner  pressing lolita against an iron railing a blurred youth held and kissed—no not her mistake my talons still tingling i flew on half a mile or so east of number fourteen thayer street tangles with a private lane and a cross street the latter leads to the town proper  in front of the first drugstore i saw—w ith what melody of relief—lolita’ s fair bicycle waiting for her i pushed instead of pulling pulled pushed pulled and entered look out some ten paces away lolita through the glass of a telephone booth membranous god still with us cupping the tube confidentially hunched over it slit her eyes at me turned away with her treasure hurriedly hung up and walked out with a flourish “tried to reach you at home” she said brightly  “a great decision has been made but first buy me a drink dad” she watched the listless pale fountain girl put in the ice pour in the coke add the cherry syrup—and my heart was bursting with loveache that childish wrist my lovely child you have a lovely child mr humbert wealways admire her as she passes by mr pim watched pippa suck in the concoction j’ai toujours admiré i’oeuvr e ormonde du sublime dublinois  and in the meantime the rain had become a voluptuous shower  “look” she said as she rode the bike beside me one foot scraping the darkly glistening sidewalk “look i’ve decided something i want to leave school i hate that school i hate the play i really do never go back find another  leave at once go for a long trip again but this time we’ll go wherever i want won’ t we” i nodded my lolita “i choose c’est entendu ” she asked wobbling a little beside me used french only when she was a very good little girl “okay  entendu  now hophop hop lenore or you’ll get soaked” a storm of sobs was filling my chest she bared her teeth and after her adorable schoolgirl fashion leaned forward and away she sped my bird miss lester’s finely groomed hand held a porchdoor open for a waddling old dog qui pr enait son temps  lo was waiting for me near the ghostly birch tree “i am drenched” she declared at the top of her voice “are you glad to hell with the play see what i mean” an invisible hag’ s claw slammed down an upper floor window  in our hallway  ablaze with welcoming lights my lolita peeled off her sweater  shook her gemmed hair stretched towards me two bare arms raised one knee “carry me upstairs please i feel sort of romantic tonight” it may interest physiologists to learn at this point that i have the ability —a most singular case i presum e—of shedding torrents of tears throughout the other tempest  the brakes were relined the waterpipes unclogged the valves ground and a numbe r of other repairs and improvements were paid for by not very mechanicallyminded but prudent papa humbert so that the late mrs humbert’ s car was in respectable shape when ready to undertake a new journey  we had promised beardsley school good old beardsley school that we would be back as soon as my hollywood engagement came to an end inventive humbert was to be i hinted chief consultant in the production of a film dealing with “existentialism” still a hot thing at the time actually i was toying with the idea of gently trickling across the mexican border—i was braver now than last year— and there deciding what to do with my little concubine who was now sixty inches tall and weighed ninety pounds we had dug out our tour books and maps she had traced our route with immense zest was it thanks to those theatricals that she had now outgrown her juvenile jaded airs and was so adorably keen to explore rich reality i experienced the queer lightness of dreams that pale but warm sunday morning when we abandoned professor chem’ s puzzled hous e and sped along main street toward the fourlane highway  my love’ s striped black andwhite cotto n frock jaunty blue cap white socks and brown moccasins were not quite in keeping with the large beautifully cut aquamarine on a silver chainlet which gemmed her throat a spring rain gift from me we passed the new hotel and she laughed “a penny for your thoughts” i said and she stretched out her palm at once but at that moment i had to apply the brakes rather abruptly at a red light as we pulled up anoth er car came to a gliding stop alongside and a very striking looking athletically lean young woman where had i seen her with a high comp lexion and shoulder length brilliant bronze hair greeted lo with a ringing “hi”—and then addressing me ef fusively  edusively placed stressing certain words said “what a shame it was to tear dolly away from the play—you should have hear d the author raving about her after that rehearsal— ” “green light you dope” said lo under her breath and simultaneously  waving in brightadieu a bangled arm joan of arc in a performance we saw at the local theatre violently outdistanced us to swerve into campus a venue “who was it exactly v ermont or rumpelmeyer” “no— edusa gold—the gal who coaches us” “i was not referring to her  who exactly concocted that play” “oh yes of course some old woman clare something i guess there was quite a crowd of them there” “so she complimented you” “complimented my eye—she kissed me on my pure brow”—and my darling emitted that new yelp of merriment which—perhaps in connection with her theatrical mannerisms—she had lately begun to af fect “you are a funny creature lolita” i said—or some such words “naturally  i am overjoyed you gave up that absurd stage business but what is curious is that you dropped the whole thing only a week before its natural climax oh lolita you should be careful of those surrenders of yours i remember you gave up ramsdale for camp and camp for a joyride and i could list other abrupt changes in your disposition you must be careful there are things that should never be given up you must persevere you should try to be a little nicer to me lolita you should also watch your diet the tour of your thigh you know  should not exceed seventeen and a half inches more might be fatal i was kidding of course we are now setting out on a long happy journey  i remember—”  i remember as a child in europe gloating over a map of north america that had “appalachi an mountains” boldly running from alabama up to new brunswick so that the whole region they spanned—t ennessee the virginias pennsylvania new york vermont new hampshire and maine appeared to my imagination as a gigantic switzerland or even tibet all mountain glorious diamond peak upon peak giant conifers le montagnar d émigré in his bear skin glory  and felis tigris goldsmithi  and red indians under the catalpas that it all boiled down to a measly suburban lawn and a smoking garbage incinerator  was appalling farewell appalach ia leaving it we crossed ohio the three states beginning with “i” and nebraska—ah that first whiff of the west we travelled very leisurely  having more than a week to reach wace continental divide where she passionately desired to see the ceremonial dances marking the seasonal opening of magic cave and at least three weeks to reach elphinstone gem of a western state where she yearned to climb red rock from which a mature screen star had recently jumped to her death after a drunken row with her gigolo again we were welcomed to wary motels by means of inscriptions that read “we wish you to feel at home while here all equipm ent was carefully checked upon your arrival your license number is on record here use hot water sparingly  we reserve the right to eject without notice any objectionable person do not throw waste material of any kind in the toilet bowl thank you call again the management ps we conside r our guests the finest people of the w orld” in these frightening places we paid ten for twins flies queued outside at the screenless door and successfully scrambled in the ashes of our predecessors still lingered in the ashtrays a woman’ s hair lay on the pillow  one heard one’s neighbor hanging his coat in his closet the hangers were ingeniously fixed to their bars by coils of wire so as to thwart theft and in crowning insult  the pictures above the twin beds were identical twins i also noticed that commercial fashion was changing there was a tendencyfor cabins to fuse and gradually form the caravansary  and lo she was not interested but the reader may be a second story was added and a lobby grew in and cars were removed to a communal garage and the motel reverted to the good old hotel i now warn the reader not to mock me and my mental daze it is easy for him and me to decipher now a past destiny but a destiny in the making is believe me not one of those honest mystery stories where all you have to do is keep an eye on the clues in my youth i once read a french detective tale where the clues were actual ly in italics but that is not mcfate’ s way— even if one does learn to recognize certain obscure indications for insta nce i would not swear that there was not at least one occasion prior to or at the very beginning of the midwest lap of our journey  when she managed to convey some information to or otherwise get into contact with a person or persons unknown we had stopped at a gas station under the sign of pegasus and she had slipped out of her seat and escaped to the rear of the prem ises while the raised hood under which i had bent to watch the mechanic’ s manipulations hid her for a moment from my sight being inclined to be lenient i only shook my benign head though strictly speaking such visits were taboo since i felt instinctively that toilets—as also telephones—happened to be for reasons unfathomable the points where my desti ny was liable to catch we all have such fateful objects —it may be a recurrent landscape in one case a number in another—carefully chosen by the gods to attract events of special significance for us here shall john always stumble there shall jane’ s heart always break well—my car had been attende d to and i had moved it away from the pumps to let a pickup truck be serviced—when the growing volume of her absence began to weigh upon me in the windy grayness not for the first time and not for the last had i stared in such dull discomfort of mind at those stationary trivialities that look almost surprised like staring rustics to find themselves in the stranded traveller ’s field of vision that green garbage can those very black very whitewalled tires for sale those bright cans of motor oil that red icebox with assorted drinks the four five seven discarded bottles within the incompleted crossword puzzle of their wooden cells that bug patiently walking up the inside of the window of the office radio music was coming from its open door and because the rhythm was not synchronized with the heave and flutter and other gestures of wind animated vegeta tion one had the impression of an old scenic film living itsown life while piano or fiddle followed a line of music quite outside the shivering flower  the swaying branch the sound of charlotte’ s last sob incongruously vibrated through me as with her dress fluttering athwart the rhythm lolita veered from a totally unexpected direction she had found the toilet occupied and had crossed over to the sign of the conche in the next block they said there they were proud of their homeclean restrooms these prepaid postcards they said had been provided for your comments no postcards no soap nothing no comments that day or the next after a tedious drive through a land of food crops we reach ed a pleasant little burg and put up at chestnut court—nice cabins damp green grounds apple trees an old swing—and a tremendous sunset which the tired child ignored she had wanted to go through kasbeam because it was only thirty miles north from her home town but on the following morning i found her quite listless with no desire to see again the sidewalk where she had played hopscotch some five years before for obvious reasons i had rather dreaded that side trip even though we had agreed not to make ourselves conspicuous in any way—to rema in in the car and not look up old friends my relief at her abandoning the project was spoiled by the thought that had she felt i were totally against the nostalgic possibilities of pisky  as i had been last year she would not have given up so easily  on my mentioning this with a sigh she sighed too and complained of being out of sorts  she wanted to remain in bed till teatime at least with lots of magazines and then if she felt better she suggested we just continue westward i must say she was very sweet and languid and craved for fresh fruits and i decided to go and fetch her a toothsome picnic lunch in kasbea m our cabin stood on the timbered crest of a hill and from our window you could see the road winding down and then running as straight as a hair parting between two rows of chestnut trees towards the pretty town which looked singularly distinct and toylike in the pure morning distance one could make out an elflike girl on an insectlike bicycle and a dog a bit too large proportionately  all as clear as those pilgrims and mules winding up waxpale roads in old paintings with blue hills and red little people i have the european urge to use my feet when a drive can be dispensed with so i leisurely walked down eventually meeting the cyclist—a plain plump girl with pigtails followed by a huge st bernard dog with orbits like pansies in kasbeam a very old barber gave me a very mediocre haircut he babbled of a baseballplaying son of his and at everyexplodent spat into my neck and every now and then wiped his glasses on my sheetwrap or interrupted his tremulous scissor work to produce faded newspaper clipp ings and so inattentive was i that it came as a shock to realize as he pointed to an easeled photograph among the ancient gray lotions that the mustached young ball player had been dead for the last thirty years i had a cup of hot flavorless coffee bought a bunch of banana s for my monkey  and spent another ten minutes or so in a delicatessen store at least an hour and a half must have elapsed when this homewardbound little pilgrim appeared on the winding road leading to chestnut castle the girl i had seen on my way to town was now loaded with linen and engaged in helping a misshapen man whose big head and coarse features reminded me of the “bertoldo” character in low italian comedy  they were cleaning the cabins of which there was a dozen or so on chestnut crest all pleasantly space d amid the copio us verdure it was noon and most of them with a final bang of their screen doors had already got rid of their occupants a very elderly  almo st mummylike couple in a very new model were in the act of creeping out of one of the contiguous garages from another a red hood protruded in somewhat codpiece fashion and nearer to our cabin a strong and handsom e young man with a shock of black hair and blue eyes was putting a portable refrigerator into a station wagon for some reason he gave me a sheepish grin as i passed on the grass expanse opposite in the manylimbed shade of luxuriant trees the familiar st bernard dog was guarding his mistress’ bicycle and nearby a young woman far gone in the family way had seated a rapt baby on a swing and was rocking it gently  while a jealous boy of two or three was making a nuisance of himself by trying to push or pull the swin g board he finally succeeded in getting himself knocked down by it and bawled loudly as he lay supin e on the grass while his mother continued to smile gently at neither of her present children i recall so clearly these minutiae probably because i was to check my impressions so thoroughly only a few minutes later and besides something in me had been on guard ever since that awful night in beardsley  i now refused to be diverted by the feeling of wellbe ing that my walk had engendered—by the young summer breeze that enveloped the nape of my neck the giving crunch of the damp gravel the juicy tidbit i had sucked out at last from a hollow tooth and even the comfortable weight of my provisions which the general condition of my heart should not haveallowed me to carry but even that miserable pump of mine seemed to be working sweetly  and i felt adolori d’amour euse langueur  to quote dear old ronsard as i reached the cottage where i had left my dolores to my surprise i found her dressed she was sitting on the edge of the bed in slacks and tshirt and was looking at me as if she could not quite place me the frank soft shape of her small breasts was brough t out rather than blurred by the limpness of her thin shirt and this frankn ess irritated me she had not washed yet her mouth was freshly thoug h smudgily painted and her broad teeth glistened like winetinged ivory  or pinkish poker chips and there she sat hands clasped in her lap and dreamily brimmed with a diabolical glow that had no relation to me whatever  i plumped down my heavy paper bag and stood staring at the bare ankles of her sandaled feet then at her silly face then again at her sinful feet “you’ve been out” i said the sandals were filthy with gravel “i just got up” she replied and added upon intercepting my downward glance “w ent out for a sec w anted to see if you were coming back” she became aware of the bananas and uncoiled herself tableward what special suspicion could i have none indeed—but those muddy  moony eyes of hers that singular warmth emanating from her i said nothing i looked at the road meandering so distinctly within the frame of the window … anybody wishin g to betray my trust would have found it a splendid lookou t with rising appetite lo applied herself to the fruit all at once i remembered the ingratia ting grin of the johnny nextdoor  i stepped out quickly  all cars had disappeared except his station wagon his pregnant young wife was now getting into it with her baby and the other  more or less cancelled child “what’ s the matter  where are you going” cried lo from the porch i said nothing i pushed her softness back into the room and went in after her i ripped her shirt off i unzipped the rest of her i tore off her sandals wildly i pursued the shadow of her infidelity but the scent i travelled upon was so slight as to be practically undistinguishable from a madman’ s fancy   gr os gaston in his prissy way had liked to make presents—presents just a prissy wee bit out of the ordina ry or so he prissily thought noticing one night that my box of chessmen was broken he sent me next morning with a little lad of his a copper case it had an elaborate oriental design over the lid and could be securely locked one glance sufficed to assure me that it was one of those cheap money boxes called for some reason “luizettas” that you buy in algiers and elsewhere and wonder what to do with afterwards it turned out to be much too flat for holding my bulky chessmen  but i kept it—using it for a totally dif ferent purpose in order to break some pattern of fate in which i obscurely felt myself being enmeshed i had decided—despite lo’s visible annoyance—to spend another night at chestnut court definitely waking up at four in the morning i ascertained that lo was still sound asleep mouth open in a kind of dull amazement at the curiously inane life we all had rigged up for her and satisfied myself that the precious contents of the “luizetta” were safe there snugly wrapped in a white woollen scarf lay a pocket automatic caliber  capacity of magazine  cartridges length a little under one ninth of lolita’ s length stock checked walnut finish full blued i had inherited it from the late harold haze with a  catalog which cheerily said in part “particularly well adapted for use in the home and car as well as on the person” there it lay ready for instant service on the person or persons loaded and fully cocked with the slide lock in safety position thus precluding any accidental dischar ge we must remember that a pistol is the freudian symbol of the ur father ’s central forelimb i was now glad i had it with me—and even more glad that i had learned to use it two years before in the pine forest around my and charlotte’ s glass lake farlow  with whom i had roamed those remote woods was an admirable marksman and with his  actually managed to hit a hummingbird though i must say not much of it could be retriev ed for proof —only a little iridescent fluff a burley expoliceman called krestovski who in the twen ties had shot and killed two escaped convicts joined us andbagged a tiny woodpecker—completely out of season incidentally  between those two sportsmen i of course was a novice and kept missing everything though i did wound a squirrel on a later occasion when i went out alone “you lie here” i whispered to my lightweight compact little chum and then toasted it with a dram of gin  the reader must now forget chestnuts and colts and accompany us further west the following days were marked by a number of great thunderstorms —or perhaps there was but one single storm which progressed across country in ponderous frogleaps and which we could not shake off just as we could not shake off detective trapp for it was during those days that the problem of the aztec red convertible presented itself to me and quite overshadowed the theme of lo’ s lovers queer i who was jealous of every male we met—queer  how i misinterpreted the designations of doom perhaps i had been lulled by lo’s modest behavior in winter  and anyway it would have been too foolish even for a lunatic to suppose another humbert was avidly following humbert and humbert’ s nymphet with jovian firework s over the great and ugly plains i surmised donc  that the red yak keeping behind us at a discreet distance mile after mile was operated by a detective whom some busybody had hired to see what exactly humbert humbert was doing with that minor stepdaughter of his as happens with me at periods of electrical disturbance and crepitating lightnings i had hallucinations maybe they were more than hallucinations i do not know what she or he or both had put into my liquor but one night i felt sure somebody was tapping on the door of our cabin and i flung it open and noticed two things—that i was stark naked and that whiteglistening in the raindripping darkness there stood a man holding before his face the mask of jutting chin a grotesque sleuth in the funnies he emitted a muffled guffaw and scurried away  and i reeled back into the room and fell asleep again and am not sure even to this day that the visit was not a drugp rovoked dream  i have thoroughly studied trapp’s type of humor  and this might have been a plausible sample oh crude and absolutely ruthless somebody  i imagined was making money on those masks of popular monsters and morons did i see next morning two urchins rummaging in a garbage can and trying on jutting chin i wonder it may all have been a coincidence—due to atmospheric conditions i supposebeing a murderer with a sensational but incomplete and unorthodox memory  i cannot tell you ladies and gentlemen the exact day when i first knew with utter certainty that the red convertible was following us i do remember  however the first time i saw its driver quite clearly  i was proceeding slowly one afternoo n through torrents of rain and kept seeing that red ghost swimming and shivering with lust in my mirror when presently the deluge dwindled to a patter and then was suspended altogether  with a swishing sound a sunburst swept the highway  and needing a pair of new sunglasses i pulled up at a filling station  what was happening was a sickness a cancer that could not be helped so i simply ignored the fact that our quiet pursuer  in his converted state stopped a little behind us at a café or bar bearin g the idiotic sign the bustle a deceitful seatful having seen to the needs of my car i walked into the office to get those glasses and pay for the gas as i was in the act of signing a traveller ’s check and wondered about my exact whereabouts i happened to glance through a side window  and saw a terrible thing a broadbacked man baldish in an oatmeal coat and darkbrown trousers was listening to lo who was leanin g out of the car and talking to him very rapidly  her hand with outspread fingers going up and down as it did when she was very serious and emphatic what struck me with sickening force was—how should i put it—the voluble familiarity of her way as if they had known each other—oh for weeks and weeks i saw him scratch his cheek and nod and turn and walk back to his convertible a broad and thickish man of my age somewhat resembling gustave trapp a cousin of my father ’s in switzerland—same smoothly tanned face fuller than mine with a small dark mustache and a rosebud degenerate mouth lolita was studying a road map when i got back into the car  “what did that man ask you lo” “man oh that man oh yes oh i don’t know  he wondered if i had a map lost his way  i guess” we drove on and i said “now listen lo i do not know whether you are lying or not and i do not know whether you are insane or not and i do not care for the moment but that person has been following us all day and his car was at the motel yesterday  and i think he is a cop you know perfectly well what will happen and where you will go if the police find out about things now i want to know exactly what he said to you and what you told him”she laughed “if he’s really a cop” she said shrilly but not illogically  “the worst thing we could do would be to show him we are scared ignore him dad” “did he ask where we were going” “oh he knows that” mocking me “anyway ” i said giving up “i have seen his face now he is not pretty  he looks exactly like a relative of mine called t rapp” “perhaps he is trapp if i were you—oh look all the nines are changing into the next thousand when i was a little kid” she continued unexpectedly  “i used to think they’d stop and go back to nines if only my mother agreed to put the car in reverse” it was the first time i think she spoke spontaneously of her pre humbertian childhood perhaps the theatre had taught her that trick and silently we travelled on unpursued but next day like pain in a fatal disease that comes back as the drug and hope wear off there it was again behind us that glossy red beast the traffic on the highway was light that day nobody passed anybody and nobody attempte d to get in between our humble blue car and its imperious red shadow—as if there were some spell cast on that interspace a zone of evil mirth and magic a zone whose very precision and stability had a glass like virtue that was almost artistic the driver behind me with his stuffed shoulders and trappish mustac he looked like a display dumm y and his convertible seemed to move only because an invisible rope of silent silk connected it with our shabby vehicle we were many times weaker than his splendid lacque red machine so that i did not even attempt to outspeed him o lente currite noctis equi o softly run nightmares we climbed long grades and rolled downhill again  and heeded speed limits and spared slow children and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves on their yellow shields and no matter how and where we drove the enchanted interspace slid on intact mathematical miragelike the viatic counterpart of a magic carpet and all the time i was aware of a private blaze on my right her joyful eye her flaming cheek a traffic policeman deep in the nightmare of crisscross streets—at half pastfour pm in a factory town—was the hand of chance that interrupted the spell he beckoned me on and then with the same hand cut off my shadow  a score of cars were launched in between us and i sped on and deftlyturned into a narrow lane a sparrow alighted with a jumbo bread crumb was tackled by another  and lost the crumb when after a few grim stoppages and a bit of deliberate meandering i returned to the highway  our shadow had disappeared lola snorted and said “if he is what you think he is how silly to give him the slip” “i have other notions by now ” i said “you should—ah—check them by—ah—keeping in touch with him fahther deah” said lo writhing in the coils of her own sarcasm “gee you are mean” she added in her ordinary voice we spent a grim night in a very foul cabin under a sonorous amplitude of rain and with a kind of prehi storically loud thunder incessa ntly rolling above us “i am not a lady and do not like lightning” said lo whose dread of electric storms gave me some pathetic solace we had breakfast in the township of soda pop  “judging by the terminal figure” i remarked “fatface is already here” “your humor ” said lo “is sidesplitting deah fahther ” we were in sagebrush country by that time and there was a day or two of lovely release i had been a fool all was well that discomfort was merely a trapped flatus and presently the mesas gave way to real mountains and on time we drove into w ace oh disaster  some confusion had occurred she had misread a date in the tour book and the magic cave ceremonies were over she took it bravely  i must admit— and when we discovered there was in kurortish wace a summer theatre in full swing we naturally drifted toward it one fair mid june evening i really could not tell you the plot of the play we saw a trivial affair no doubt with selfconscious light effects and a mediocre leading lady the only detail that pleased me was a garland of seven little graces more or less immobile prettily painted barelim bed—seven bemused pubesc ent girls in colored gauze that had been recru ited locally judging by the partisan flurry here and there among the audience and were supposed to represent a living rainbow  which lingered throughout the last act and rather teasingly faded behind a series of multipl ied veils i remember think ing that this idea of childrencolors had been lifted by authors clare quilty and vivian darkbloom from a passage in james joyce and that two of the colors were quite exasperatingly lovely— orange whokept fidgeting all the time and emerald who when her eyes got used to the pitchblack pit where we all heavily sat suddenly smiled at her mother or her protector  as soon as the thing was over and manual applause—a sound my nerves cannot stand—b egan to crash all around me i started to pull and push lo toward the exit in my so natura l amorous impatience to get her back to our neonblue cottage in the stunned starry night i always say nature is stunned by the sights she sees dollylo however  lagged behin d in a rosy daze her please d eyes narrowed her sense of vision swamping the rest of her senses to such an extent that her limp hands hardly came together at all in the mechanical action of clapping they still went through i had seen that kind of thing in children before but by god this was a special child myopically beaming at the already remote stage where i glimpsed something of the joint authors—a man’ s tuxedo and the bare shoulders of a hawklike blackhaired strikingly tall woman “you’ve again hurt my wrist you brute” said lolita in a small voice as she slipped into her car seat “i am dreadfully sorry  my darling my own ultraviolet darling” i said unsuccessfully trying to catch her elbow  and i added to change the conversation—to change the direction of fate oh god oh god “vivian is quite a woman i am sure we saw her yesterday in that restaur ant in soda pop” “sometimes” said lo “you are quite revoltingly dumb first vivian is the male author  the gal author is clare and second she is forty married and has negro blood” “i thoug ht” i said kidding her “quilty was an ancient flame of yours in the days when you loved me in sweet old ramsdale” “what” counte red lo her featu res working “that fat dentist you must be confusing me with some other fast little article” and i thought to myself how those fast little articles forget everything everything while we old lovers treasure every inch of their nymphancy   with lo’s knowledge and assent the two post offices given to the beardsley postm aster as forwarding addresses were

have often wondered why she did not go for ever that day was it the retentive quality of her new summer clothes in my locked car was it some unripe particle in some general plan was it simply because all things considered i might as well be used to convey her to elphinstone —the secret terminus anyway i only know i was quite certain she had left me for ever the noncommittal mauve mountains half

east side i went back to fashions and auto parts i told myself with a burst of furious sarcasm— un ricanement —that i was crazy to suspect her  that she would turn up in a minute she did i wheeled around and shook off the hand she had placed on my sleeve with a timid and imbecile smile “get into the car ” i said she obey ed and i went on pacing up and down struggling with nameless thoughts trying to plan some way of tackling her duplicity  presently she left the car and was at my side again my sense of hearing gradually got tuned in to statio n lo again and i became aware she was telling me that she had met a former girl friend “yes whom” “a beardsley girl” “good i know every name in your group alice adams” “this girl was not in my group” “good i have a complete student list with me her name please” “she was not in my school she is just a town girl in beardsley ” “good i have the beardsley directory with me too we’ll look up all the browns” “i only know her first name”

stature and smirking pose suggested that when clothed it had represented and would represent when clothed again a girlchild of lolita’ s size but in its present state it was sexless next to it stood a much taller veiled bride quite perfect and intacta except for the lack of one arm on the floor  at the feet of these damsels where the man crawled about laboriously with his cleaner  there lay a cluster of three slender arms and a blond wig two of the arms happened to be twisted and seemed to suggest a clasping gesture of horror and supplication “look lo” i said quietly  “look well is not that a rather good symbol of some thing or other however”—i went on as we got back in to the car —“i have taken certain precautions here delicately opening the glove compartment on this pad i have our boy friend’ s car number ” as the ass i was i had not memorized it what remained of it in my mind were the initial letter and the closing figure as if the whole amphitheatre of six signs recede d concavely behind a tinted glass too opaque to allow the central series to be deciphered but just translucent enough to make out its extreme edges—a capital p and a  i have to go into those details which in themselves can interest only a professional psychologue because otherwise the reader ah if i could visualize him as a blond bearded scholar with rosy lips sucking la pomme de sa canne as he quaffs my manuscript might not understand the quality of the shock i experienced upon noticin g that the p had acqu ired the bustle of a b and that the  had been deleted altogether the rest with erasures revealing the hurried shuttle smear of a pencil’ s rubber end and with parts of numbers obliterated or reconst ructed in a child’ s hand presented a tangle of barbed wire to any logical interpretation all i knew was the state—one adjacent to the state beardsley was in i said nothing i put the pad back closed the compartment and drove out of wace lo had grabbed some comics from the back seat and mobile whitebloused one brown elbow out of the window  was deep in the current adventure of some clout or clown three or four miles out of wace i turned into the shadow of a picnic ground where the morning had dumped its litter of light on an empty table lo looked up with a semismile of surprise and without a word i delivered a tremendous backhand cut that caught her smack on her hot hard little cheekbone and then the remorse the poignant sweetness of sobbing atonement groveling love the hopelessne ss of sensual reconciliation in the velvet night at mirana motel mirana i kissed the yellowish soles of her long toed feet i immolated myself … but it was all of no avail both doomed were we and soon i was to enter a new cycle of persecution in a street of wace on its outskirts … oh i am quite sure it was not a delusion in a street of wace i had glimpsed the aztec red convertible or its ident ical twin instead of trapp it contained four or five loud young people of several sexes—but i said nothing after wace a totally new situation arose for a day or two i enjoyed the mental emphasis with which i told myself that we were not and never had been followed and then i became sickenin gly conscious that trapp had changed his tactics and was still with us in this or that rented car  a veritable proteus of the highway  with bewildering ease he switched from one vehicle to another  this technique implied the existence of garages specializing in “stageautomobile” operations but i never could discover the remises he used he seemed to patronize at first the chevrolet genus beginnin g with a camp us cream convertible then going on to a small horizon blue sedan and thenceforth fading into surf gray and driftwood gray  then he turned to other makes and passed through a pale dull rainbow of paint shades and one day i found myself attempting to cope with the subtle distinction between our own dream blue melmoth and the crest blue olds mobile he had rented grays however  remained his favorite cryptochromism and in agonizing nightmares i tried in vain to sort outproperly such ghosts as chrysler ’s shell gray  chevrolet’ s thistle gray  dodge’ s french gray … the necessity of being constant ly on the lookout for his little moustache and open shirt— or for his baldish pate and broad shoulders—led me to a profound study of all cars on the road—behind before alongsi de coming going every vehicle under the dancing sun the quiet vacationist’ s automobile with the box of tender touch tissues in the back window the recklessly speeding jalopy full of pale children with a shaggy dog’s head protruding and a crumpled mudguard the bachelor ’s tudor sedan crowded with suits on hangers the huge fat house trailer weaving in front immune to the indian file of fury boilin g behind it the car with the young female passenger politely perched in the middle of the front seat to be closer to the young male driver the car carry ing on its roof a red boat bottom up … the gray car slowing up before us the gray car catching up with us we were in mountain country  somewhere between snow and champion and rolling down an almost imperceptible grade when i had my next distinct view of detective paramour trapp the gray mist behind us had deepened and concentrated into the compactness of a dominion blue sedan all of a sudden as if the car i drove responded to my poor heart’ s pangs we were slithering from side to side with something making a helpless plapplapplap under us “you got a flat mister ” said cheerful lo i pulled up—near a precipice she folded her arms and put her foot on the dashboard i got out and examined the right rear wheel the base of its tire was sheepishly and hideously square trapp had stopped some fifty yards behind us his distant face formed a grease spot of mirth this was my chance i started to walk towards him—with the brilliant idea of asking him for a jack though i had one he backed a little i stubbed my toe against a stone—and there was a sense of general laughter  then a tremendous truck loomed from behind trapp and thundered by me—and immediately after i heard it utter a convulsive honk  instinctively i looked back—and saw my own car gently creeping away  i could make out lo ludicrously at the wheel and the engine was certainly running—though i remembered i had cut it but had not applied the emer gency brake and during the brief space of throbtime that it took me to reach the croaking machine which came to a standstill at last it dawned upon me that during the last two years little lo had had ample time to pick up the rudiments of driving as i wrenched thedoor open i was goddam sure she had started the car to prevent me from walking up to trapp her trick proved useless however  for even while i was pursuing her he had made an energetic uturn and was gone i rested for a while lo asked wasn’ t i going to thank her—the car had started to move by itself and—getting no answer  she immersed herself in a study of the map i got out again and commenced the “ordeal of the orb” as charlotte used to say  perhaps i was losing my mind we continued our grotesque journey  after a forlorn and useless dip we went up and up on a steep grade i found myself behind the gigantic truck that had overtaken us it was now groaning up a winding road and was impossible to pass out of its front part a small oblong of smooth silver— the inner wrapping of chewin g gum—escaped and flew back into our windshield it occurred to me that if i were really losing my mind i might end by murdering somebody  in fact—said highanddry humbert to floundering humbert—it might be quite clever to prepare things—to transfer the weapon from box to pocket—so as to be ready to take advantage of the spell of insanity when it does come  by permitting lolita to study acting i had fond fool suffered her to cultivate deceit it now appeared that it had not been merely a matter of learning the answers to such questions as what is the basic conflict in “hedda gabler ” or where are the climaxes in “love under the lindens” or analyze the prevailing mood of “cherry orchard” it was really a matter of learning to betray me how i deplored now the exercises in sensual simulation that i had so often seen her go through in our beardsley parlo r when i would observe her from some strategic point while she like a hypnotic subject or a performer in a mystic rite produced sophisticated versions of infantile makebelie ve by going through the mimeti c actions of hearing a moan in the dark seeing for the first time a brand new young stepmother  tasting something she hated such as buttermilk smelling crushed grass in a lush orchard or touching mirages of objects with her sly slender  girlchi ld hands among my papers i still have a mimeographed sheet suggesting tactile drill imagine yourself picking up and holding a pingpong ball an apple a sticky date a new flannelfluf fed tennis ball a hot potato an ice cube a kitten a puppy  a horseshoe a feather a flashlight knead with your fingers the following imaginary things a piece of bread india rubber  a friend’ s aching temple a sample of velvet a rose petal you are a blind girl palpate the face of a greek youth cyrano santa claus a baby  a laughing faun a sleeping stranger  your father  but she had been so pretty in the weaving of those delicate spells in the dreamy performance of her enchantments and duties on certain adventurous evenings in beardsley  i also had her dance for me with the promise of some treat or gift and although these routine legparted leaps of hers were more like those of a football cheerleader than like the languorous and jerky motion s of a parisian petit rat  the rhythms of her not quite nubilelimbs had given me pleasure but all that was nothing absolut ely nothing to the indescribable itch of rapture that her tennis game produced in me— the teasing delirious feeling of teetering on the very brink of unearthly order and splendor  despite her advanced age she was more of a nymphet than ever with her apricotcolored limbs in her subteen tennis togs winged gentlemen no hereafter is acceptable if it does not produce her as she was then in that colorado resort between snow and elphinstone with everything right the white wide littleboy shorts the slender waist the apricot midrif f the white breastkerchief whose ribbons went up and encircled her neck to end behind in a dangling knot leaving bare her gaspingly young and adorable apricot shoulder blades with that pubesc ence and those lovely gentle bones and the smooth downwa rdtapering back her cap had a white peak her racket had cost me a small fortune idiot triple idiot i could have filmed her i would have had her now with me before my eyes in the projection room of my pain and despair she would wait and relax for a bar or two of whitelined time before going into the act of serving and often bounced the ball once or twice or pawed the ground a little alwa ys at ease always rather vagu e about the score always cheerful as she so seldom was in the dark life she led at home her tennis was the highest point to which i can imagine a young creature bringing the art of makebelieve  although i daresay  for her it was the very geometry of basic reality  the exquisite clarity of all her movements had its auditory coun terpart in the pure ringing sound of her every stroke the ball when it entered her aura of contr ol became somehow whiter  its resilience somehow richer  and the instrument of precision she used upon it seemed inordinately prehensile and deliberate at the moment of clinging contact her form was indeed an absolutely perfect imitation of absolutely topnotch tennis—without any utilitarian results as edusa’ s sister  electra gold a marvelous young coach said to me once while i sat on a pulsating hard benc h watching dolores haze toying with linda hall and being beaten by her “dolly has a magnet in the center of her racket guts but why the heck is she so polite” ah electra what did it matter  with such grace i remember at the very first game i watche d being drenched with an almost painful convulsion of beauty assimilat ion my lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and sprin gy start of the service cycle when there would develop andhang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot pristine armpit burnished arm and far backflung racket as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the smal l globe suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip it had that serve of hers beaut y directness youth a classical purity of trajectory  and was despite its spanking pace fairly easy to return having as it did no twist or sting to its long elegant hop that i could have had all her strokes all her enchantments immortalized in segm ents of celluloid makes me moan today with frustration they would have been so much more than the snapshots i burned her overhead volley was related to her service as the envoy is to the ballade for she had been trained my pet to patter up at once to the net on her nimble vivid whiteshod feet there was nothing to choose between her forehand and backhand drives they were mirror images of one another—my very loins still tingle with those pistol reports repeated by crisp echoes and electra’ s cries one of the pearls of dolly’ s game was a short halfvoll ey that ned litam had taught her in california she preferred acting to swimming and swimming to tennis yet i insist that had not something within her been broken by me—not that i realized it then—she would have had on the top of her perfect form the will to win and would have become a real girl champion dolores with two rackets under her arm in wimbledon dolores endorsing a dromedary  dolores turning professi onal dolores acting a girl champion in a movie dolores and her gray  humble hushed husbandcoach old humbert there was nothing wrong or deceitful in the spirit of her game—unless one considered her cheerful indifference toward its outcome as the feint of a nymphet she who was so cruel and crafty in everyday life revealed an innocence a frankness a kindness of ballplacing that permitted a second rate but determined player  no matter how uncouth and incompetent to poke and cut his way to victory  despite her small stature she covered the one thousand and fiftythree square feet of her half of the court with wonderful ease once she had entered into the rhythm of a rally and as long as she could direct that rhythm but any abrupt attack or sudden change of tactics on her adversary’ s part left her helpless at match point her second serve which—rather typically—was even stronger and more stylish than her first for she had none of the inhibitions that cautious winners havewould strike vibrantly the harp cord of the net—and ricochet out of court the polished gem of her drops hot was snapped up and put away by an opponent who seemed fourlegged and wielded a crooked paddle her dramatic drives and lovely volle ys would candidly fall at his feet over and over again she would land an easy one into the net—and merrily mimic dismay by drooping in a ballet attitude with her forelocks hanging so sterile were her grace and whipp er that she could not even win from panting me and my oldfashioned lifting drive i suppose i am especially susceptible to the magic of games in my chess sessions with gaston i saw the board as a square pool of limpid water with rare shells and stratagems rosily visible upon the smooth tessellated bottom which to my confused adversary was all ooze and squidcloud similarly  the initial tennis coaching i had inflicted on lolita—prior to the revelations that came to her through the great californian’ s lessons—rema ined in my mind as oppressive and distressful memories—not only because she had been so hopelessly and irritating ly irritated by every suggestion of mine— but because the precious symmetry of the court instead of reflecting the harmonies latent in her was utterly jumbled by the clumsiness and lassitude of the resentful child i mistaught now things were different and on that particular day in the pure air of champion colorado on that admirable court at the foot of steep stone stairs leading up to champion hotel where we had spent the night i felt i could rest from the nightmare of unknown betrayals within the innocence of her style of her soul of her essential grace she was hitting hard and flat with her usual effortless sweep feeding me deep skimming balls—all so rhythmically coordinated and overt as to reduce my footwork to practic ally a swinging stroll—crack players will understand what i mean my rather heavily cut serve that i had been taught by my father who had learned it from decugis or borman old friends of his and great champions would have seriously troubled my lo had i really tried to trouble her but who would upset such a lucid dear did i ever mention that her bare arm bore the  of vaccination that i loved her hopelessly that she was only fourteen an inquisitive butterfly passed dipping between us two people in tennis shorts a redhaired fellow only about eight years my junio r with sunburnt bright pink shins and an indolent dark girl with a moody mouth and hard eyes about two years lolita’ s senior  appeared fromnowhere as is common with dutiful tyros their rackets were sheathed and framed and they carried them not as if they were the natural and comfortable extensions of certain specialized muscles but hammers or blunderbusses or wimbles or my own dreadful cumbersome sins rather unceremoniously seating themselves near my precious coat on a bench adjacent to the court they fell to admiring very vocally a rally of some fifty exchanges that lo innocently helped me to foster and uphold—until there occurred a syncope in the series causing her to gasp as her overhead smash went out of court whereupon she melted into winsome merriment my golden pet i felt thirsty by then and walked to the drinking fountain there red approached me and in all humility suggested a mixed double “i am bill mead” he said “and that’s fay page actress maffy on say”— he added pointing with his ridiculously hooded racket at polished fay who was already talking to dolly i was about to reply “sorry  but—” for i hate to have my filly involved in the chops and jabs of cheap bungle rs when a remarkably melodious cry diverted my attention a bellboy was tripping down the steps from the hotel to our court and making me signs i was wanted if you please on an urgent long distance call—so urgent in fact that the line was being held for me certainly  i got into my coat inside pocket heavy with pistol and told lo i would be back in a minut e she was picking up a ball—in the continental footracket way which was one of the few nice things i had taught her —and smiled—she smiled at me an awful calm kept my heart afloat as i followed the boy up to the hotel this to use an american term in which discovery  retribution torture death eternity appear in the shape of a singularly repulsive nutshell was it i had left her in mediocre hands but it hardly mattered now i would fight of course oh i would fight better destroy everything than surrender her yes quite a climb at the desk a dignified rom annosed man with i suggest a very obscure past that might reward investigation handed me a message in his own hand the line had not been held after all the note said “mr humbert the head of birdsley sic school called summer residence—birdsley  please call back immediately  highly important” i folded myself into a booth took a little pill and for about twenty minutes tussled with spacespooks a quartet of propositions graduallybecame audible  soprano there was no such number in bear dsley alto miss pratt was on her way to england tenor  beardsley school had not telephoned bass they could not have done so since nobody knew i was that particular day in champion colo upon my stinging him the roman took the trouble to find out if there had been a long distance call there had been none a fake call from some local dial was not excluded i thanked him he said you bet after a visit to the purling men’ s room and a stiff drink at the bar i started on my return march from the very first terrace i saw far below  on the tennis court which seemed the size of a school child’ s illwiped slate golden lolita playing in a double she moved like a fair angel among three horrible boschian cripples one of these her partner  while changing sides jocosely slapped her on her behind with his racket he had a remar kably round head and wore incongruous brown trousers there was a momentary flurry—he saw me and throwing away his racket —mine—scuttled up the slope he waved his wrists and elbow s in would be comical imitation of rudimen tary wings as he climbed bowlegged to the street where his gray car awaited him next moment he and the grayness were gone when i came down the remaining trio were collecting and sorting out the balls “mr mead who was that person” bill and fay both looking very solemn shook their heads that absurd intruder had butted in to make up a double hadn’ t he dolly dolly  the handle of my racket was still disgustingly warm before returning to the hotel i ushered her into a little alley halfsmothered in fragrant shrubs with flowers like smoke and was about to burst into ripe sobs and plead with her imperturbed dream in the most abject manner for clarification no matter how meretricious of the slow awfulness enveloping me when we found ourselves behind the convulsed mead twosome— assorted people you know  meeting among idyllic settings in old comedies bill and fay were both weak with laughter—we had come at the end of their private joke it did not really matter  speaking as if it really did not really matter  and assuming apparently  that life was automatically rolling on with all its routine pleasures lolita said she would like to change into her bathing things and spend the rest of the afternoon at the swimming pool it was a gor geous day  lolita  “lo lola lolita” i hear myself crying from a doorway into the sun with the acoustics of time domed time endowing my call and its telltale hoarseness with such a wealth of anxiety  passion and pain that really it would have been instrumental in wrenching open the zipper of her nylon shroud had she been dead lolita in the middle of a trim turfed terrace i found her at last—she had run out before i was ready  oh lolita there she was playing with a damned dog not me the animal a terrier of sorts was losing and snapp ing up again and adjusting between his jaws a wet little red ball he took rapid chords with his front paws on the resilient turf and then would bounce away  i had only wanted to see where she was i could not swim with my heart in that state but who cared—and there she was and there was i in my robe—and so i stopped calling but suddenly something in the pattern of her motions as she dashed this way and that in her aztec red bathing briefs and bra struck me … there was an ecstasy  a madness about her frolics that was too much of a glad thing even the dog seemed puzzled by the extravagance of her reactions i put a gentle hand to my chest as i surveyed the situation the turquoise blue swimming pool some distance behind the lawn was no longer behind that lawn but within my thorax and my organs swam in it like excrements in the blue sea water in nice one of the bathers had left the pool and halfconcealed by the peacocked shade of trees stood quite still holding the ends of the towel around his neck and following lolita with his amber eyes there he stood in the camouflag e of sun and shade disfigured by them and masked by his own nakedness his damp black hair or what was left of it glued to his round head his little mustache a humid smear  the wool on his chest spread like a symmetri cal trophy  his naval pulsating his hirsute thighs dripping with bright droplets his tight wet black bathing trunks bloated and bursting with vigor where his great fat bullybag was pulled up and back like a padded shield over his reversed beasthood and as i looked at his oval nut brown face it dawned upon me that what i had recognized him by was the reflection of my daughter ’s countenance—the same beatitude and grimacebut made hideous by his malene ss and i also knew that the child my child knew he was looking enjoyed the lechery of his look and was putting on a show of gambol and glee the vile and beloved slut as she made for the ball and missed it she fell on her back with her obscene young legs madly pedalling in the air i could sense the musk of her excitement from where i stood and then i saw petrified with a kind of sacred disgust the man close his eyes and bare his small horribly small and even teeth as he leaned against a tree in which a multitude of dappled priaps shivered immediately afterwards a marvelous transfo rmation took place he was no longer the satyr but a very goodnatured and foolish swiss cousin the gustave trapp i have mentioned more than once who used to counteract his “sprees” he drank beer with milk the good swine by feats of weightlifting—tottering and grunting on a lake beach with his otherwise very complete bathing suit jauntily stripped from one shoulder  this trapp noticed me from afar and working the towel on his nape walked back with false insouciance to the pool and as if the sun had gone out of the game lo slackened and slowly got up ignoring the ball that the terrier placed before her who can say what heartbreaks are caused in a dog by our discontinuing a romp i started to say something and then sat down on the grass with a quite monstrous pain in my chest and vomited a torrent of browns and greens that i had never remembered eating i saw lolita’ s eyes and they seemed to be more calculating than frightened i heard her saying to a kind lady that her father was having a fit then for a long time i lay in a lounge chair swallowing pony upon pony of gin and next morning i felt strong enough to drive on which in later years no doctor believed  the tworoom cabin we had ordered at silver spur court elphinstone turned out to belong to the glossily browned pinelog kind that lolita used to be so fond of in the days of our carefree first journey oh how different things were now i am not referring to trapp or trapps after all—well really … after all gentlemen it was becoming abundantly clear that all those identical detectives in prismatically changing cars were figments of my persecution mania recurrent images based on coincidence and chance resemblance soyons logiques  crowed the cocky gallic part of my brain— and proceeded to rout the notion of a lolitamaddened salesman or comedy gangster  with stooges persecuting me and hoaxing me and otherwise taking riotous advantage of my strange relations with the law i remember humming my panic away  i remember evolving even an explanation of the “birdsley” telep hone call … but if i could dismiss trapp as i had dismissed my convulsions on the lawn at champion i could do nothing with the anguish of knowing lolita to be so tantalizingly  so miserably unattainable and beloved on the very eve of a new era when my alembics told me she should stop being a nymphet stop torturing me an additional abominable and perfectly gratuitous worry was lovingly prepared for me in elphinstone lo had been dull and silent during the last lap—two hundred mountainous miles uncontaminated by smokegray sleuths or zigzagging zanies she hardly glanced at the famous oddly shaped splendid ly flushed rock which jutted above the mountains and had been the takeof f for nirvana on the part of a temperamental show girl the town was newly built or rebuilt on the flat floor of a seventhousandfoot high valley it would soon bore lo i hoped and we would spin on to california to the mexican border  to mythical bays saguaro deserts fatamor ganas josé lizzarrabengoa as you remember  planned to take his carmen to the etats unis  i conjured up a central american tennis competition in which dolores haze and various californian schoolgirl champions would dazzlingly participate goodwill tours on that smiling level eliminate the distinction between passport and sport why did i hopewe would be happy abroad a change of environment is the traditional fallacy upon which doomed loves and lungs rely  mrs hays the brisk brickly rouged blueeyed widow who ran the motor court asked me if i were swiss perchance because her sister had married a swiss ski instructor  i was whereas my daughter happened to be half irish i registered hays gave me the key and a twinkling smile and still twinkling showed me where to park the car lo crawled out and shivered a little the luminous evening air was decidedly crisp upon entering the cabin she sat down on a chair at a card table buried her face in the crook of her arm and said she felt awful shamming i thought shamming no doubt to evade my caresses i was passionately parched but she began to whimper in an unusually dreary way when i attempted to fondle her lolita ill lolita dying her skin was scalding hot i took her temperature orally  then looked up a scribbled formula i fortunately had in a jotter and after laboriously reducing the meaningless to me degrees fahrenheit to the intimate centrig rade of my childhood found she had  which at least made sense hysterical little nymphs might i knew  run up all kinds of temperature—even exceeding a fatal count and i would have given her a sip of hot spiced wine and two aspirins and kissed the fever away if upon an examination of her lovely uvula one of the gems of her body  i had not seen that it was a burning red i undressed her her breath was bittersweet her brown rose tasted of blood she was shaking from head to toe she complained of a painful stiffness in the upper vertebrae—and i thought of poliomyelitis as any american parent would giving up all hope of intercourse i wrapped her up in a laprobe and carried her into the car kind mrs hays in the meantime had alerted the local doctor  “you are lucky it happened here” she said for not only was blue the best man in the district but the elphinstone hospital was as modern as modern could be despite its limited capacity  with a heterosexual erlkönig in pursuit thither i drove halfblinded by a royal sunset on the lowland side and guided by a little old woman a portable witch perhaps his daughter  whom mrs hays had lent me and whom i was never to see again dr  blue whose learning no doubt was infinitely inferior to his reputation assured me it was a virus infection and when i alluded to her comparatively recent flu curtly said this was another bug he had forty such cases on his hands all of which sounded like the “ague” of the ancients i wondered if i should mention with a casual chuckle that my fifteenyear old daughter had had a minor accident whileclimbing an awkward fence with her boy friend but knowing i was drunk i decided to withhold the information till later if necessary  to an unsmiling blond bitch of a secretary i gave my daughter ’s age as “practica lly sixteen” while i was not looking my child was taken away from me in vain i insisted i be allowed to spend the night on a “welcome” mat in a corner of their damned hospital i ran up constructivistic flights of stairs i tried to trace my darling so as to tell her she had better not babble especially if she felt as lighthead ed as we all did at one point i was rather dread fully rude to a very young and very cheeky nurse with overdeveloped gluteal parts and blazing black eyes—of basque descent as i learned her father was an imported shephe rd a trainer of sheep dogs finally  i returned to the car and remained in it for i do not know how many hours hunched up in the dark stunned by my new solitude looking out openmouthed now at the dimly illumed very square and low hospital building squatting in the middle of its lawny block now up at the wash of stars and the jagged silvery ramparts of the haute montagne where at the moment mary’ s father  lonely joseph lore was dreaming of oloron lagore rolas— que saisje —or seducing a ewe suchlike fragrant vagabond thoughts have been always a solace to me in times of unusual stress and only when despite liberal libations i felt fairly numbed by the endless night did i think of driving back to the motel the old woman had disappeared and i was not quite sure of my way wide gravel roads crisscrossed drow sy rectangular shadows i made out what looked like the silhouette of gallows on what was probabl y a school playground and in another wastelike block there rose in domed silence the pale temple of some local sect i found the highway at last and then the motel where millions of socalled “millers” a kind of insect were swarming aroun d the neon conto urs of “no vacancy” and when at  am after one of those untimely hot showers which like some mordant only help to fix a man’ s despair and weariness i lay on her bed that smelled of chestnuts and roses and peppe rmint and the very delicate very special french perfume i latterly allow ed her to use i found myself unable to assimilate the simple fact that for the first time in two years i was separated from my lolita all at once it occurred to me that her illness was somehow the development of a theme—that it had the same taste and tone as the series of linked impressions which had puzzled and tormented me during our journey i imagined that secret agent or secret lover  or prankster  or hallucination or whatever he was prowling around the hospital—andaurora had hardly “warmed her hands” as the pickers of lavender say in the coun try of my birth when i found myself trying to get into that dungeon again knocking upon its green doors breakfastless stoolless in despair  this was tuesday  and wednesday or thursday  splendidly reacting like the darling she was to some “serum” sparrow’ s sperm or dugo ng’s dung she was much better and the doctor said that in a couple of days she would be “skipping” again of the eight times i visited her the last one alone remain s sharply engraved on my mind it had been a great feat to come for i felt all hollowed out by the infection that by then was at work on me too none will know the strain it was to carry that bouquet that load of love those books that i had traveled sixty miles to buy browning’ s dramatic works the history of dancing clowns and columbines the russian ballet flowers of the rockies the theatr e guild anthology  tennis by helen wills who had won the nation al junior girl singles at the age of fifteen as i was stagge ring up to the door of my daughter ’s thirteen dollar aday private room mary lore the beastly young parttime nurse who had taken an unconcealed dislike to me emer ged with a finished breakfast tray  placed it with a quick crash on a chair in the corridor  and fundament jigging shot back into the room—probably to warn her poor little dolor es that the tyrannic old father was creeping up on crepe soles with books and bouquet the latter i had composed of wild flowers and beautiful leaves gathered with my own gloved hands on a mountain pass at sunrise i hardly slept at all that fateful week feeding my carmencita well idly i glanced at the tray on a yolk stained plate there was a crumpled envelope it had contained something since one edge was torn but there was no address on it—nothing at all save a phony armo rial design with “ponderosa lodge” in green letters thereupon i performed a chassécr oisé with mary  who was in the act of bustling out again—wonderful how fast they move and how little they do those rumpy young nurses she glowered at the envelope i had put back uncrumpled “you better not touch” she said nodding directionally  “could burn your fingers” below my dignity to rejoin all i said was “je croyais que c’était un bill—n ot a billet doux ” then enterin g the sunny room to lolita “ bonjour  mon petit ”“dolores” said mary lore entering with me past me throug h me the plump whore and blinking and starting to fold very rapidly a white flannel blanket as she blinked “dolores your pappy thinks you are getting letters from my boy friend it’s me smugly tapping herself on the small gilt cross she wore gets them and my pappy can parlayvoo as well as yours” she left the room dolores so rosy and russet lips freshly painted hair brilliantly brush ed bare arms straightened out on neat coverlet lay innocently beam ing at me or nothing on the bed table next to a paper napkin and a pencil her topaz ring burned in the sun “what gruesome funeral flowers ” she said “thanks all the same but do you mind very much cutting out the french it annoys everybody ” back at the usual rush came the ripe young hussy  reeking of urine and garlic with the deser et news  which her fair patient eagerly accepted ignoring the sumptuously illustrated volumes i had brought “my sister ann” said mary toppin g information with afterthought “works at the ponderosa place” poor bluebeard those brutal brothers estce que tu ne m’aimes plus ma carmen  she never had at the moment i knew my love was as hopeles s as ever—and i also knew the two girls were conspirators plotting in basque or zemfirian against my hopeless love i shall go further and say that lo was playing a double game since she was also fooling sentimental mary whom she had told i suppose that she wanted to dwell with her funloving young uncle and not with cruel melancholy me and another nurse whom i never identified and the village idiot who carted cots and coffins into the elevator  and the idiotic green love birds in a cage in the waiting room—all were in the plot the sordid plot i suppose mary thought comedy father professor humbertoldi was interfering with the romance between dolores and her father substitute rolypoly romeo for you were rather lardy  you know  rom despite all that “snow” and “joy juice” my throat hurt i stood swallowing at the window and stared at the mountains at the romantic rock high up in the smiling plotting sky  “my carmen” i said i used to call her that sometimes “we shall leave this raw sore town as soon as you get out of bed” “incidentally  i want all my clothes” said the gitanilla humping up her knees and turning to another page “… because really ” i continued “there is no point in staying here” “there is no point in staying anywhere” said lolitai lowered myself into a creto nne chair and opening the attractive botanical work attempted in the fever humming hush of the room to identify my flowers this proved impossible presently a musical bell softly sounded somewhere in the passage i do not think they had more than a dozen patients three or four were lunatics as lo had cheerfully informed me earlier in that show place of a hospital and the staff had too much leisure however—likewise for reasons of show—regula tions were rigid it is also true that i kept coming at the wrong hours not without a secret flow of dreamy malice  visionary mary next time it will be une belle dame toute en bleu floating through roaring gulch plucked me by the sleeve to lead me out i looked at her hand it dropped as i was leaving leaving voluntarily  dolores haze reminded me to bring her next morning … she did not remember where the various things she wanted were…“brin g me” she cried out of sight already  door on the move closing closed “the new gray suitcase and mother ’s trunk” but by next morning i was shivering and boozing and dying in the motel bed she had used for just a few minutes and the best i could do under the circular and dilating circumstances was to send the two bags over with the widow’ s beau a robust and kindly trucker  i imagined lo displaying her treasures to mary … no doubt i was a little delirious—and on the following day i was still a vibra tion rather than a solid for when i looked out of the bathroom window at the adjacent lawn i saw dolly ’s beautiful young bicycle propped up there on its support the graceful front wheel looking away from me as it always did and a sparrow perched on the saddle—but it was the landlady’ s bike and smiling a little and shaking my poor head over my fond fancies i tottered back to my bed and lay as quiet as a saint— saint  forsooth while brown dolores on a patch of sunny green with sanchicha reading stories in a movie magazine— —which was represented by numerous specimens wherever dolores landed and there was some great national celebration in town judging by the firecrackers veritable bombs that exploded all the time and at five minutesto two pm i heard the sound of whistling lips nearing the halfopened door of my cabin and then a thump upon it it was big frank he remained framed in the opened door  one hand on its jamb leaning forward a little howdy  nurse lore was on the telephone she wanted to know was i better and would i come today at twenty paces frank used to look a mountain of health at five as now he was a ruddy mosaic of scars—had been blown through a wall overseas but despite nameless injuries he was able to man a tremendous truck fish hunt drink and buoyantly dally with roadside ladies that day either because it was such a great holiday  or simply because he wanted to divert a sick man he had taken off the glove he usually wore on his left hand the one pressing against the side of the door and revealed to the fascinated sufferer not only an entire lack of fourth and fifth fingers but also a naked girl with cinnabar nipples and indigo delta charmingly tattooed on the back of his cripp led hand its index and middle digit making her legs while his wrist bore her flower crowned head oh delicious … reclining against the woodwork like some sly fairy  i asked him to tell mary lore i would stay in bed all day and would get into touch with my daughter sometime tomorrow if i felt probably polynesian he noticed the direction of my gaze and made her right hip twitch amorously  “okeydokey ” big frank sang out slapped the jamb and whistling carried my message away  and i went on drinking and by morning the fever was gone and although i was as limp as a toad i put on the purple dressing gown over my maize yellow pajamas and walked over to the office telephone ever ything was fine a bright voice informed me that yes everything was fine my daughter had checked out the day before around two her uncle mr gustave had called for her with a cocker spaniel pup and a smile for everyone and a black caddy lack and had paid dolly ’s bill in cash and told them to tell me i should not worry  and keep warm they were at grandpa’ s ranch as agreed elphinstone was and i hope still is a very cute little town it was spread like a maquette you know  with its neat greenwool trees and redroofed houses over the valley floor and i think i have alluded earlier to its model school and temple and spacious rectangular blocks some of which werecuriously enough just unconve ntional pastures with a mule or a unicorn grazing in the young july morning mist very amusing at one gravel groaning sharp turn i sideswiped a parked car but said to myself telestically —and telephathically i hoped to its gesticulating owner—t hat i would return later address bird school bird new bird the gin kept my heart alive but bemazed my brain and after some lapses and losses common to dream sequences i found myself in the reception room trying to beat up the doctor  and roaring at people under chairs and clamoring for mary who luckily for her was not there rough hands plucked at my dressing gown ripping off a pocket and somehow i seem to have been sitting on a bald brownheaded patient whom i had mistaken for dr blue and who eventually stood up remarking with a preposterous accent “now  who is nevrotic i ask”—and then a gaunt unsmiling nurse presented me with seven beautiful beautiful books and the exquisitely folded tartan lap robe and demanded a receipt and in the sudden silence i became aware of a policeman in the hallway  to whom my fellow motorist was pointing me out and meekly i signed the very symbolic receipt thus surrendering my lolita to all those apes but what else could i do one simp le and stark thought stood out and this was “freedom for the moment is everything” one false move— and i might have been made to explain a life of crime so i simula ted a coming out of a daze to my fellow motorist i paid what he thought was fair to dr blue who by then was stroking my hand i spoke in tears of the liquor i bolster ed too freely a tricky but not necessarily diseased heart with to the hospital in general i apologized with a flourish that almost bowled me over adding however that i was not on particularly good terms with the rest of the humbert clan to myself i whispered that i still had my gun and was still a free man—free to trace the fugitive free to destroy my brother   a thousandmile stretch of silksmooth road separated kasbeam  where to the best of my belief the red fiend had been scheduled to appear for the first time and fateful elphinstone which we had reached about a week before independence day the journey had taken up most of june for we had seldom made more than a hundred and fifty miles per traveling day spending the rest of the time up to five days in one case at various stopping places all of them also prearranged no doubt it was that stretch then along which the fiend’ s spoor should be sought and to this i devoted myself after several unmentionable days of dashing up and down the relentlessly radiating roads in the vicinity of elphinstone imagine me reader  with my shyness my distaste for any ostentation my inherent sense of the comme il faut imagine me masking the frenz y of my grief with a trembling ingratiating smile while devising some casual pretext to flip through the hotel register “oh” i would say “i am almost positive that i stayed here once—let me look up the entries for midjune—no i see i’m wrong after all—what a very quaint name for a home town kawtagain thanks very much” or “i had a customer staying her—i mislaid his address—may i …” and every once in a while especially if the operator of the place happened to be a certain type of gloomy male personal inspection of the books was denied me i have a memo here between july  and november  when i returned to beardsley for a few days i registered if not actually stayed at  hotels motels and tourist home s this figure includes a few registrations between chestn ut and beardsley  one of which yielded a shadow of the fiend “n petit larousse ill” i had to space and time my inquiries carefully so as not to attract undue attention and there must have been at least fifty places where i merely inquired at the desk—but that was a futile quest and i preferred building up a foundation of verisimilitud e and good will by first paying for an unneeded room my survey showed that of the  or so books inspected at least  provided me with a clue the loitering fiend had stoppe d even more often than we or else—he was quite capableof that—he had thrown in additional registrations in order to keep me well furnished with derisive hints only in one case had he actually stayed at the same motor court as we a few paces from lolita’ s pillow  in some instances he had taken up quarters in the same or in a neighboring block not infrequently he had lain in wait at an intermediate spot between two bespoken points how vividly i recalled lolita just before our departure from beardsley  prone on the parlor rug studying tour books and maps and marking laps and stops with her lipstick i discovered at once that he had foreseen my investigations and had planted insulting pseudonyms for my special benefit at the very first motel office i visited ponderosa lodge his entry  among a dozen obviously human ones read dr gratiano forbeson mirandola ny its italian comedy connot ations could not fail to strike me of course the landlady deigned to inform me that the gentleman had been laid up for five days with a bad cold that he had left his car for repairs in some garage or other and that he had checked out on the th of july yes a girl called ann lore had worked formerly at the lodge but was now married to a grocer in cedar city one moon lit night i wayla id whiteshoed mary on a solita ry street an automaton she was about to shriek but i managed to humanize her by the simple act of falling on my knees and with pious yelps imploring her to help she did not know a thing she swore who was this gratiano forbeson she seemed to waver  i whipped out a hundreddol lar bill she lifted it to the light of the moon “he is your brother” she whispered at last i plucked the bill out of her mooncold hand and spitting out a french curse turned and ran away  this taught me to rely on myself alone no detective could discover the clues trapp had tuned to my mind and manner i could not hope of course he would ever leave his correct name and address but i did hope he might slip on the glaze of his own subtlety  by daring say to introduce a richer and more personal shot of color than was strictly necessary  or by revealing too much through a qualitative sum of quantitative parts which reveale d too little in one thing he succeeded he succeeded in thoroughly enmes hing me and my thrashing anguish in his demoniacal game with infinite skill he swayed and staggered and regained an impo ssible balance always leaving me with the sportive hope —if i may use such a term in speaking of betrayal fury desola tion horror and hate—that he might give himself away next time he never did— though coming damn close to it we all admire the spangled acrobat withclassical grace meticulously walking his tight rope in the talcum light but how much rarer art there is in the sagging rope expert wearing scarecrow clothes and impersonating a grotesque drunk i should know  the clues he left did not establish his identity but they reflected his personality  or at least a certain homogenous and striking personality his genre his type of humor—at its best at least— the tone of his brain had affinities with my own he mimed and mocked me his allusions were definitely highb row he was wellread he knew french he was versed in logodaedaly and logomancy  he was an amateur of sex lore he had a feminine handwriting he would change his name but he could not disguise no matter how he slanted them his very peculiar t’s w’s and l’s quelquepart island was one of his favorite residences he did not use a fountain pen which fact as any psychoanalyst will tell you meant that the patient was a repressed undinist one mercifully hopes there are water nymphs in the styx his main trait was his passion for tantalization goodness what a tease the poor fellow was he challen ged my scholarship i am sufficiently proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing all and i daresay i missed some elements in that cryptogrammic paper chase what a shiver of triumph and loathing shook my frail frame when among the plain innocent names in the hotel recorder  his fiendish conundrum would ejaculate in my face i noticed that whenever he felt his enigmas were becoming too recondite even for such a solver as i he would lure me back with an easy one “arsène lupin” was obvious to a frenchman who remembered the detective stories of his youth and one hardly had to be a coleridgian to appreciate the trite poke of “a person porlock england” in horri ble taste but basically suggestive of a cultured man—not a policeman not a common goon  not a lewd salesman—were such assumed names as “arthur rainbow”—plainly the travestied author of le bateau bleu—let me laugh a little too gentlemen—and “morris schmetterling ” of l’oiseau ivre fame touché  reader the silly but funny “d orgon elmira ny” was from molière of course and because i had quite recently tried to interest lolita in a famous thcentury play i welcomed as an old friend “harry bumper  sheridan w yo” an ordinary encyclopedia informed me who the peculiar looking “phineas quimby  lebanon nh” was and any good freudian with a german name and some interest in religious prostitution should recognize at a glance the implication of “dr kitzler eryx miss” so far so good that sort of fun was shoddy but on the whole impersonal and thus innocuous among entries that arrested my attention as undoubtable clues per se but baffled me in respect to their finer points i do not care to mention many since i feel i am groping in a border land mist with verbal phantoms turning perhaps into living vacationists who was “johnny randall ramble ohio” or was he a real person who just happened to write a hand similar to “ns aristof f catagela ny” what was the sting in “catagela” and what about “james mavor morell hoaxton england” “aristophanes” “hoax”—fine but what was i missing there was one strain running through all that pseudonymity which caused me especially painful palpitations when i came across it such things as “g trapp geneva ny” was the sign of treachery on lolita’ s part “aubrey beardsley  quelquepart island” suggested more lucidly than the garbled telephone message had that the starting point of the affair should be looked for in the east “ lucas picador  merrymay  pa” insinuated that my carmen had betrayed my pathetic endearments to the impostor  horribly cruel forsooth was “will brown dolores colo” the gruesome “harold haze tombstone arizona” which at another time would have appealed to my sense of humor implied a familiarity with the girl’s past that in nightmare fashion suggested for a moment that my quarry was an old friend of the family  maybe an old flame of charlotte’ s maybe a redresser of wrongs “ donald quix sierra nev” but the most penetrating bodkin was the anagramtailed entry in the register of chestnut lodge “ted hunter  cane nh” the garbled license numbers left by all these persons and orgons and morells and trapps only told me that motel keepers omit to check if guests’ cars are accurately listed references—incompletely or incorrectly indicated—to the cars the fiend had hired for short laps between wace and elphinstone were of course useless the license of the initial aztec was a shimmer of shifting numerals some transposed others altered or omitted but somehow forming interrelated combinations such as “ws ” and “sh ” and “q” or “cu ” which however were so cunningly contrived as to never reveal a common denominator  it occurred to me that after he had turned that convertible over to accomplices at wace and switched to the stagemotor car system his successors migh t have been less careful and might have inscribed at somehotel office the archtype of those interrelated figures but if looking for the fiend along a road i knew he had taken was such a complicated vague and unprofitable business what could i expect from any attempt to trace unknown motorists traveling along unknown routes  by the time i reached bear dsley  in the course of the harrowing recapitulation i have now discu ssed at sufficient length a complete image had formed in my mind and through the—always risky—process of elimination i had reduced this image to the only concrete source that morbid cerebration and torpid memory could give it except for the rev rigor mortis as the girls called him and an old gentleman who taught nonobligatory german and latin there were no regular male teachers at beardsley school but on two occas ions an art instructor on the beardsley college faculty had come over to show the schoolgirls magic lantern pictures of french castles and nineteenthcentury paintings i had wanted to attend those projections and talks but dolly  as was her wont had asked me not to period i also remembered that gaston had referred to that particular lecturer as a brilliant garçon  but that was all memory refused to supply me with the name of the chateaulover  on the day fixed for the executi on i walked through the sleet across the campus to the information desk in maker hall beardsley college there i learned that the fellow’ s name was riggs rather like that of the minister that he was a bachelor  and that in ten minutes he would issue from the “museum” where he was having a class in the passage leading to the auditorium i sat on a marble bench of sorts donated by cecilia dalrymple ramble as i waited there in prostatic discomfort drunk sleepstarved with my gun in my fist in my raincoat pocket it suddenly occurred to me that i was deme nted and was about to do something stupid there was not one chance in a million that albert riggs ass prof was hiding my lolita at his beardsley home  pritchard road he could not be the villain it was absolutely preposterous i was losing my time and my wits he and she were in california and not here at all presently  i noticed a vague commotion behind some white statues a door—not the one i had been staring at—opened briskly  and amid a bevy of women students a baldish head and two bright brown eyes bobbed advancedhe was a total stranger to me but insisted we had met at a lawn party at beardsley schoo l how was my delightful tennisplaying daugh ter he had another class he would be seeing me another attempt at identification was less speedily resolved through an advertisement in one of lo’s magazines i dared to get in touch with a private detective an expugilist  and merely to give him some idea of the method adopted by the fiend i acquain ted him with the kind of names and addresses i had collected he demanded a goodish deposit and for two years —two years reader—that imbecile busied himself with checking those nonsense data i had long severed all monetary relations with him when he turned up one day with the triumphant information that an eightyyear old indian by the name of bill brown lived near dolores colo  this book is about lolita and now that i have reached the part which had i not been forestalled by another internal combustion martyr might be called “dolorès disparue ” there would be little sense in analyzing the three empty years that followed while a few pertinent points have to be marked the general impression i desire to convey is of a side door crash ing open in life’s full flight and a rush of roaring black time drowning with its whipping wind the cry of lone disaster  singularly enou gh i seldom if ever dreamed of lolita as i remembered her—as i saw her constantly and obsessively in my conscious mind during my daymares and insomnias more precisely she did haunt my sleep but she appeared there in strange and ludicrous disguises as valeria or charlotte or a cross between them that complex ghost would come to me shedding shift after shift in an atmosphere of great melancholy and disgust and would recline in dull invita tion on some narrow board or hard settee with flesh ajar like the rubber valve of a soccer ball’s bladder  i would find myself dentures fractured or hopelessly mislaid in horrible chambr es garnies where i would be entertained at tedious vivisecting parties that generally ended with charlotte or valeria weeping in my bleeding arms and being tenderly kissed by my brotherly lips in a dream disorder of auctioneered viennese bricàbrac pity impotence and the brown wigs of tragic old women who had just been gassed one day i removed from the car and destroyed an accumulation of teen magazines you know the sort stone age at

past at the time i felt i was merely losing contact with reality and after spending the rest of the winter and most of the following spring in a queb ec sanatorium where i had stayed before i resolved

rhymes correspond very exactly to certain perspectiveless and terrible landscapes and figures and magnified parts of landscap es and figures as drawn by psychopaths in tests devised by their astute trainers i wrote many more poems i immersed myself in the poetry of others but not for a second did i for get the load of revenge i would be a knave to say and the reader a fool to believe that the shock of losing lolita cured me of pederosis my accursed nature could not change no matter how my love for her did on playgrounds and beaches my sullen and stealthy eye against my will still sought out the flash of a nymphet’ s limbs the sly tokens of lolita’ s handmaids and rosegirls but one essential vision in me had withered never did i dwell now on possibilities of bliss with a little maiden specific or synthetic in some out oftheway place  never did my fancy sink its fangs into lolita’ s sisters farfar away  in the coves of evoked islands that was all over for the time being at least on the other hand alas two years of monstrous indulgence had left me with certain habits of lust i feared lest the void i lived in might drive me to plunge into the freedom of sudden insanity when confronted with a chance temptation in some lane between school and supp er solitude was corrupting me i needed company and care my heart was a hysterical unreliable or gan this is how rita enters the picture  she was twice lolita’ s age and three quarters of mine a very slight dark haired paleski nned adult weighing a hundred and five pounds with charmingly asym metrical eyes an angular  rapidly sketched profile and a most appealing ensellur e to her supple back—i think she had some spanish or babylonian blood i picked her up one depraved may evening somewhere between montreal and new york or more narrowly  between toylestown and blake at a darkishly burning bar under the sign of the tigermoth where she was amiably drunk she insisted we had gone to school together  and she placed her trembling little hand on my ape paw my senses were very slightly stirred but i decided to give her a try i did— and adop ted her as a constant companion she was so kind was rita such a good sport that i daresay she would have given herself to any pathetic creature or fallacy  an old broke n tree or a bereaved porcupine out of sheer chumminess and compassion when i first met her she had but recently divorced her third husband— and a little more recently had been abandoned by her seven th cavalier servant —the others the mutables were too numerous and mobile to tabulate her brother was—and no doubt still is—a prominent pastyfaced suspendersandpaintedtiewearing politician mayor and booster of his ballplaying biblereading grainhandling home town for the last eight years he had been paying his great little sister several hundred dollars per month under the stringent condi tion that she would never never enter great little grainball city she told me with wails of wonder  that for some god damn reason every new boy friend of hers would first of all take her grainballward it was a fatal attraction and before she knew what was what she would find herself sucked into the lunar orbit of the town and would be following the floodlit drive that encircled it—“going round and round” as she phrased it “like a goddamn mulberry moth” she had a natty little coupé and in it we traveled to california so as to give my venerab le vehicle a rest her natural speed was ninety  dear rita we cruised together for two dim years from summer  to summer and she was the sweetest simplest gentlest dumbest rita imaginable in comparison to her  valechka was a schlegel and charlotte a hegel there is no earthly reason why i should dally with her in the margin of this sinister memoir  but let me say hi rita—wherever you are drunk or hangoverish rita hi that she was the most soothing the most comprehending companion that i ever had and certainly saved me from the madhouse i told her i was trying to trace a girl and plug that girl’s bully  rita solemnly approved of the plan—and in the course of some investigation she undertook on her own witho ut really knowing a thing around san humbertino got entangled with a pretty awful crook herself i had the devil of a time retrieving her—used and bruised but still cocky  then one day she proposed playing russian roule tte with my sacred automatic i said you couldn’ t it was not a revolver  and we struggled for it until at last it went off touching off a very thin and very comical spurt of hot water from the hole it made in the wall of the cabin room i remember her shrieks of laughter  the oddly prepubescent curve of her back her ricey skin her slow languorous columbine kisses kept me from mischief it is not the artistic aptitudes that are secondary sexual characters as some shams and shamans have said it is the other way around sex is but the ancilla of art one rather mysterious spree that had interesting repercussions i must notice i had abandoned the search the fiend was either in tartary or burning away in my cerebellum the flames fanned by my fancy and grief but certainly not having dolores haze play champion tennis on the pacific coast one afternoon on our way back east in a hideous hotel the kind where they hold conventions and where labeled fat pink men stagger around all first names and business and booze—dear rita and i awoke to find a third in our room a blond almost albino young fellow with white eyelash es and large transparent ears whom neither rita nor i recalled having ever seen in our sad lives  sweating in thick dirty underwear  and with old army boots on he lay snoring on the double bed beyond my chaste rita one of his front teeth was gone amber pustules grew on his forehead ritochka enveloped her sinuous nudity in my raincoat— the first thing at hand i slipped on a pair of candystriped drawers and we took stock of the situation five glasses had been used which in the way of clues was an embarrassment of riches the door was not properly closed a sweater and a pair of shapeless tan pants lay on the floor  we shook their owner into miserable consciousness hewas completely amnesic in an accent that rita recognized as pure brooklynese he peevishly insin uated that somehow we had purloined his worthless identity  we rushed him into his clothes and left him at the nearest hospital realizing on the way that somehow or other after forgotten gyrations we were in grainball  half a year later rita wrote the doctor for news jack humbertson as he had been tastelessly dubbed was still isolated from his personal past oh mnemosyne sweetest and most mischievous of muses i would not have mentioned this incident had it not started a chain of ideas that resulted in my publishing in the cantrip review an essay on “mimir and memory ” in which i suggested among other things that seemed original and important to that splendid review’ s benevolent readers a theory of perceptual time based on the circulation of the blood and conceptually depending to fill up this nutshell on the mind’ s being conscious not only of matter but also of its own self thus creating a continuous spanning of two points the storable future and the stored past in result of this venture —and in culmination of the impression made by my previous travaux —i was called from new york where rita and i were living in a little flat with a view of gleaming children taking shower baths far below in a fountainous arbor of central park to cantrip college four hundred miles away for one year i lodged there in special apartments for poets and philosophers from september  to june  while rita whom i preferre d not to display vegetated—somewhat indecorously  i am afraid—in a roadside inn where i visited her twice a week then she vanished—more humanly than her predecessor had done a month later i found her in the local jail she was trés digne  had had her appendix removed and managed to convince me that the beautiful bluish furs she had been accused of stealing from a mrs roland maccru m had really been a spontaneous if somewhat alcoholic gift from roland himself i succeeded in getting her out withou t appealing to her touchy brother  and soon afterwards we drove back to central park west by way of briceland where we had stopped for a few hours the year before a curious urge to relive my stay there with lolita had got hold of me i was entering a phase of existence where i had given up all hope of tracing her kidnaper and her i now attempted to fall back on old setting s in order to save what still could be saved in the way of souvenir  souvenir que me veux tu autumn was ringing in the air to a post card requesting twin bedsprofessor hambur g got a prompt expression of regret in reply  they were full up they had one bathless basement room with four beds which they thought i would not want their note paper was headed the enchanted hunters near churches no dogs all legal beverages i wondered if the last statement was true all did they have for instance sidewalk grenadine i also wondered if a hunter  enchanted or otherwise would not need a pointer more than a pew and with a spasm of pain i recalled a scene worthy of a great artist petite nymphe accroupie  but that silky cocker spaniel had perhaps been a baptized one no—i felt i could not endure the throes of revisitin g that lobby  there was a much better possibility of retrievable time elsewhere in soft richcolored autumnal briceland leaving rita in a bar i made for the town library  a twittering spinster was only too glad to help me disinter midaugust  from the bound briceland gazette  and presently  in a secluded nook under a naked light i was turning the enormous and fragile pages of a cof finblack volume almost as big as lolita reader bruder what a foolish hambur g that hambur g was since his supersensitive system was loath to face the actual scene he thought he could at least enjoy a secret part of it—which reminds one of the tenth or twentieth soldier in the raping queue who throws the girl’s black shawl over her white face so as not to see those impossible eyes while taking his military pleasure in the sad sacked village what i lusted to get was the printed picture that had chanced to absorb my trespassing image while the gazette’ s photogr apher was concentrating on dr braddock and his group passionately i hoped to find preserved the portrait of the artist as a younge r brute an innocent camera catching me on my dark way to lolita’ s bed— what a magnet for mnemosyne i cannot well explain the true nature of that urge of mine it was allied i suppose to that swooning curiosity which impels one to examine with a magnifying glass bleak little figures—still life practically  and everybody about to throw up—at an early morning execution and the patient’ s expression impossible to make out in the print anyway  i was literally gasping for breath and one corner of the book ofdoom kept stabbing me in the stomach while i scanned and skimmed … brute force and possessed were coming on sunday  the th to both theatres mr purdom independent tobacco auctioneer  said that ever since  he had

figure in white and dr braddock in black but whatever spectral shoulder was brushing against his ample form— nothing of myself could i make out i went to find rita who introduced me with her vin triste smile to a pocketsized wizened truculentl y tight old man saying this was—what was the name again son—a former schoolmate of hers he tried to retain her and in the sligh t scuffle that followed i hurt my thumb against his hard head in the silent painted park where i walked her and aired her a little she sobbed and said i would soon soon leave her as everybody had and i sang her a wistful french ballad and strung together some fugitive rhymes to amuse her the place was called enchanted hunters  query what indian dyes diana did thy dell endorse to make of picture lake a very blood bath of trees before the blue hotel she said “why blue when it is white why blue for heaven’ s sake” and started to cry again and i marched her to the car and we drove on to new york and soon she was reasona bly happy again high up in the haze on the little terrace of our flat i notice i have somehow mixed up two events my visit with rita to briceland on our way to cantrip and our passing through briceland again on our way back to new york but such suffusions of swimming colors are not to be disdained by the artist in recollection  my letterbox in the entrance hall belonged to the type that allows one to glimpse someth ing of its contents through a glassed slit several times already  a trick of harlequin light that fell through the glass upon an alien handwriting had twisted it into a semblance of lolita’ s script causing me almost to collapse as i leant against an adjacent urn almost my own whenever that happened—whenever her lovely  loopy  childish scrawl was horribly transfor med into the dull hand of one of my few corresp ondents—i used to recollect with anguishe d amusement the times in my trustful pre dolorian past when i would be misled by a jewelbright window opposite wherein my lurking eye the ever alert periscope of my shameful vice would make out from afar a halfnaked nymphet stilled in the act of combing her aliceinw onderland hair there was in the fiery phantasm a perfection which made my wild delight also perfect just because the vision was out of reach with no possibility of attainment to spoil it by the awareness of an appended taboo indeed it may well be that the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpi dity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promised—the great rosegray never tobehad mes fenětr es hanging above blotched sunset and welling night grinding my teeth i would crowd all the demons of my desire against the railing of a throbbing balcony it would be ready to take off in the apricot and black humid eveni ng did take off—whereupon the lighted image would move and eve would revert to a rib and there would be nothing in the window but an obese partly clad man reading the paper  since i sometim es won the race between my fancy and nature’ s reality  the deception was bearable unbearable pain began when chance entered the fray and deprived me of the smile meant for me “savezvous qu’à dix ans ma petite était folle de vous” said a woman i talked to at a tea in paris and the petite had just married  miles away  and i could not even remember if i had ever noticed her in that garden next to those tennis courts a dozenyears before and now likewise the radiant foreglimpse the promise of reality  a promis e not only to be simu lated seductively but also to be nobly held—all this chance denied me—chance and a change to smaller characters on the pale belov ed writer ’s part my fancy was both proustianized and procrusteanized for that particular morning late in september   as i had come down to grope for my mail the dapper and bilious janitor with whom i was on execrable terms started to complain that a man who had seen rita home recently had been “sick like a dog” on the front steps in the process of listening to him and tipping him and then listening to a revised and politer version of the incident i had the impression that one of the two letters which that blessed mail brought was from rita’s mother a crazy little woman whom we had once visited on cape cod and who kept writing me to my various addresses saying how wonderfully well matched her daughter and i were and how wonderful it would be if we married the other letter which i opened and scanned rapidly in the elevator was from john farlow  i have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader ’s mind no matter how many times we reopen “king lear” never shall we find the good king banging his tankard in high revelry  all woes forgotten at a jolly reunion with all three daughters and their lapdogs never will emm a rally revived by the sympathetic salts in flaubert’ s father ’s timely tear whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers his fate is fixed in our minds and similarly  we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them thus x will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the secondrate symphonies he has accustomed us to y will never commit murder  under no circumstances can z ever betray us we have it all arranged in our minds and the less often we see a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical w e would prefer not to have known at all our neighbor  the retired hotdog stand operato r if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen i am saying all this in order to explain how bewildered i was by farlow’ s hysterical letter  i knew his wife had died but i certainly expected him to remain throughout a devout widowhood the dull sedate and reliableperson he had always been now he wrote that after a brief visit to the us he had returned to south america and had decided that whatever affairs he had controlled at ramsdale he would hand over to jack windm uller of that town a lawyer whom we both knew  he seemed particularly relieved to get rid of the haze “complications” he had married a spanish girl he had stopped smoking and had gained thirty pounds she was very young and a ski champion they were going to india for their honeymonsoon since he was “building a family” as he put it he would have no time henceforth for my affairs which he termed “very strange and very aggravating” busybodies—a whole committee of them it appeared—had informed him that the wherea bouts of little dolly haze were unknown and that i was living with a notorious divorcee in california his father inlaw was a count and exceedingly wealthy  the people who had been renting the haze house for some years now wished to buy it he suggested that i better produce dolly quick he had broken his leg he enclosed a snapshot of himself and a brunette in white wool beaming at each other among the snows of chile i remember letting myself into my flat and starting to say well at least we shall now track them down—when the other letter began talking to me in a small matter offact voice dear dad how’ s everything i’m married i’m going to have a baby  i guess he’s going to be a big one i guess he’ll come right for christmas this is a hard letter to write i’m going nuts because we don’t have enough to pay our debts and get out of here dick is promised a big job in alaska in his very specialized corner of the mechanical field that’s all i know abou t it but it’s really grand pardon me for withhol ding our home address but you may still be mad at me and dick must not know  this town is something you can’t see the morons for the smog please do send us a check dad we could manage with three or four hundred or even less anything is welcome you might sell my old things because once we get there the dough will just start rolling in write please i have gone through much sadness and hardship yours expecting d olly m rs richard f schiller    i was again on the road again at the wheel of the old blue sedan again alone rita had still been dead to the world when i read that letter and fought the mountains of agony it raised within me i had glanced at her as she smiled in her sleep and had kissed her on her moist brow  and had left her forever with a note of tender adieu which i taped to her navel— otherwise she might not have found it “alone” did i say pas tout à fait i had my little black chum with me and as soon as i reached a secluded spot i rehearsed mr richard f schiller ’s violent death i had found a very old and very dirty gray sweater of mine in the back of the car and this i hung up on a branch in a speechless glade which i had reached by a wood road from the now remote highway  the carrying out of the sentence was a little marred by what seemed to me a certain stiffness in the play of the trigger  and i wondered if i should get some oil for the mysterious thing but decided i had no time to spare back into the car went the old dead sweater  now with additional perforations and having reloaded warm chum i continued my journey  the letter was dated september   this was september  and the address she gave was “general delivery  coalmont” not “va” not “pa” not “tenn”—and not coalmont anyway—i have camouflaged everything my love inquiries showed this to be a small industrial community some eight hundre d miles from new york city at first i planned to drive all day and all night but then thought better of it and rested for a couple of hours around dawn in a motor court room a few miles before reaching the town i had made up my mind that the fiend this schiller  had been a car salesman who had perhaps got to know my lolita by givin g her a ride in beardsley—the day her bike blew a tire on the way to miss empero r—and that he had got into some trouble since then the corpse of the executed sweater  no matter how i changed its contours as it lay on the back seat of the car had kept revealing various outlines pertaining to trappschiller—the grossness and obscene bonhommie of his body  and to counteract this taste of coarse corruption i resolved to makemyself especially handsome and smart as i pressed home the nipple of my alarm clock before it exploded at the set hour of six am then with the stern and romantic care of a gentleman about to fight a duel i checked the arrangement of my papers bathed and perfumed my delicate body  shaved my face and chest selected a silk shirt and clean drawers pulled on transparent taupe socks and congratulated myself for having with me in my trunk some very exquisite clothes—a waistcoat with nacreous buttons for instance a pale cashmere tie and so on i was not able alas to hold my breakfast but dismissed that physicality as a trivial contretemps wiped my mouth with a gossamer handkerchief produced from my sleeve and with a blue block of ice for heart a pill on my tongue and solid death in my hip pocket i stepped neatly into a telephone booth in coalmont ahahah said its little door and rang up the only schiller—p aul furniture—to be found in the battered book hoarse paul told me he did know a richard the son of a cousin of his and his address was let me see  killer street i am not going very far for my pseudonyms ahahah said the little door  at  killer street a tenement house i interviewed a number of dejected old people and two longhaired strawberryblond incredibly grubby nymphets rather abstractly  just for the heck of it the ancient beast in me was casting about for some lightly clad child i might hold against me for a minute after the killing was over and nothing mattered any more and everything was allowed yes dick skiller had lived there but had moved when he married nobody knew his address “they might know at the store” said a bass voice from an open manhole near which i happened to be standing with the two thinar med barefoot little girls and their dim grandmothers i entered the wrong store and a wary old negro shook his head even before i could ask anything i crossed over to a bleak grocery and there summoned by a customer at my request a woman’ s voice from some wooden abyss in the floor  the manhole’ s counterpart cried out hunter road last house hunter road was miles away  in an even more dismal district all dump and ditch and wormy vegetable garden and shack and gray drizzle and red mud and several smoking stacks in the distance i stopped at the last “house”—a clapboard shack with two or three similar ones farther away from the road and a waste of withered weeds all around sounds of hammering came from behind the house and for several minute s i sat quitestill in my old car old and frail at the end of my journey  at my gray goal finis my friends finis my fiends the time was around two my pulse was  one minute and  the next the drizzle crepitated against the hood of the car my gun had migrated to my right trouser pocket a nondescript cur came out from behind the house stopped in surprise and started good naturedly woofwoofing at me his eyes slit his shaggy belly all muddy  and then walked about a little and woofed once more  i got out of the car and slamme d its door how matter offact how square that slam sounded in the void of the sunless day woof commented the dog perfunctorily  i pressed the bell button it vibrated through my whole system personne je resonne repersonne  from what depth this re nonsense woof said the dog a rush and a shuffle and woosh woof went the door  couple of inches taller  pinkrimmed glasses new heapedup hairdo new ears how simple the moment the death i had kept conjuring up for three years was as simple as a bit of dry wood she was frankly and hugely pregnant her head looked smal ler only two seconds had passed really  but let me give them as much wooden duration as life can stand and her palefreckled cheeks were hollowed and her bare shins and arms had lost all their tan so that the little hairs showed she wore a brown sleeveless cotton dress and sloppy felt slippers “we—e—ell” she exhaled after a pause with all the emphasis of wonder and welcome “husband at home” i croaked fist in pocket i could not kill her of course as some have thought y ou see i loved her  it was love at first sight at last sight at ever and ever sight “come in” she said with a vehement cheerful note against the splintery deadwood of the door dolly schiller flattened herself as best she could even rising on tiptoe a little to let me pass and was crucified for a moment looking down smiling down at the threshold hollowcheeked with round pommettes  her wateredmilkwhite arms outspread on the wood i passed without touching her bulging babe dollysmell with a faint fried addition my teeth chattere d like an idiot’ s “no you stay out” to the dog she closed the door and followed me and her belly into the dollhouse parlor  “dick’ s down there” she said pointing with an invisible tennis racket inviting my gaze to travel from the drab parlor bedroom wher e we stood right across the kitchen and through the backdoorway where in a ratherprimitive vista a darkhaired young stranger in overalls instantaneously reprieved was perched with his back to me on a ladder fixing something near or upon the shack of his neighbor  a plumper fellow with only one arm who stood looking up this pattern she explained from afar  apologetically “men will be men” should she call him in no standing in the middle of the slanting room and emitting questioning “hm’ s” she made familiar javanese gestures with her wrists and hands offering me in a brief display of humorous courtesy  to choose between a rocker and the divan their bed after ten pm i say “familiar” because one day she had welcomed me with the same wrist dance to her party in beardsley  we both sat down on the divan curious although actually her looks had faded i definitely realized so hopelessly late in the day how much she looke d—had always looked—like botticelli’ s russet venus—the same soft nose the same blurred beauty  in my pocket my fingers gently let go and repacked a little at the tip within the handkerchief it was nested in my unused weapon “that’ s not the fellow i want” i said the diffuse look of welcome left her eyes her forehead puckered as in the old bitter days “not who ” “where is he quick” “look” she said inclining her head to one side and shaking it in that position “look you are not going to bring that up” “i certai nly am” i said and for a moment—strangely enough the only merciful endurable one in the whole interview—we were bristling at each other as if she were still mine a wise girl she controlled herself dick did not know a thing of the whole mess he thought i was her father  he thought she had run away from an upperclass home just to wash dishes in a diner  he believed anything why should i want to make things harder than they were by raking up all that muck but i said she must be sensible she must be a sensible girl with her bare drum unde r that thin brow n stuff she must understand that if she expected the help i had come to give i must have at least a clear comprehension of the situation“come his name” she thought i had guessed long ago it was with a mischievous and melancholy smile such a sensational name i would never believe it she could hardly believe it herself his name my fall nymph it was so unimportant she said she suggested i skip it would i like a cigarette no his name she shook her head with great resolution she guessed it was too late to raise hell and i would never believe the unbelievably unbelievable— i said i had better go regards nice to have seen her  she said really it was useless she would never tell but on the other hand after all—“do you really want to know who it was w ell it was—” and softly confidentially  arching her thin eyebrows and puckering her parched lips she emitted a little mockingly  somewhat fastidiously  not untenderly  in a kind of muted whistle the name that the astute reader has guessed long ago waterproof why did a flash from hour glass lake cross my consciousness i too had known it without knowing it all along there was no shock no surprise quietly the fusion took place and everything fell into order into the pattern of branches that i have woven throughout this memoir with the express purpose of having the ripe fruit fall at the right moment yes with the express and perverse purpose of rendering—she was talking but i sat melting in my golden peace—of rendering that golden and monstrous peace through the satisfaction of logical recognition  which my most inimical reader should experience now  she was as i say talking it now came in a relaxed flow he was the only man she had ever been crazy about what about dick oh dick was a lamb they were quite happy together  but she meant something different and i had never counted of course she considered me as if grasping all at once the incredible—and somehow tedious confusing and unnecessary—fact that the distant elegant slender  fortyyear old valetudinarian in velvet coat sitting beside her had known and adored every pore and follicle of her pubescent body  in her washedout gray eyes strangely spectacled our poor romance was for a moment reflected pondered upon and dismissed like a dull party like arainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come like a humdrum exercise like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood i just managed to jerk my knee out of the range of a sketchy tap—one of her acquired gestures she asked me not to be dense the past was the past i had been a good father  she guessed—granting me that proceed dolly schiller  well did i know that he had known her mother that he was practically an old friend that he had visited with his uncle in ramsdale—oh years ago—and spoke n at mother ’s club and had tugged and pulled her dolly  by her bare arm onto his lap in front of everybody  and kissed her face she was ten and furious with him did i know he had seen me and her at the inn where he was writing the very play she was to rehearse in beardsley  two years later did i know—it had been horrid of her to sidetrack me into believing that clare was an old female maybe a relative of his or a sometime lifemate—and oh what a close shave it had been when the wace journal carried his picture the briceland gazette had not y es very amusing yes she said this world was just one gag after another  if somebody wrote up her life nobody would ever believe it at this point there came brisk homey sounds from the kitchen into which dick and bill had lumbered in quest of beer through the doorway they noticed the visitor  and dick entered the parlor  “dick this is my dad” cried dolly in a resounding violent voice that struck me as totally strange and new and cheerful and old and sad because the young fellow  veteran of a remote war  was hard of hearing arctic blue eyes black hair ruddy cheeks unshaven chin we shook hands discreet bill who eviden tly took pride in working wonders with one hand brought in the beer cans he had opened wanted to withdraw  the exquisite courtes y of simple folks was made to stay a beer ad in point of fact i preferred it that way and so did the schillers i switched to the jittery rocker  avidly munching dolly plied me with marshmallows and potato chips the men looked at her fragile frileux  diminutive oldworld youngish but sickly  father in velvet coat and beige vest maybe a viscount they were under the impression i had come to stay  and dick with a great wrinkling of brows that denoted difficult thought suggested dolly and he might sleep in the kitchen on a spare mattress i waved a light hand and told dolly who transmitted it by means of a special shout to dick that i hadmerely dropped in on my way to readsbur g where i was to be entertained by some friends and admirers it was then noticed that one of the few thumbs remaining to bill was bleeding not such a wonder work er after all how womanish and somehow never seen that way before was the shadowy divison between her pale breasts when she bent down over the man’s hand she took him for repairs to the kitchen for a few minutes three or four little eternities which positively welled with artificial warmth dick and i remained alone he sat on a hard chair rubbing his forelimbs and frowning i had an idle urge to squeeze out the blackheads on the wings of his perspiring nose with my long agate claws he had nice sad eyes with beautiful lashes and very white teeth his adam’ s apple was large and hairy  why don’t they shave better those young brawny chaps he and his dolly had had unrestrained intercourse on that couch there at least a hundred and eighty times probably much more and before that—how long had she known him no grudge  funny—no grudge at all nothing except grief and nausea he was now rubbing his nose i was sure that when finally he woul d open his mouth he would say slightly shaking his head “aw she’s a swell kid mr haze she sure is and she’s going to make a swell mother ” he opened his mouth —and took a sip of beer this gave him countenance—and he went on sipping till he frothed at the mouth he was a lamb he had cupped her florentine breas ts his fingernails were black and broken but the phalanges the whole carpus the strong shapely wrist were far far finer than mine i have hurt too much too many bodies with my twisted poor hands to be proud of them french epithets a dorset yokel’ s knuckles an austrian tailor ’s flat finger tips—that’ s humbert humbert good if he was silent i could be silent too indeed i could very well do with a little rest in this subdued frightenedtodeath rocking chair before i drove to wherever the beast’ s lair was—and then pulle d the pistol’ s foreskin back and then enjoyed the orgasm of the crushed trigger i was always a good little follower of the viennese medic ine man but presently i became sorry for poor dick whom in some hypnotoid way i was horribly preventing from making the only remark he could think up “she’ s a swell kid …” “and so” i said “you are going to canada” in the kitchen dolly was laughing at something bill had said or done “and so” i shouted “you are going to canada not canada”—i re shouted—“i mean alaska of course”he nursed his glass and noddi ng sagely  replied “well he cut it on a jagger  i guess lost his right arm in italy ” lovely mauve almond trees in bloom a blownof f surrealistic arm hanging up there in the pointillistic mauve a flower girl tattoo on the hand dolly and bandaided bill reappeared it occurred to me that her ambiguous brow n and pale beauty excited the cripple dick with a grin of relief stood up he guessed bill and he would be going back to fix those wires he guess ed mr haze and dolly had loads of things to say to each other  he guesse d he would be seeing me before i left why do those people guess so much and shave so little and are so disdainful of hearing aids “sit down” she said audibly striking her flanks with her palms i relapsed into the black rocker  “so you betrayed me where did you go where is he now” she took from the mantelpiece a concave glossy snapshot old woman in white stout beaming bowleg ged very short dress old man in his shirtsleeves drooping mustache watch chain her inlaws living with dick’ s brother ’s family in juneau “sure you don’ t want to smoke” she was smoking herself first time i saw her doing it streng verboten under humbert the terrible gracefully  in a blue mist charlott e haze rose from her grave i would find him through uncle ivory if she refused “betrayed you no” she directed the dart of her cigarette index rapidly tapping upon it toward the hearth exactly as her mother used to do and then like her mother  oh my god with her fingernail scratched and removed a fragment of cigarette paper from her underlip no she had not betrayed me i was among friends edusa had warned her that cue liked little girls had been almost jailed once in fact nice fact and he knew she knew  yes … elbow in palm puff smile exhaled smoke darting gesture waxing reminisc ent he saw—smiling—through everything and everybody  because he was not like me and her but a genius a great guy full of fun had rocked with laughter when she confessed about me and her  and said he had thought so it was quite safe under the circumstances to tell him … well cue—they all called him cue— her camp five years ago curious coincidence—… took her to a dude ranch about a day’s drive from elephant elphinstone named  oh some silly name— duk duk ranch— you know just plain silly—but it did not matter now anyway  because the place had vanished and disintegratedreally  she meant i could not imagine how utterly lush that ranch was she meant it had everything but everything even an indoor wate rfall did i remember the redhaired guy we “we” was good had once had some tennis with well the place really belonged to red’ s brother  but he had turned it over to cue for the summer  when cue and she came the others had them actually go through a coronation ceremony and then—a terrific ducking as when you cross the equator  you know  her eyes rolled in synthetic resignation “go on please” well the idea was he would take her in september to hollyw ood and arrange a tryout for her a bit part in the tennismatch scene of a movie picture based on a play of his— golden guts —and perhaps even have her double one of its sensational starlets on the kliegstruck tennis court alas it never came to that “where is the hog now” he was not a hog he was a great guy in many respects but it was all drink and drugs and of course he was a complete freak in sex matters and his friends were his slaves i just could not imagine i humbert could not imagine what they all did at duk duk ranch she refused to take part because she loved him and he threw her out “what things” “oh weird filthy  fancy things i mean he had two girls and two boys and three or four men and the idea was for all of us to tangle in the nude while an old woman took movie pictures” sade’ s justine was twelve at the start “what things exactly” “oh things … oh i—really i”—she uttered the “i” as a subdued cry while she listened to the source of the ache and for lack of words spread the five fingers of her angularly upanddownmoving hand no she gave it up she refused to go into particulars with that baby inside her  that made sense “it is of no importance now” she said pounding a gray cushion with her fist and then lying back belly up on the divan “crazy things filthy things i said no i’m just not going to she used in all insoucian ce really  a disgusting slang term which in a literal french translation would be souffler  your beastly boys because i want only you well he kicked me out”there was not much else to tell that winter  fay and she had found jobs for almost two years she had—oh just drifted oh doing some restaurant work in small places and then she had met dick no she did not know where the other was in new york she guessed of course he was so famous she would have found him at once if she had wanted fay had tried to get back to the ranch—and it just was not there any more—it had burned to the ground nothing remained just a charred heap of rubbish it was so strange  so strange — she closed her eyes and opened her mouth leaning back on the cushion one felted foot on the floor  the wooden floor slanted a little steel ball would have rolled into the kitchen i knew all i wanted to know  i had no intention of torturing my darling somewhere beyond bill’s shack an afterwork radio had begun singing of folly and fate and there she was with her ruined looks and her adult ropeveined narrow hands and her goose flesh white arms  and her shallo w ears and her unkempt armpi ts there she was my lolita hopelessly worn at seventeen with that baby  dreaming already in her of becoming a big shot and retiring around  ad—and i looked and looked at her and knew as clearly as i know i am to die that i loved her more than anything i had ever seen or imagined on earth or hoped for anywh ere else she was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nymphet i had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past an echo on the brink of a russet ravine with a far wood under a white sky and brown leaves choking the brook and one last cricket in the crisp weeds … but thank god it was not that echo alone that i worshiped what i used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart mon grand pécbé radieux  had dwindled to its essence sterile and selfish vice all that i canceled and cursed y ou may jeer at me and threaten to clear the court but until i am gagged and halfthrot tled i will shout my poor truth i insist the world know how much i loved my lolita this lolita pale and polluted and big with another ’s child but still grayeyed still sootylashed still auburn and almond still carmencita still mine changeons de vie ma carmen allons vivre quelque part où nous ne serons jamais séparés ohio the wilds of massac husetts no matter  even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish and her nipples swell and crack and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torn—even then i would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face at the mere sound of your raucous young voice my lolita“lolita” i said “this may be neither here nor there but i have to say it life is very short from here to that old car you know so well there is a stretch of twenty  twentyfive paces it is a very short walk make those twentyfive steps now  right now come just as you are and we shall live happily ever after ” carmen voulezvous venir avec moi “you mean” she said opening her eyes and raising herself slightly  the snake that may strike “you mean you will give us us that money only if i go with you to a motel is that what you mean” “no” i said “you got it all wrong i want you to leave your incidental dick and this awful hole and come to live with me and die with me and everything with me” words to that ef fect “you’re crazy ” she said her features working “think it over lolita there are no strings attached except perhaps— well no matter ” a reprieve i wanted to say but did not “any way if you refuse you will still get your … trousseau ” “no kidding” asked dolly  i handed her an envelope with four hundred dollars in cash and a check for three thousand six hundred more gingerly  uncertainly  she received mon petit cadeau and then her forehead becam e a beautiful pink “you mean” she said with agonized emphasis “you are giving us four thousand bucks ” i cove red my face with my hand and broke into the hottest tears i had ever shed i felt them winding through my fingers and down my chin and burning me and my nose got clogged and i could not stop and then she touched my wrist “i’ll die if you touch me” i said “you are sure you are not coming with me is there no hope of your coming t ell me only this” “no” she said “no honey  no” she had never called me honey before “no” she said “it is quite out of the question i would sooner go back to cue i mean—” she groped for words i supplied them mentally “he broke my heart you merely broke my life” “i think” she went on—“oops”—the envelope skidded to the floor—she picked it up—“i think it’s oh utterly grand of you to give us all that dough it settles everything we can start next week stop crying please youshould understand let me get you some more beer oh don’t cry i’m so sorry i cheated so much but that’ s the way things are” i wiped my face and my fingers  she smiled at the cadeau  she exulted she wanted to call dick i said i would have to leave in a moment did not want to see him at all at all we tried to think of some subject of conversation for some reason  i kept seeing—it trembled and silkily glowed on my damp retina—a radiant child of twelve sitting on a threshold “pinging” pebbles at an empty can i almost said—tr ying to find some casual remark—“i wonder sometimes what has become of the little mccoo girl did she ever get better”—but stopped in time lest she rejoin “i wond er sometimes what has become of the little haze girl …” finally  i reverted to money matters that sum i said represented more or less the net rent from her mother ’s house she said “had it not been sold years ago” no i admit i had told her this in order to sever all connections with r a lawyer would send a full account of the financial situation later it was rosy some of the small securities her mother had owned had gone up and up yes i was quite sure i had to go i had to go and find him and destroy him since i would not have survived the touch of her lips i kept retreating in a mincing dance at every step she and her belly made toward me she and the dog saw me off i was surprised this a rhetorical figure i was not that the sight of the old car in which she had ridden as a child and a nymph et left her so very indifferent all she remarked was it was getting sort of purplish about the gills i said it was hers i could go by bus she said don’t be silly they would fly to jupiter and buy a car there i said i would buy this one from her for five hundred dollars “at this rate we’ll be millionnaires next” she said to the ecstatic dog carmencita lui demandaisje … “one last word” i said in my horrible careful english “are you quite quite sure that—well not tomorrow  of course and not after tomorrow  but—well—some day any day you will not come to live with me i will create a brand new god and thank him with piercing cries if you give me that microscopic hope” to that ef fect “no” she said smiling “no” “it would have made all the dif ference” said humbert humbert then i pulled out my automatic—i mean this is the kind of fool thing a reader might suppose i did it never even occurred to me to do it“good byaye” she chanted my american sweet immortal dead love for she is dead and immortal if you are reading this i mean such is the formal agreement with the socalled authorities then as i drove away  i heard her shout in a vibrant voice to her dick and the dog started to lope alongside my car like a fat dolphin but he was too heavy and old and very soon gave up and presently i was driving through the drizzle of the dying day with the windshield wipers in full action but unable to cope with my tears  leaving as i did coalmont around four in the afternoon by route x—i do not remember the number i might have made ramsdale by dawn had not a shortcut tempte d me i had to get onto highway y my map showed quite blandly that just beyond woodbine which i reached at nightfall i could leave paved x and reach paved y by means of a transverse dirt road it was only some forty miles long according to my map otherwise i would have to follow x for another hundred miles and then use leisurely looping z to get to y and my destination however  the shortcut in question got worse and worse bumpier and bumpier  muddier and muddier  and when i attempted to turn back after some ten miles of purblind tortuous and tortoiseslow progress my old and weak melmoth got stuck in deep clay all was dark and muggy  and hopeless my headlights hung over a broad ditch full of water  the surrounding country  if any was a black wilderness i sought to extricate myself but my rear wheels only whined in slosh and anguish cursin g my plight i took off my fancy clothes changed into slacks pulled on the bulletriddled sweater and waded four miles back to a roadside farm it started to rain on the way but i had not the strength to go back for a mackintosh such incidents have convinced me that my heart is basically sound despite recent diagnoses around midnight a wrecker dragged my car out i navigated back to highway x and traveled on utter weariness overto ok me an hour later in an anonymous little town i pulled up at the curb and in darkness drank deep from a friendly flask the rain had been cancelled miles before it was a black warm night somewhere in appalachia now and then cars passed me red taillights receding white headlights advancing but the town was dead nobody strolled and laughed on the sidewalks as relaxing burghers would in sweet mellow  rotting europe i was alone to enjoy the innocent night and my terrible thoughts  a wire recept acle on the curb was very particular about

was not yet the last let me dally a little he is as good as destroyed some way further across the stree t neon lights flickered twice slower than my heart the outline of a restaurant sign a large coffeep ot kept bursting every full second or so into emerald life and every time it went out pink letters saying fine foods relayed it but the pot could still be made out as a latent shadow teasing the eye before its next emerald resurrection we made shadowgraphs this furtive burg was not far from the enchanted hunters i was weeping again drunk on the impossible past  at this solitary stop for refres hments between coalmont and ramsdale between innocent dolly schill er and jovial uncle ivor i reviewed my case with the utmost simplicity and clarity i now saw myself and my love previous attemp ts seemed out of focus in comparison a couple of years before under the guidance of an intelligent frenchspeaking confessor  to whom in a moment of meta physical curiosity  i had turned over a protestant’ s drab atheism for an oldfashioned popish cure i had hoped to deduce from my sense of sin the existence of a supreme being on those frosty mornings in rimelaced quebec the good priest worked on me with the fines t tender ness and understanding i am infinitely obliged to him and the great institution he represented alas i was unable to transcend the simple human fact that whatever spiritual solace i might find whatever lithophanic eternities might be provided for me nothing could make my lolita for get the foul lust i had inflicted upon her  unless it can be proven to me—to me as i am now today  with my heart and my beard and my putrefaction—that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a north american girlc hild named dolores haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac unless this can be proven and if it can then life is a joke i see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art to quote an old poet the moral sense in mortals is the duty we have to pay on mortal sense of beauty    there was the day during our first trip—our first circle of paradise—when in order to enjoy my phantasms in peace i firmly decided to ignore what i could not help perceiving the fact that i was to her not a boy friend not a glamour man not a pal not even a person at all but just two eyes and a foot of engorged brawn—to mention only mentionable matters there was the day when havin g withdrawn the functional promise i had made her on the eve whatever she had set her funny little heart on—a roller rink with some special plastic floor or a movie matinee to which she wanted to go alone i happened to glimpse from the bathroom through a chance combination of mirror aslant and door ajar a look on her face … that look i cannot exactly describe … an expression of helplessness so perfect that it seemed to grade into one of rather comfortable inanity just because this was the very limit of injustice and frustration—and every limit presupposes something beyond it —hence the neutral illumination and when you bear in mind that these were the raised eyebrows and parted lips of a child you may better appreciate what depths of calculated carnality  what reflected despair  restrained me from falling at her dear feet and dissolving in human tears and sacrificing my jealousy to whatever pleasure lolita might hope to derive from mixing with dirty and dangerous children in an outside world that was real to her  and i have still other smothered memories now unfolding themselves into limbless monsters of pain once in a sunsetending street of beardsley  she turned to little eva rosen i was taking both nymphets to a concert and walking behind them so close as almost to touch them with my person she turned to eva and so very serenely and seriously  in answer to something the other had said about its being better to die than hear milton pinski some local schoolboy she knew  talk about music my lolita remarked “you know what’s so dreadful about dying is that you are completely on your own” and it struck me as my automaton knees went up and down that i simply did not know a thing about my darling’ s mind and that quite possibly  behind the awful juvenile clichés there was in her a garden and atwilight and a palace gate—dim and adorable regions which happened to be lucid ly and absolutely forbidden to me in my pollute d rags and miserable convulsions for i often noticed that living as we did she and i in a world of total evil we would become strangely embarrassed whenever i tried to discuss something she and an older friend she and a parent she and a real healthy sweetheart i and annabel lolita and a sublime purified analyzed deified harold haze might have discussed—an abstract idea a painting stippled hopkin s or shorn baudelaire god or shakespeare anything of a genuine kind good will she would mail her vulnerability in trite brashness and boredom whereas i using for my desperate ly detached comments an artificial tone of voice that set my own last teeth on edge provoked my audience to such outbursts of rudeness as made any further conversation impossible oh my poor  bruised child i loved you i was a pentapod monster  but i loved you i was despicable and brutal and turpid and everything mais je t’aimais je t’aimais and there were times when i knew how you felt and it was hell to know it my little one lolita girl brave dolly schiller  i recall certain moments let us call them iceber gs in paradise when after having had my fill of her—after fabulous insane exertions that left me limp and azurebarred—i would gather her in my arms with at last a mute moan of human tenderness her skin glistening in the neon light coming from the paved court through the slits in the blind her sootblack lashes matted her grave gray eyes more vacant than ever—for all the world a little patient still in the confusion of a drug after a major operation—and the tenderness would deepen to shame and despair and i would lull and rock my lone light lolita in my marble arms and moan in her warm hair and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing and at the peak of this human agonized selfless tenderness with my soul actually hanging around her naked body and ready to repent all at once ironically  horribly  lust would swell again—and “oh no” lolita would say with a sigh to heaven and the next moment the tenderness and the azure—all would be shattered midtwentieth century ideas concerning childparent relationship have been considerably tainted by the scholastic rigmarole and standardized symbols of the psychoanalytic racket but i hope i am addressing myself to unbiased readers once when avis’s father had honked outside to signal papa had come to take his pet home i felt obliged to invite him into the parlor  and he sat down for a minute and while we conversed avis aheavy  unattract ive affectionat e child drew up to him and eventually perched plumply on his knee now i do not remember if i have mentioned that lolita always had an absolu tely enchanting smile for strangers a tender furry slitting of the eyes a dreamy sweet radiance of all her features which did not mean a thing of course but was so beautiful so endear ing that one found it hard to reduce such sweetness to but a magic gene automatically lighting up her face in atavistic token of some ancient rite of welcome— hospitable prostitution the coarse reader may say well there she stood while mr  byrd twirled his hat and talked and—yes look how stupid of me i have left out the main characteristic of the famous lolita smile namely  while the tender  nectared dimpled brightness played it was never directed at the stranger in the room but hung in its own remote flowered void so to speak or wandered with myopi c softness over chance objects—and this is what was happening now while fat avis sidled up to her papa lolita gently beamed at a fruit knife that she fingered on the edge of the table whereon she leaned many miles away from me suddenly  as avis clung to her father ’s neck and ear while with a casual arm the man enveloped his lumpy and large offspring i saw lolita’ s smile lose all its light and become a frozen little shadow of itself and the fruit knife slipped off the table and struck her with its silver handle a freak blow on the ankle which made her gasp and crouc h head forward and then jumping on one leg her face awful with the preparatory grimace which children hold till the tears gush she was gone— to be followed at once and consoled in the kitchen by avis who had such a wonderful fat pink dad and a small chubby brother  and a brandnew baby sister  and a home and two grinning dogs and lolita had nothing and i have a neat pendant to that little scene—also in a beardsley setting lolita who had been reading near the fire stretched herself and then inquired her elbow up with a grunt “where is she buried anyway” “who” “oh you know  my murdered mummy ” “and you know where her grave is” i said controlling myself whereupon i named the cemetery—just outside ramsdale between the railway tracks and lakeview hill “moreover ” i added “the tragedy of such an accident is somewhat cheapened by the epithet you saw fit to apply to it if you really wish to triumph in your mind over the idea of death—” “ray ” said lo for hurray  and languidly left the room and for a long while i stared with smarting eyes into the fire then i picked up her book it was some trash for young people there was a gloomy girl marion and there was her stepmother whoturned out to be against all expectations a young gay understanding redhead who explained to marion that marion’ s dead mother had really been a heroic woman since she had deliberately dissimulated her great love for marion because she was dying and did not want her child to miss her i did not rush up to her room with cries i always preferred the mental hygiene of noninterference now squirming and pleading with my own memory  i recall that on this and similar occasions it was always my habit and method to ignore lolita’ s states of mind while comforting my own base self when my mother  in a livid wet dress under the tumbling mist so i vividly imagined her had run panting ecstatically up that ridge above moulinet to be felled there by a thunderbolt i was but an infant and in retrospect no yearnings of the accepted kind could i ever graft upon any moment of my youth no matter how savagely psychotherapists heckled me in my later periods of depressio n but i admit that a man of my power of imagination cannot plead personal ignorance of universal emot ions i may also have relied too much on the abnormally chill relations between charlotte and her daughter  but the awful point of the whole argument is this it had become gradually clear to my conventional lolita during our singular and bestial cohabitatio n that even the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest which in the long run was the best i could of fer the waif  ramsdale revisi ted i approached it from the side of the lake the sunny noon was all eyes as i rode by in my mudflecked car i could distinguish scintillas of diamond water betw een the far pines i turned into the cemetery and walked among the long and short stone monuments bonzhur  charlotte on some of the grave s there were pale transparent little national flags slumped in the windless air under the evergreens gee ed that was bad luck—referring to g edward grammar  a thirtyfiveyear old new york office manager who had just been arrayed on a charge of murdering his thirtythreeyear old wife dorothy  bidding for the perfec t crime ed had bludgeoned his wife and put her into a car the case came to light when two county policemen on patrol saw mrs grammar ’s new big blue chrysler  an anniversary present from her husband speeding crazily down a hill just inside their jurisdiction god bless our good cops the car sideswiped a pole ran up an embankment covered with beard grass wild strawberry and cinquefoil and overturned the wheels were still gently spinning in the mellow sunlight when the officers removed mrs g’s body  it appea red to be a routine highway accident at first alas the woman’ s battered body did not match up with only minor damage suffered by the car i did better  i rolled on it was funny to see again the slender white churc h and the enormous elms forgetting that in an american suburban street a lone pedestrian is more conspicuous than a lone motorist i left the car in the avenue to walk unobtrusively past  lawn street befor e the great bloodshed i was entitled to a little relief to a cathartic spasm of mental regur gitation closed were the white shutters of the junk mansion and somebody had attached a found black velvet hair ribbon to the white for sale sign which was leaning toward the sidewalk no dog barked no gardener telepho ned no miss opposite sat on the vined porch —where to the lone pedestrian’ s annoyance two ponytailed young women in identical polkadotted pinafores stopped doing whatever they were doing to stare athim she was long dead no doubt these might be her twin nieces from philadelphia should i enter my old house as in a turgenev story  a torrent of italian music came from an open windo w—that of the living room what romantic soul was playing the piano wher e no piano had plunged and plashed on that bewitched sunday with the sun on her beloved legs all at once i noticed that from the lawn i had mown a goldenskinned brownhaired nymphet of nine or ten in white shorts was looking at me with wild fascin ation in her large blueblack eyes i said something pleasant to her meanin g no harm an oldworld compliment what nice eyes you have but she retreated in haste and the music stopped abruptly  and a violentlooking dark man glistening with sweat came out and glared at me i was on the point of identifying myself when with a pang of dreamembarrassment i became aware of my mudcaked dungar ees my filthy and torn sweater  my bristly chin my bum’ s bloodshot eyes without saying a word i turned and plodded back the way i had come an asterlike anemic flower grew out of a remembered chink in the sidewalk quietly resurrected miss opposite was being wheeled out by her nieces onto her porch as if it were a stage and i the star performer  prayin g she would not call to me i hurried to my car what a steep little street what a profound avenue a red ticket showed between wiper and windshield  i carefully tore it into two four eight pieces feeling i was losing my time i drove energetically to the downtown hotel where i had arrived with a new bag more than five years before i took a room made two appointments by telephone shaved bathed put on black clothes and went down for a drink in the bar nothing had changed the barroom was suffused with the same dim impossible garnetred light that in europe years ago went with low haunts but here meant a bit of atmosphere in a family hotel i sat at the same little table where at the very start of my stay immediate ly after becoming charlotte’ s lodger  i had thought fit to celebrate the occasion by suavely sharing with her half a bottle of champagne which had fatally conquered her poor brimming heart as then a moonfaced waiter was arrangi ng with stellar care fifty sherries on a round tray for a weddi ng party  murphyfantasia this time it was eight minutes to three as i walked through the lobby  i had to skirt a group of ladies who with mille grâces were taking leave of each other after a luncheon party  with a harsh cry of recognition  one pounced upon me she was a stoutshort woman in pearlgray  with a long gray slim plume to her small hat it was mrs chatfield she attacke d me with a fake smile all aglow with evil curiosity  had i done to dolly  perhaps what frank lasalle a fiftyyear old mechanic had done to eleveny earold sally horner in  very soon i had that avid glee well under control she thought i was in california how was— with exquisite pleasure i informed her that my stepdaughter had just married a brilliant young mining engineer with a hushhush job in the northwest she said she disapp roved of such early marriages she would never let her phyllis who was now eighteen— “oh yes of course” i said quietly  “i remember phyllis phyllis and camp q yes of course by the way did she ever tell you how charlie holmes debauched there his mother ’s little char ges” mrs chatfield’ s already broken smile now disintegrated completely  “for shame” she cried “for shame mr humbert the poor boy has just been killed in korea” i said didn’ t she think “vient de” with the infin itive expressed recent events so much more neatly than the english “just” with the past but i had to be trotting of f i said there were only two blocks to windmuller ’s office he greeted me with a very slow very enveloping strong searching grip he thoug ht i was in california had i not lived at one time at beardsley his daughter had just entered beards ley college and how was— i gave all necessary information about mrs schiller  we had a pleasant business conference i walked out into the hot september sunshine a contented pauper  now that everyt hing had been put out of the way i could dedicate myself freely to the main object of my visit to ramsdale in the methodical manner on whic h i have always prided myself i had been keeping clare quilty’ s face masked in my dark dunge on where he was waiting for me to come with barber and priest “réveillezvous laqueue il est temps de mourir ” i have no time right now to discu ss the mnemonics of physiognomization—i am on my way to his uncle and walking fast—but let me jot down this i had preserved in the alcohol of a clouded memory the toad of a face in the course of a few glimpses i had noticed its slight resemblance to a cheery and rather repuls ive wine dealer  a relative of mine in switzerland with his dumbbells and stinking tricot and fat hairy arms and bald patch and pig faced servantconcubine he was on the whole a harmless old rascal too harmless in fact to be confused with my prey in the state of mind i nowfound myself i had lost contact with trapp’ s image it had become completely engulfed by the face of clare quilty—as represented with artistic precision by an easeled photograph of him that stood on his uncle’ s desk in beardsley  at the hands of charming dr molnar  i had under gone a rather serious dental operation retaining only a few upper and lower front teeth the substitutes were dependent on a system of plates with an inconspicuous wire affair running along my upper gums the whole arrangement was a masterpiece of comfort and my canines were in perfect health howeve r to garnish my secret purpose with a plausib le pretext i told dr quilty that in hope of alleviating facial neuralgia i had decided to have all my teeth removed what would a complete set of dentures cost how long would the process take assuming we fixed our first appointment for some time in november where was his famous nephew now would it be possible to have them all out in one dramatic session a whitesmocked grayhaired man with a crew cut and the big flat cheeks of a politician dr quilty perched on the corner of his desk one foot dreamily and seductively rockin g as he launched on a glorious longrange plan he would first provide me with provisional plates until the gums settled then he would make me a permanent set he would like to have a look at that mouth of mine he wore perforated pied shoes he had not visited with the rascal since  but supposed he could be found at his ancestral home grimm road not far from parkington it was a noble dream his foot rocked his gaze was inspired it would cost me around six hundred he suggested he take measurements right away  and make the first set before starting operations my mouth was to him a splendid cave full of priceless treasures but i denied him entrance “no” i said “on second thoughts i shall have it all done by dr molnar  his price is higher  but he is of course a much better dentist than you” i do not know if any of my readers will ever have a chance to say that it is a delicious dream feeling clare’ s uncle remained sitting on the desk still looking dreamy  but his foot had stopped pushrocking the cradle of rosy anticipation on the other hand his nurse a skeletonthin faded girl with the tragic eyes of unsuccessful blondes rushed after me so as to be able to slam the door in my wake push the magazine into the butt press home until you hear or feel the magazine catch engage delightfully snug capacity eight cartridges fullblued aching to be dischar ged  a gas station attendant in parkington explained to me very clearly how to get to grimm road wishing to be sure quilty would be at home i attempted to ring him up but learned that his private telephone had recently been disconnect ed did that mean he was gone i started to drive to grimm road twelve miles north of the town by that time night had eliminated most of the landscape and as i followed the narrow winding highway  a series of short posts ghostly white with reflectors borrowed my own lights to indicate this or that curve i could make out a dark valley on one side of the road and wooded slopes on the other  and in front of me like derelict snowflakes moths drifted out of the blackness into my probing aura at the twelfth mile as foretold a curiously hooded bridge sheathed me for a moment and beyond it a whitewashed rock loomed on the right and a few car lengths further  on the same side i turned off the highway up gravelly grimm road for a couple of minutes all was dank dark dense forest then pavor manor a wooden house with a turret arose in a circular clearing its windows glowed yellow and red its drive was cluttered with half a dozen cars i stopped in the shelter of the trees and abolished my lights to ponder the next move quietly  he would be surroun ded by his henchmen and whores i could not help seeing the inside of that festive and ramshackle castle in terms of “troubled teens” a story in one of her magazines vague “orgies” a sinister adult with penele cigar  drugs bodyguards at least he was there i would return in the torpid morning gently i rolled back to town in that old faithful car of mine which was serenely  almost cheerfully working for me my lolita there was still a threeyear old bobby pin of hers in the depths of the glove compartment there was still that stream of pale moths siphoned out of the night by my headlights dark barns still propped themselves up here and there by the roadside people were still going to the movies while searchi ng for night lodgings i passed a drivein in a selenian glow  truly mystical in its contrast with the moonless and massive night on a gigantic screen slanting away among dark drowsy fields a thin phantom raised a gun both he andhis arm reduced to tremulous dish water by the oblique angle of that receding world —and the next moment a row of trees shut off the gesticulation  i left insomnia lodge next morning around eight and spent some time in parkington visions of bungling the execution kept obsessing me thinking that perhaps the cartridges in the automatic had gone stale during a week of inactivity  i removed them and inserted a fresh batch such a thorough oil bath did i give chum that now i could not get rid of the stuff i bandaged him up with a rag like a maimed limb and used another rag to wrap up a handful of spare bullets a thunderstorm accompanied me most of the way back to grimm road but when i reached pavor mano r the sun was visible again burning like a man and the birds screamed in the drenched and steaming trees the elaborate and decrepit house seemed to stand in a kind of daze reflecting as it were my own state for i could not help realizing as my feet touched the springy and insecure ground that i had overdone the alcoholic stimulation business a guardedly ironic silence answ ered my bell the garage however was loaded with his car a black convertible for the nonce i tried the knocker  renobody  with a petulant snarl i pushed the front door—and how nice it swung open as in a medieval fairy tale having softly closed it behind me i made my way across a spacious and very ugly hall peered into an adjacent drawing room noticed a numbe r of used glasses growing out of the carpet decided that master was still asleep in the master bedroom so i trudged upstairs my right hand clutched muffled chum in my pocket my left patted the sticky banisters of the three bedrooms i inspected one had obviously been slept in that night there was a library full of flowers there was a rather bare room with ample and deep mirrors and a polar bear skin on the slippery floor  there were still other rooms a happy thought struck me if and when master returned from his constitutional in the woods or emer ged from some secret lair it might be wise for an unsteady gunman with a long job before him to prevent his playmate from locking himself up in a room consequently  for at least five minutes i went about—lucidly insane crazily calm an enchanted and verytight hunter—tu rning whatever keys in whatever locks there were and pocketing them with my free left hand the house being an old one had more planned privacy than have modern glamour boxes where the bathroom the only lockable locus has to be used for the furtive needs of planned parenthood speaking of bathrooms—i was about to visit a third one when master came out of it leaving a brief waterfall behind him the corner of a passage did not quite conceal me grayfaced baggyeyed fluffily disheveled in a scanty balding way but still perfectly recognizable he swept by me in a purple bathrobe very like one i had he either did not notice me or else dismissed me as some familiar and innocuous hallucination—and showing me his hairy calves he proceeded sleepwalker wise downstairs  i pocketed my last key and followed him into the entrance hall he had half opened his mouth and the front door to peer out through a sunny chink as one who thinks he has heard a halfhearted visitor ring and recede then still ignoring the raincoated phantasm that had stopped in midstairs master walked into a cozy boudoir across the hall from the drawing room through which—taking it easy knowing he was safe—i now went away from him and in a baradorned kitchen gingerly unwrapped dirty chum taking care not to leave any oil stains on the chrome—i think i got the wrong product it was black and awfully messy  in my usual meticulous way i transferred naked chum to a clean recess about me and made for the little boudoir  my step as i say was springy—too springy perhaps for success but my heart pounded with tiger joy  and i crunched a cocktail glass underfoot master met me in the oriental parlor  “now who are you” he asked in a high hoarse voice his hands thrust into his dressing gown pockets his eyes fixing a point to the northeast of my head “are you by any chance brewster” by now it was evident to everybody that he was in a fog and completely at my socalled mercy  i could enjoy myself “that’ s right” i answered suavely  “je suis monsieur brustèr e let us chat for a moment before we start” he looked pleased his smud gy mustache twitched i removed my raincoat i was wearing a black suit a black shirt no tie we sat down in two easy chairs “you know” he said scratching loudly his fleshy and gritty gray cheek and show ing his small pearly teeth in a crooked grin “you don’t look likejack brewster  i mean the resemblance is not particularly striking somebody told me he had a brother with the same telephone company ” to have him trapped after those years of repentance and rage … to look at the black hairs on the back of his pudgy hands … to wander with a hundred eyes over his purple silks and hirsute chest foreglimpsing the punctures and mess and music of pain … to know that this semi animated subhuman trickster who had sodomized my darling—oh my darling this was intolerable bliss “no i am afraid i am neither of the brewsters” he cocked his head looking more pleased than ever  “guess again punch” “ah” said punch “so you have not come to bother me about those long distance calls” “you do make them once in a while don’ t you” “excuse me” i said i had said i thought he had said he had never— “people” he said “people in general i’m not accusing you brewster  but you know it’s absurd the way people invade this damned house without even knocking they use the vaterr e they use the kitchen they use the telephone phil calls philadelphia pat calls patagonia i refuse to pay you have a funny accent captain” “quilty ” i said “do you recall a little girl called dolores haze dolly haze dolly called dolores colo” “sure she may have made those calls sure any place paradise wash hell canyon who cares” “i do quilty  you see i am her father ” “nonsense” he said “y ou are not y ou are some foreign literary agent a frenchman once translated my proud flesh as la fierté de la chair  absurd” “she was my child quilty ” in the state he was in he could not really be taken aback by anything but his blustering manner was not quite convincing a sort of wary inkling kindled his eyes into a semblance of life they were immediately dulled again “i’m very fond of children myself” he said “and fathers are among my best friends”he turned his head away  looking for something he beat his pockets he attempted to rise from his seat “down” i said—apparently much louder than i intended “you need not roar at me” he complained in his strange feminine manner  “i just wanted a smoke i’m dying for a smoke” “you’re dying anyway ” “oh chucks” he said “you begin to bore me what do you want are you french mister woollywoobooare let’s go to the barroomette and have a stif f—” he saw the little dark weapon lying in my palm as if i were offering it to him “say” he drawled now imitatin g the underworld numbskull of movies “that’ s a swell little gun you’ve got there what d’you want for her” i slappe d down his outstretched hand and he managed to knock over a box on a low table near him it ejected a handful of cigarettes “here they are” he said cheerfully  “you recall kipling une femme est une femme mais un caporal est une cigar ette now we need matches” “quilty ” i said “i want you to concentrate you are going to die in a moment the hereafter for all we know may be an eternal state of excruciating insanity  you smoked your last cigarette yesterday  concentrate t ry to understand what is happening to you” he kept taking the drome cigarette apart and munching bits of it “i am willing to try” he said “you are either australian or a german refugee must you talk to me this is a gentile’s house you know  maybe you’d better run along and do stop demonstrating that gun i’ve an old sternluger in the music room” i pointed chum at his slippered foot and crushed the trigger  it clicked he looked at his foot at the pistol again at his foot i made another awful effort and with a ridiculously feeble and juvenile sound it went off the bullet entered the thick pink rug and i had the paralyzing impression that it had merely trickled in and might come out again “see what i mean” said quilty  “you should be a little more careful give me that thing for christ’ s sake” he reached for it i pushed him back into the chair  the rich joy was waning it was high time i destroyed him but he must underst and why he was being destroyed his condition infected me the weapon felt limp and clumsy in my hand“concentrate” i said “on the thought of dolly haze whom you kidnaped —” “i did not” he cried “you’re all wet i saved her from a beastly pervert show me your badge instead of shooting at my foot you ape you where is that badge i’m not responsible for the rapes of others absurd that joy ride i grant you was a silly stunt but you got her back didn’ t you come let’s have a drink” i asked him whether he wanted to be executed sitting or standing “ah let me think” he said “it is not an easy question incidentally—i made a mistake which i sincer ely regret you see i had no fun with your dolly  i am practically impotent to tell the melancholy truth and i gave her a splendid vacation she met some remarkable people do you happen to know—” and with a tremendous lurch he fell all over me sending the pistol hurtling under a chest of drawers fortunately he was more impetuous than vigorous and i had little dif ficulty in shoving him back into his chair  he puf fed a little and folded his arms on his chest “now you’ve done it” he said “vous voilà dans de beaux draps mon vieux ” his french was improving i looked around perhaps if—pe rhaps i could—on my hands and knees risk it “alors que faiton” he asked watching me closely  i stooped he did not move i stooped lower  “my dear sir” he said “stop trifling with life and death i am a playwright i have written tragedies comedies fantasies i have made private movies out of justine and other eighteenthcentury sexcapades i’m the author of fiftytwo successful scenarios i know all the ropes let me handle this there should be a poker somewhere why don’t i fetch it and then we’ll fish out your property ” fussily  busybo dily cunningly  he had risen again while he talked i groped under the chest trying at the same time to keep an eye on him all of a sudden i noticed that he had noticed that i did not seem to have noticed chum protruding from beneath the other corner of the chest we fell to wrestling again we rolled all over the floor  in each other ’s arms like two huge helpless children he was naked and goatish under his robe and i feltsuffocated as he rolled over me i rolled over him we rolled over me they rolled over him w e rolled over

formless tussle on the part of two literati one of whom was utterly disor ganized by a drug while the other was handicapped by a heart conditi on and too much gin when at last i had possessed myself of my precious weapon and the scenario writer had been reinstalled in his low chair  both of us were panting as the cowm an and the sheepman never do after their battle i decide d to inspect the pistol— our sweat might have spoiled something —and regain my wind before proceeding to the main item in the program to fill in the pause i proposed he read his own sentence—in the poetical form i had given it the term “poetical justice” is one that may be most happily used in this respect i handed him a neat typescript “yes” he said “splendid idea let me fetch my reading glasses” he attempted to rise “no” “just as you say  shall i read out loud” “yes” “here goes i see it’ s in verse because you took advantage of a sinner because you took advantage because you took because you took advantage of my disadvantage … that’ s good you know  that’ s damned good” … when i stood adamnaked before a federal law and all its stinging stars “oh grand stuf f” … because you took advantage of a sinwhen i

asked him if he had anything serious to say before dying the automatic was again ready for use on the person he looked at it and heaved a big sigh “now look here mac” he said “you are drunk and i am a

skies—drop that gun —and moreover i can arrange for you to attend executions not everybody knows that the chair is painted yellow—” feu this time i hit something hard i hit the back of a black rocking chair  not unlike dolly schiller ’s—my bullet hit the inside surface of its back whereupon it immediately went into a rocking act so fast and with such zest that any one coming into the room might have been flabber gasted by the double miracle that chair rocking in a panic all by itself and the armchair  where my purple target had just been now void of all live content wigglin g his fingers in the air with a rapid heave of his rump he flashed into the music room and the next second we were tugging and gasping on both sides of the door which had a key i had overlo oked i won again and with another abrupt movement clare the impredictable sat down before the piano and played several atrociously vigorous fundamentally hysterical plangent chords his jowls quivering his spread hands tensely plunging and his nostrils emitt ing the soundtrack snorts which had been absent from our fight still singing those impossible sonorities he made a futile attempt to open with his foot a kind of seaman’ s chest near the piano my next bullet caught him somewhere in the side and he rose from his chair higher and higher  like old gray mad nijinski like old faithful like some old nightmare of mine to a phenomenal altitude or so it seemed as he rent the air— still shaking with the rich black music—head thrown back in a howl hand pressed to his brow and with his other hand clutching his armpit as if stung by a hornet down he came on his heels and again a normal robed man scurried out into the hall i see myself following him through the hall with a kind of double triple kangaroo jump remaining quite straight on straight legs while bouncing up twice in his wake and then bouncing between him and the front door in a balletlike stiff bounce with the purpose of heading him off since the door was not properly closed suddenly dignified and somew hat morose he started to walk up the broad stairs and shifting my position but not actually following him up the steps i fired three or four times in quick succession wounding him at every blaze and every time i did it to him that horrible thing to him his facewould twitch in an absurd clownish manner  as if he were exaggerating the pain he slowed down rolled his eyes half closing them and made a feminine “ah” and he shivered every time a bullet hit him as i if i were tickling him and every time i got him with those slow clumsy  blind bullets of mine he would say under his breath with a phoney british accent—all the while dreadfully twitching shivering smirking but withal talking in a curiously detach ed and even amiable manner “ah that hurts sir enough ah that hurts atrociously  my dear fellow  i pray you desist ah—very painful very painful indeed … god hah this is abominable you should really not—” his voice trailed off as he reached the landing but he steadily walked on despite all the lead i had lodged in his bloated body—and in distress in dismay  i understood that far from killing him i was injecting spurts of energy into the poor fellow  as if the bullets had been capsules wherein a heady elixir danced i reloaded the thing with hands that were black and blood y—i had touched something he had anointed with his thick gore then i rejoined him upstairs the keys jangling in my pockets like gold he was trudging from room to room bleeding majestically  trying to find an open window  shaking his head and still trying to talk me out of murder  i took aim at his head and he retired to the master bedroom with a burst of royal purple where his ear had been “get out get out of here” he said coughing and spitting and in a nightmare of wonder  i saw this bloodspattered but still buoyant person get into his bed and wrap himself up in the chaotic bedclothes i hit him at very close range through the blankets and then he lay back and a big pink bubble with juvenile connotatio ns formed on his lips grew to the size of a toy balloon and vanished i may have lost contact with reality for a second or two—oh nothing of the ijustblackedout sort that your common criminal enacts on the contrary  i want to stress the fact that i was responsible for every shed drop of his bubbleblood but a kind of momentary shift occurred as if i were in the connubial bedroom and charlotte were sick in bed quilty was a very sick man i held one of his slippers instead of the pistol—i was sitting on the pistol then i made myself a little more comfortable in the chair near the bed and consulted my wrist watch the crystal was gone but it ticked the whole sad business had taken more than an hour he was quiet at last far from feeling any relief a burden even weightier than the one i hadhoped to get rid of was with me upon me over me i could not bring myself to touch him in order to make sure he was really dead he looked it a quarte r of his face gone and two flies beside themselves with a dawning sense of unbelie vable luck my hands were hardly in better condition than his i washed up as best i could in the adjacent bathroom now i could leave as i emer ged on the landing i was amazed to discover that a vivacious buzz i had just been dismissing as a mere singing in my ears was really a medley of voices and radio music coming from the downstairs drawing room i found there a number of people who apparently had just arrived and were cheerfully drinking quilty ’s liquor  there was a fat man in an easy chair and two darkhaired pale young beauties sisters no doubt big one and small one almost a child demurely sat side by side on a davenport a floridfaced fellow with sapphireblue eyes was in the act of bringing two glasses out of the barlike kitchen where two or three women were chatting and chinking ice i stopped in the doorway and said “i have just killed clare quilty” “good for you” said the florid fellow as he offered one of the drinks to the elder girl “somebody ought to have done it long ago” remarked the fat man “what does he say tony” asked a faded blonde from the bar “he says” answered the florid fellow  “he has killed cue” “well” said another unidentified man rising in a corner where he had been crouching to inspect some recor ds “i guess we all should do it to him some day” “anyway ” said tony “he’d better come down we can’t wait for him much longer if we want to go to that game” “give this man a drink somebody ” said the fat person  “want a beer” said a woman in slacks showing it to me from afar  only the two girls on the davenport both wearing black the younger fingering a bright something about her white neck only they said nothing but just smiled on so young so lewd as the music paused for a moment there was a sudden noise on the stairs tony and i stepped out into the hall quilty of all people had managed to crawl out onto the landing and there we could see him flapping and heaving and then subsiding forever this time in a purple heap “hurry up cue” said tony with a laugh “i believe he’s still—” he returned to the drawing room music drowned the rest of the sentence this i said to myself was the end of the ingenious play staged for me by quilty  with a heavy heart i left the house and walked through the spottedblaze of the sun to my car two other cars were parked on both sides of it and i had some trouble squeezing out  the rest is a little flattish and faded slowly i drove downhill and presently found myself going at the same lazy pace in a direction opposite to parkington i had left my raincoat in the boudoir and chum in the bathroom no it was not a house i would have liked to live in i wondered idly if some surgeon of genius might not alter his own career  and perhaps the whole destiny of mankind by reviving quilted quilty  clare obscure not that i cared on the whole i wished to for get the whole mess—and when i did learn he was dead the only satisfaction it gave me was the relief of knowing i need not mentally accompany for months a painful and disgusting conv alescence interrupted by all kinds of unmentionable operations and relapses and perhaps an actual visit from him with trouble on my part to rationalize him as not being a ghost thomas had something it is strange that the tactile sense  which is so infinitely less precious to men than sight beco mes at critical moments our main if not only handle to reality  i was all covered with quilty—with the feel of that tumble before the bleeding the road now stretched across open country  and it occurred to me—not by way of prote st not as a symbol or anything like that but merely as a novel experience—that since i had disregarded all laws of humanity  i might as well disregard the rules of traffic so i crossed to the left side of the highway and checked the feeling and the feeling was good it was a pleasant diaphragmal melting with elements of diffused tactility all this enhanced by the thought that nothing could be nearer to the elimination of basic physical laws than deliberately driving on the wrong side of the road in a way it was a very spiritual itch gently  dreamily  not excee ding twenty miles an hour i drove on that queer mirror side traffic was light cars that now and then passed me on the side i had abandoned to them honked at me brutally  cars coming towards me wobbled swerved and cried out in fear presently i found myself approaching populated places passing through a red light was like a sip of forbidden burgundy when i was a child meanwhile complications were arising i was being followed and escortedthen in front of me i saw two cars placing themselves in such a manner as to completely block my way with a graceful movement i turned off the road and after two or three big bounces rode up a grassy slope among surprised cows and there i came to a gentle rocking stop a kind of thoughtful hegelian synthesis linking up two dead women i was soon to be taken out of the car hi melmoth thanks a lot old fellow—and was indeed looking forward to surrender myself to many hands without doing anything to cooperate while they moved and carried me relaxed comfortable surrendering myself lazily  like a patient and deriving an eerie enjoyment from my limpness and the absolutely reliable support given me by the police and the ambulance people and while i was waiting for them to run up to me on the high slope i evoked a last mirage of wond er and hopelessness one day soon after her disappearance an attack of abomi nable nausea forced me to pull up on the ghost of an old mountain road that now accomp anied now traversed a brand new highway  with its populati on of asters bathing in the detached warmth of a paleblue afternoon in late summer  after coughing myself inside out i rested a while on a boulder  and then thinking the sweet air might do me good walked a little way toward a low stone parapet on the precipice side of the highway  small grasshopp ers spurted out of the withered roadside weeds a very light cloud was opening its arms and moving toward a slightly more substantial one belonging to another  more sluggish heavenlogged system as i approached the friendly abyss i grew aware of a melodious unity of sounds rising like vapor from a small mining town that lay at my feet in a fold of the valley  one could make out the geometry of the streets between blocks of red and gray roofs and green puffs of trees and a serpentine stream and the rich orelike glitter of the city dump and beyond the town roads crisscrossi ng the crazy quilt of dark and pale fields and behind it all great timbered mountains but even brighter than those quietly rejoicing colors—for there are colors and shades that seem to enjoy themselves in good company—both brighter and dreamier to the ear than they were to the eye was that vapory vibration of accumulated sounds that neve r ceased for a mome nt as it rose to the lip of granite where i stood wiping my foul mouth and soon i realized that all these sounds were of one nature that no other sounds but these came from the streets of the transparent town with the women at home and the men away  reader what i heard was but the melody of children at play nothing but that and so limpid was the air thatwithin this vapor of blended voices majestic and minute remote and magically near frank and divinely enigmatic—one could hear now and then as if releas ed an almost articulate spurt of vivid laughter  or the crack of a bat or the clatter of a toy wagon but it was all really too far for the eye to distinguish any movement in the lightly etched streets i stood listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of demure murmur for background and then i knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not lolita’ s absence from my side but the absence of her voice from that concord this then is my story  i have reread it it has bits of marrow sticking to it and blood and beautiful bright green flies at this or that twist of it i feel my slipp ery self eluding me gliding into deeper and darker waters than i care to probe i have camoufla ged what i could so as not to hurt people and i have toyed with many pseudonyms for myself before i hit on a particularly apt one there are in my notes “otto otto” and “mesmer mesmer” and “lambert lambe rt” but for some reason i think my choice expresses the nastiness best when i started  fiftysix days ago to write lolita  first in the psychopathic ward for observation and then in this wellhe ated albeit tombal seclusio n i thought i would use these notes in toto at my trial to save not my head of course but my soul in midcomposition however  i realized that i could not parade living lolita i still may use parts of this memoir in hermetic sessions but publication is to be deferred for reasons that may appear more obvious than they really are i am opposed to capital punishment this attitude will be i trust shared by the sentencing judge had i come before myself i would have given humbert at least thirtyfive years for rape and dismissed the rest of the charges but even so dolly schiller will probably survive me by many years the following decisi on i make with all the legal impact and support of a signed testament i wish this mem oir to be publish ed only when lolita is no longer alive thus neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book but while the blood still throbs through my writing hand you are still as much part of blessed matter as i am and i can still talk to you from here to alaska be true to your dick do not let other fellows touch you do not talk to strangers i hope you will love your baby  i hope it will be a boy that husband of yours i hope will always treat you well because otherwise myspecter shall come at him like black smoke like a demented giant and pull him apart nerve by nerve and do not pity c q one had to choose between him and h h and one wanted h h to exist at least a couple of months longer  so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations i am thinking of aurochs and angels the secret of durable pigments prophetic sonnets the refuge of art and this is the only immortality you and i may share my lolitavladimir nabokovl o l i t a after doing my impersonation of suave john ray the character in lolita who pens the foreword any comments coming straight from me may strike one—may strike me in fact— as an impersonation of vladimir nabokov talking about his own book a few points however  have to be discussed and the autobiographic device may induce mimic and model to blend teachers of literature are apt to think up such problems as “what is the author ’s purpose ” or still worse “what is the guy trying to say” now  i happen to be the kind of author who in starting to work on a book has no other purpose than to get rid of that book and who when asked to explain its origin and growth has to rely on such ancient terms as interreaction of inspiration and combination—which i admit sounds like a conjurer explaining one trick by performing another  the first little throb of lolita went through me late in  or early in  in paris at a time when i was laid up with a sever e attack of intercostal neura lgia as far as i can recall the initial shiver of inspiration was somehow prompted by a newspaper story about an ape in the jardin des plantes who after months of coaxing by a scientist produced the first drawing ever charcoaled by an animal this sketch showed the bars of the poor creature’ s cage the impuls e record had no textual connect ion with the ensuing train of thought which resulted however  in a prototype of my present novel a short story some thirty pages long i wrote it in russian the language in which i had been writing novels since  the best of these are not translated into english and all are prohibited for political reasons in russia the man was a centra l european the anonymous nymphet was french and the loci were paris and provence i had him marry the little girl’s sick mother who soon died and after a thwarted attempt to take advantage of the orphan in a hotel room arthur for that was his name threw himself under the wheels of a truck i read the story one bluepapered wartime night to a group of friends—mark aldanov  two social revolutionaries and a woman doctor but i was not pleased with the thing and destroyed it sometime after moving to america in around  in ithaca upstat e new york the throbbing which had never quite ceased began to plague me again combination joined inspiration with fresh zest and involved me in a new treatment of the theme this time in english—the language of my first governess in st petersbur g circa  a miss rachel hom e the nymphet now with a dash of irish blood was really much the same lass and the basic marryingher mother idea also subsisted but otherwise the thing was new and had grown in secret the claws and wings of a novel the book developed slowly  with many interruptions and asides it had taken me some forty years to invent russia and western europe  and now i was faced by the task of inven ting america the obtaining of such local ingredients as would allow me to inject a modicum of average “reality” one of the few words which mean nothing without quotes into the brew of individual fancy  proved at fifty a much more difficult process than it had been in the europe of my youth when receptiveness and retention were at their automatic best other books intervened once or twice i was on the point of burning the unfinished draft and had carried my juanita dark as far as the shadow of the leaning incinerator on the innocent lawn when i was stopped by the thought that the ghost of the destroyed book would haunt my files for the rest of my life every summer my wife and i go butterfly hunting the specimens are deposited at scientific institutions such as the museum of comparative zoology at harvard or the cornell university collection the locality labels pinned under these butterflies will be a boon to some twentyfirstcentury scholar with a taste for recondite biography  it was at such of our headquarters as telluride colorado afton wyoming portal arizona and ashland orego n that lolita was energetically resumed in the evenings or on cloudy days i finished copyi ng the thing out in longhand in the spring of  and at once began casting around for a publisher  at first on the advice of a wary old friend i was meek enough to stipulate that the book be brough t out anonymously  i doubt that i shall ever regret that soon afterwards realizing how likely a mask was to betray my own cause i decided to sign lolita  the four american publishers w x y z who in turn were offered the typescript and had their readers glance at it were shocked by lolita to a degree that even my wary old friend fp had not expectedwhile it is true that in ancien t europe and well into the eighteenth century obvious examples come from france deliberate lewdness was not inconsistent with flashes of comedy or vigorous satire or even the verve of a fine poet in a wanton mood it is also true that in modern times the term “pornography” connotes mediocrity  commercialism and certain strict rules of narration obscenity must be mated with banality because every kind of aesthetic enjoym ent has to be entirely replaced by simple sexual stimulation which demands the traditional word for direct action upon the patient old rigid rules must be followed by the pornographer in order to have his patient feel the same security of satisfaction as for examp le fans of detective stories feel—stories where if you do not watch out the real murderer may turn out to be to the fan’s disgust artistic origi nality who for instance would want a detective story without a single dialogue in it thus in pornographic novels action has to be limited to the copulation of clichés style structure imagery should never distract the reader from his tepid lust the novel must consist of an alternation of sexual scenes the passages in between must be reduced to sutures of sense logical bridges of the simp lest design brief expositions and explanations which the reader will probably skip but must know they exist in order not to feel cheated a mentality stemm ing from the routine of “true” fairy tales in childhood moreover  the sexual scenes in the book must follow a crescendo line with new variations new combinatio ns new sexes and a steady increase in the number of participants in a sade play they call the gardener in and therefore the end of the book must be more replete with lewd lore than the first chapters certain techniqu es in the begin ning of lolita humbert’ s journal for example misled some of my first readers into assuming that this was going to be a lewd book they expected the rising succession of erotic scenes when these stopped the readers stopped too and felt bored and let down this i suspect is one of the reasons why not all the four firms read the typescript to the end whether they found it pornographic or not did not interest me their refusal to buy the book was based not on my treatment of the them e but on the theme itself for there are at least three themes which are utterly taboo as far as most american publishers are concern ed the two others are a negrowhite marriage which is a complete and glorious success resulting in lots of children and grandchildren and the total atheist who lives a happy and useful life and dies in his sleep at the age of some of the reactions were very amusing one reader suggested that his firm might consider publication if i turned my lolita into a twelveyear old lad and had him seduced by humbert a farmer  in a barn amids t gaunt and arid surrounding s all this set forth in short strong “realistic ” sentences “he acts crazy  we all act crazy  i guess i guess god acts crazy ” etc although every body should know that i detest symbols and allegories which is due partly to my old feud with freudian voodooism and partly to my loathing of generalizations devised by literary mythists and sociologists an otherwise intelligent reader who flipped through the first part described lolita as “old europe debauching young america” while another flipper saw in it “young america debauching old europe” publisher x whose advisers got so bored with humbert that they never got beyond here had the naïve té to write me that part two was too long publisher y on the other hand regretted there were no good people in the book publisher z said if he printed lolita  he and i would go to jail no writer in a free country should be expected to bother about the exact demarcation between the sensuous and the sensual this is preposterous i can only admire but cannot emulate the accuracy of judgment of those who pose the fair young mammals photographed in magazines where the general neckline is just low enough to provoke a past master ’s chuckle and just high enough not to make a postmaster frown i presume there exist readers who find titillating the display of mural words in those hopelessly banal and enormous novels which are typed out by the thumbs of tense mediocrities and called “powerful” and “stark” by the reviewing hack ther e are gentle souls who would pronounce lolita meaningless because it does not teach them anything i am neither a reader nor a writer of didactic fiction and despite john ray’ s assertion lolita has no moral in tow for me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what i shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere connected with other states of being where art curi osity  tenderness kindness ecstasy is the norm there are not many such books all the rest is either topical trash or what some call the literature of ideas which very often is topical trash coming in huge blocks of plaster that are carefully transmitted from age to age until somebody comes along with a hammer and takes a good crack at balzac at gorki at mann another charge which some readers have made is that lolita is anti american this is something that pains me considerably more than theidiotic accusation of immorality  considerations of depth and perspective a suburban lawn a mountain meadow led me to build a number of north american sets i needed a certain exhilarating milieu nothing is more exhilarating than philistine vulgarity  but in regard to philistine vulgarity there is no intrinsic difference between palearctic manners and nearctic manners any proletarian from chicago can be as bourgeois in the flaubertian sense as a duke i chose american motels instead of swiss hotels or englis h inns only because i am trying to be an american writer and claim only the same rights that other american writers enjoy  on the other hand my creature humbert is a foreigner and an anarchist and there are many things besides nymph ets in which i disagree with him and all my russian readers know that my old worlds—russian british german french—are just as fantastic and personal as my new one is lest the little statement i am making here seem an airing of grudges i must hasten to add that besides the lambs who read the typescript of lolita or its olympia press edition in a spirit of “why did he have to write it” or “why should i read about maniacs” there have been a number of wise sensitive and staunch people who understood my book much better than i can explain its mechanism here every serious writer i dare say is aware of this or that published book of his as of a constant comforting presence its pilot light is stead ily burning somewhere in the basement and a mere touch applied to one’s private thermostat instantly results in a quiet little explosion of familiar warmth this presence this glow of the book in an ever accessible remoteness is a most companionable feeling and the better the book has confo rmed to its prefigured contour and color the ampler and smoother it glow s but even so there are certain points byroads favorite hollows that one evokes more eagerly and enjoys more tenderly than the rest of one’s book i have not reread lolita since i went through the proofs in the spring of  but i find it to be a delightful presence now that it quietly hangs about the house like a summer day which one knows to be bright behind the haze and when i thus think of lolita  i seem always to pick out for special delectation such images as mr taxovich or that class list of ramsdale school or charlotte saying “waterproof” or lolita in slow motion advancing towar d humbert’ s gifts or the pictures decorating the stylized garret of gaston godin or the kasbeam barber who cost me a month of work or lolita playing tennis or the hospital at elphinstone or pale pregnant beloved irretrievabledolly schiller dying in gray star the capital town of the book or the tinkling sounds of the valley town coming up the mountain trail on which i caught the first known female of lycaeides sublivens nabokov these are the nerves of the novel these are the secret points the subliminal co ordinates by means of which the book is plotted—although i realize very clearly that these and other scenes will be skimmed over or not noticed or never even reached by those who begin reading the book under the impression that it is something on the lines of memoirs of a woman of pleasur e or les amours de milor d grosvit  that my nove l does contain various allusion s to the physiol ogical urges of a pervert is quite true but after all we are not children not illiterate juvenile delinquents not english public school boys who after a night of homosexual romps have to endure the paradox of reading the ancients in expur gated versions it is childish to study a work of fiction in order to gain information about a country or about a social class or about the author  and yet one of my very few intimate friends after reading lolita  was sincerely worried that i i should be living “among such depressing people”—when the only discomfort i really experience d was to live in my workshop among discarded limbs and unfinished torsos after olympia press in paris published the book an american critic suggested that lolita was the record of my love affair with the romantic novel the substitution “english language” for “romantic novel” would make this elegant formula more correct but here i feel my voice rising to a much too strident pitch none of my american friends have read my russian books and thus every appraisal on the strength of my english ones is bound to be out of focus my private trage dy which cannot and indeed should not be anybody’ s concern is that i had to abandon my natural idiom my untrammeled rich and infinitely docile russian tongue for a secondrate brand of english devoid of any of those apparatuses—the baffling mirror  the black velvet backdrop the implied associations and traditions—which the native illusionist fractails flying can magically use to transcend the heritage in his own way
