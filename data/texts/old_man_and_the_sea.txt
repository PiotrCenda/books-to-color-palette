he was an old man who fished alone in a sk iff in the gulf stream and he had gone eightyfour days now with out taking a fish in the first fo rty days a boy had been with him but after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao which is the worst form of unlucky and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week it made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skif f empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled li nes or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast th e sail was patched with flour sacks and furled it looked like the flag of permanent defeat the old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck the brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings fr om its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks the blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deepcreased scars from handli ng heavy fish on the cords but none of these scars were fresh they were as old as erosions in a fishless desert everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated “santiago” the boy said to him as they cl imbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up “i could go with you again we’ve made some money” the old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him “no” the old man said “you’re with a lucky boat stay with them” “but remember how you went eightyseven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks” asiaingcom “i remember” the old man said “i know yo u did not leave me because you doubted” “it was papa made me leave i am a boy and i must obey him” “i know” the old man said “it is quite normal” “he hasn’t much faith” “no” the old man said “b ut we have haven’t we” “yes” the boy said “can i offe r you a beer on the terrace an d then we’ll take the stuff home” “why not” the old man said “between fishermen” they sat on the terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was noteangry others of the older fishermen look ed at him and were sad but they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen the successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks with two men staggering at the end of each plank to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to ca rry them to the market in havana those who had caught sharks had take n them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle their livers removed their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting when the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory but today there was only the fa int edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and su nny on the terrace “santiago” the boy said “yes” the old man said he was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago “can i go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow” “no go and play baseball i can stil l row and rogelio will throw the net” “i would like to go if i cannot fish with you i would like to serve in some way” “you bought me a beer” the old ma n said “you are already a man” “how old was i when you firs t took me in a boat” “five and you nearly were killed when i brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces can you remember” “i can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing i can re member you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sw eet blood smell all over me” “can you really remember that or did i just tell it to you” asiaingcom “i remember everything from when we first went together” the old man looked at him with his sunburned confiden t loving eyes “if you were my bo y i’d take you out and gamble” he said “but you are your father’s and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat” “may i get the sardines i know where i can get four baits too” “i have mine left from today i put them in salt in the box” “let me get four fresh ones” “one” the old man said hi s hope and his confidence h ad never gone but now they were freshening as when the breeze rises “two” the boy said “two” the old man agreed “y ou didn’t steal them” “i would” the boy said “but i bought these” “thank you” the old man said he was too simple to wond er when he had attained humility but he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride “tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current” he said “where are you going” the boy asked “far out to come in when the wind shifts i want to be out before it is light” “i’ll try to get him to work far out” the boy said “then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid” “he does not like to work too far out” “no” the boy said “but i wi ll see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin ” “are his eyes that bad” “he is almost blind” “it is strange” the old man said “he never went turt leing that is what kills the eyes” “but you went turtleing for years off the mo squito coast and your eyes are good” “i am a strange old man” “but are you strong enough now for a truly big fish” “i think so and there are many tricks” “let us take the stuff home” the boy said “so i can get the cast net and go after the sardines” they picked up the gear from the boat th e old man carried the ma st on his shoulder asiaingcom and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled hard braided brown lines the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft the box with the baits was under th e stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subd ue the big fish when they were brought alongside no one would steal fr om the old man but it was bett er to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and though he was quite sure no local people would steal from hi m the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat they walked up the road together to th e old man’s shack and went in through its open door the old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sa il against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it the mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack the shack was made of the to ugh budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there wa s a bed a table one chair an d a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal on the brown walls of the flattened overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in colo r of the sacred heart of jesus and another of the virgin of cobre these were relics of his wife once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shel f in the corner unde r his clean shirt “what do you have to eat” the boy asked “a pot of yellow rice with fish do you want some” “no i will eat at home do you want me to make the fire” “no i will make it later on or i may eat the rice cold” “may i take the cast net” “of course” there was no cast net and th e boy remembered when they had sold it but they went through this fiction every day there was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too “eightyfive is a lucky number” the ol d man said “how would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds” “i’ ll get the cast net and go for sardines will you sit in the sun in the doorway” “yes i have yesterday’ s paper and i will read the baseball” the boy did not know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too but the old man brought it out from under the bed “perico gave it to me at th e bodega” he explained “i’ll be back when i have the sardines i’ll keep your s and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning when i come back you can te ll me about the baseball” “the yankees cannot lose” “but i fear the indians of cleveland” asiaingcom “have faith in the yankees my son think of the great dimaggio” “i fear both the tigers of detroi t and the indians of cleveland” “be careful or you will fear even the re ds of cincinnati and the white sax of chicago” “you study it and tell me when i come back” “do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eightyfive tomorrow is the eightyfifth day” “we can do that” the boy said “but what about the eightyseven of your great record” “it could not happen twice do you think you can find an eightyfive” “i can order one “one sheet that’s two dollars and a half who can we bo rrow that from” “that’s easy i can always borrow two dollars and a half” “i think perhaps i can too but i try not to borrow first you borrow then you beg” “keep warm old man” the boy said “remember we are in september” “the month when the great fish come” the old man said “anyone can be a fisherman in may” “i go now for the sardines” the boy said when the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down the boy took the old army blanket off the bed an d spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man’s shou lders they were strange shoulder s still powerful although very old and the neck was still st rong too and the creases did no t show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward his shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many differen t shades by the sun the old man’s head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face the newspaper la y across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze he was barefooted the boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep “wake up old man” the boy said and put hi s hand on one of the old man’s knees the old man opened hi s eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away then he smiled “what have you got” he asked “supper” said the boy “we’ re going to have supper” asiaingcom “i’m not very hungry” “come on and eat you can’t fish and not eat” “i have” the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it then he started to fold the blanket “keep the blanket around you” the boy said “you’ll not fish without eating while i’m alive” “then live a long time and take care of yourself” the old man said “what are we eating” “black beans and rice fried bananas and some stew” the boy had brought them in a twode cker metal container from the terrace the two sets of knives and forks and spoons w e r e i n h i s p o c k e t with a paper napkin wrapped around each set “who gave this to you” “martin the owner” “i must thank him” “i thanked him already” the boy said “you don’t need to thank him” “i’ll give him the belly meat of a big fish” the old man said “has he done this for us more than once” “i think so” “i must give him something mo re than the belly meat then he is very thoughtful for us” “he sent two beers” “i like the beer in cans best” “i know but this is in bottles hatuey beer and i take back the bottles” “that’s very kind of you” the old man said “should we eat” “i’ve been asking you to” the boy told hi m gently “i have not wished to open the container until you were ready” “i’m ready now” the old man sai d “i only needed time to wash” where did you wash the boy thought th e village water supply was two streets down the road i must have water here for him the boy thought and soap and a good towel why am i so thoughtless i must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket asiaingcom “your stew is excellent” the old man said “tell me about the baseba ll” the boy asked him “in the american league it is the yankee s as i said” the old man said happily” “they lost today” th e boy told him “that means nothing the great dimaggio is himself again” “they have other men on the team” “naturally but he makes the difference in the other league between brooklyn and philadelphia i must take brookl yn but then i think of dick sisler and those great drives in the old park” “there was nothing ever like them he hi ts the longest ball i have ever seen” “do you remember when he used to come to the terrace” “i wanted to ta ke him fishing but i was too timid to ask him then i asked you to ask him and you were too timid ” “i know it was a great mistake he might have gone with us then we would have that for all of our lives” “i would like to take the great dimaggio fishing” the old man said “they say his father was a fisherman maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand” “the great sisler’s father was never poor and he the father was playing in the big league s when he was my age” “when i was your age i was before the mast on a square ri gged ship that ran to africa and i have seen lions on the beaches in the evening” “i know you told me” “should we talk about africa or about baseball” “baseball i think” the boy said “tell me about the great john j mcgraw” he said jota for j “he used to come to the terrace sometime s too in the older days but he was rough and harshspoken and difficult when he was drinking his mind was on horses as well as baseball at least he carried li sts of horses at all time s in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone” “he was a great manager” the boy said “my father thinks he was the greatest” “because he came here th e most times” the old man said “if durocher had continued to come here each year your father would th ink him the greatest manager” “who is the greatest manager really luque or mike gonzalez” “i think they are equal” “and the best fisherman is you” asiaingcom “no i know others better” “que va” the boy said “the re are many good fishermen and some great ones but there is only you” “thank you you make me happy i hope no fish wi ll come along so gr eat that he will prove us wrong” “there is no such fish if you are still strong as you say” “i may not be as strong as i think” the ol d man said “but i know many tricks and i have resolution” “you ought to go to bed no w so that you will be fresh in the morning i will take the things back to the terrace” “good night then i will wake you in the morning” “you’re my alarm clock” the boy said “age is my alarm clock” the old man said “w hy do old men wake so early is it to have one longer day” “i don’t know” the boy said “all i know is that young boys sleep late and hard” “i can remember it” the old man said “i’ll waken you in time” “i do not like for him to waken me it is as though i were inferior” “i know” “sleep well old man” the boy went out they had ea ten with no light on the ta ble and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark he rolled his trou sers up to make a pillow putting the newspaper inside them he rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that cove red the springs of the bed he was asleep in a short time and he drea med of africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches so white they hurt your eyes and the high capes and the great brown moun tains he lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw th e native boats come riding through it he smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of africa that the land breeze brought at morning usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy but tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see th e white peaks of the is lands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbou rs and roadsteads of the canary islands he no longer dreamed of storms nor of women nor of great occurrences nor of great fish nor fights nor contes ts of strength nor of his wife he only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach they played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy he never dreamed about the boy he simply woke looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers an d put them on he urinated asiaingcom outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy he was shivering with the morning cold but he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing the door of the house wher e the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet the boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the li ght that came in from the dying moon he took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him the old man nodded and the boy took his trouse rs from the chair by the bed and sitting on the bed pulled them on the old man went out the door and the boy came after him he was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shou lders and said “i am sorry” “qua va” the boy said “it is what a man must do” they walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the road in the dark barefoot men were moving carryi ng the masts of their boats when they reached the old man’s shack the bo y took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carr ied the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder “do you want coffee” the boy asked “we’ll put the gear in the boat and then get some” they had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen “how did you sleep old man” the boy asked he was wa king up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep “very well manolin” the old man said “i feel confident today” “so do i” the boy said “now i must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits he brings our gear himself he ne ver wants anyone to carry anything” “we’re different” the old man said “i let you carry things when you were five years old” “i know it” the boy said “i’ll be right back have another coffee we have credit here” he walked off barefooted on the coral ro cks to the ice house where the baits were stored the old man drank his coffee slowly it wa s all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it for a long time no w eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch he had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and th at was all he needed for the day asiaingcom the boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff feeling the pebbled sand under their feet and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water “good luck old man” “good luck” the old man said he fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and leaning forward agains t the thrust of the blades in the water he began to row out of the harbour in the dark there were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard th e dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills sometimes someone would speak in a boat bu t most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars they sp read apart after they were ou t of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part of the ocea n where he hoped to find fish the old man knew he was going far out and he left the sme ll of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean he sa w the phosphorescence of the gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden de ep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current m ade against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them in the dark the old man could feel the morn ing coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made a s t h e y s o a r e d a w a y i n t h e d a r k n e s s h e w a s v e r y f o n d o f f l y i n g f i s h a s t h e y w e r e h i s principal friends on the ocean he was sorry for the birds especial ly the small delicate dark terns that were always fl ying and looking and almost ne ver finding and he thought the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones why did they make birds so delicate an d fine as those sea sw allows when the ocean can be so cruel she is kind and very beauti ful but she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fl y dipping and hunting with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea he always thought of the sea as la mar which is what peop le call her in spanish when they love her sometimes thos e who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman some of the younger fishermen those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats bought when the shark livers had brought much money spoke of her as el mar which is masculine they spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy but the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not he lp them the moon affects her as it does a woman he thought he was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat exce pt for the occasional swirls of the current he was letting the current do a third of the work and as it st arted to be light he saw he was already further out than he ha d hoped to be at this hour asiaingcom i worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing he thought today i’ll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them before it was really light he had his baits ou t and was drifting with the current one bait was down forty fathoms the second was at seventyfive and the th ird and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundre d and twentyfive fathoms each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook in side the bait fish ti ed and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook the cu rve and the point was covered with fresh sardines each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a halfgarland on the projecting steel there was no part of th e hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting the boy had given him two fresh small tunas or al bacores which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and on the ot hers he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before but they were in good condit ion still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness each line as thick around as a big pencil was looped onto a greensapped st ick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two fortyfathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that if it were necessary a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at th eir proper depths it was quite light and any moment no w the sun would rise the sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats low on the water and well in toward the shore spre ad out across the current then the sun was brighter and the glare came on th e water and then as it rose clea r the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it he looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water he kept them straighter than anyone did so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly wh ere he wished it to be for any fish that swam there others let them drift with th e current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thou ght they were at a hundred but he thought i keep them with precision only i have no luck any more but who knows maybe today every day is a new day it is better to be lucky but i would rather be exact then when luck comes you are ready the sun was two hours higher no w and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east there were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore all my life the early sun has hurt my eyes he thought ye t they are still good in the evening i can look straight into it without ge tting the blackness it has more force in the evening too but in the mo rning it is painful j u s t t h e n h e s a w a m a n o f w a r b i r d w i t h his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him he made a quic k drop slanting down on his backswept wings and then asiaingcom circled again “he’s got something” the old man said aloud “he’s not just looking” he rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling he did not hurry and he kept his lines st raight up and down but he crowde d the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird the bird went higher in the air and circled again his wings motionless then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flyi ng fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface “dolphin” the old man sa id aloud “big dolphin” he shipped his oars and brou ght a small line from under the bow it had a wire leader and a mediumsized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines he let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow he went back to rowing and to watching the longwinged black bird who was work ing now low over the water as he watched the bird dipped again sl anting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish the old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish the dolphin were cutting through the water belo w the flight of the fish and would be in the water driving at speed when the fish dropped it is a big sc hool of dolphin he thought they are widespread and the flying fish have little chance the bird has no chance the flying fish are too bi g for him and they go too fast he watched the flying fish burst out agai n and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird that school has gotten away from me he thought they are moving out too fast and too far but perhaps i will pick up a stray and pe rhaps my big fish is around them my big fish must be somewhere the clouds over the land no w rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it the water was a dark blue now so dark that it was almost purple as he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun ma de now he watched hi s lines to see them go straight down out of sigh t into the water and he was ha ppy to see so much plankton because it meant fish the strange light the su n made in the water now that the sun was higher meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land but the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing show ed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow sunbleached sargasso we ed and the purple fo rmalized iridescent gelatinous bladder of a portuguese manofwar floating dose beside the boat it turned on its side and then righted itself it floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water “agua mala” the man said “you whore” from where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw asiaingcom the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted they were immune to its poison but men were not and when same of the fila ments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was workin g a fish he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that pois on ivy or poison oak can give but these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash the iridescent bubbles were beautiful but they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turt les eating them the turtles saw them approached them from the front then shut th eir eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and al l the old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them po p when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet he loved green turtles and hawkbills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for th e huge stupid loggerheads yellow in their armourplating strange in their lovem aking and happily ea ting the portuguese menofwar with their eyes shut he had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years he was sorry for them all even the grea t trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle’s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up an d butchered but the old man thought i have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs he ate the white eggs to give himself strength he ate them all through may to be strong in september and october for the truly big fish he also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept th eir gear it was there for all fishermen who wanted it most fishermen hated the taste but it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good agains t all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes now the old man looked up and saw th at the bird was circling again “he’s found fish” he said al oud no flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish but as the old man watched a small tuna rose in the air turned and dropped head first into the water the tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions churning the wa ter and leaping in long jump s after the bait they were circling it and driving it if they don’t travel too fast i will get into them the ol d man thought and he watched the school working the water white and the bi rd now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic “the bird is a great help” the old man said just then the stern line came taut under his foot where he had kept a l oop of the line and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight of the small tuna’s shivering pu ll as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in the shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he sw ung him over the side and into the boat he asiaingcom lay in the stern in the sun compact and bullet shaped his big unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the plan king of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat fastmoving tail th e old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him his body still shudde ring under the shade of the stern “albacore” he said aloud “he’ll make a beautiful bait he’ll weigh ten pounds” he did not remember when he had first starte d to talk aloud when he was by himself he had sung when he was by himself in the old da ys and he had sung at night sometimes w h e n h e w a s a l o n e s t e e r i n g o n h i s w a t c h i n t h e s m a c k s o r i n t h e t u r t l e b o a t s h e h a d probably started to talk aloud when alon e when the boy had left but he did not remember when he and the boy fished togeth er they usually spok e only when it was necessary they talked at night or when they were stormbound by bad weather it was considered a virtue not to talk unnecess arily at sea and the old man had always considered it so and respecte d it but now he said his thou ghts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy “if the others heard me talking out loud th ey would think that i am crazy” he said aloud “but since i am not crazy i do not care and the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the baseball” now is no time to think of baseball he thought now is the time to think of only one thing that which i was born for there might be a big one around that school he thought i picked up only a st raggler from the albacore that were feeding but they are working far out and fast everyt hing that shows on the surfac e today travels very fast and to the northeast can that be the time of day or is it some sign of weather that i do not know he could not see the gr een of the shore now but only th e tops of the blue hills that showed white as though they were snowcapped and the clou ds that looked like high snow mountains above them the sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water the myriad flecks of the plankton we re annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep the tuna the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits were down again the sun was hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed i could just drift he thought and sleep and put a bight of line ar ound my toe to wake me but today is eightyfive days and i should fish the day well just then watching his lines he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply “yes” he said “yes” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat he reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand he felt no strain nor weight and he held the line ligh tly then it came again this time it was a tentative pull not solid nor heavy and he knew exactly what it was one hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of asiaingcom the hook where the handforge d hook projected from the head of the small tuna the old man held the line delicately and soft ly with his left han d unleashed it from the stick now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension this far out he must be huge in this mo nth he thought eat them fish eat them please eat them how fresh they are and you down there si x hundred feet in that cold water in the dark make another turn in the dark and co me back and eat them he felt the light delicate pulling and then a ha rder pull when a sardine’s head must have been more difficult to break from the hook then there was nothing “come on” the old man said aloud “make another turn just smell them aren’t they lovely eat them good now and then there is the tuna hard and cold and lovely don’t be shy fish eat them” he waited with the line be tween his thumb and his finger watching it and the other lines a t the same time for the fish might have sw um up or down then came the same delicate pulling touch again “he’ll take it” the old man said al oud “god help him to take it” he did not take it though he was go ne and the old man felt nothing “he can’t have gone” he said “christ know s he can’t have gone he’s making a turn maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers something of it then he felt the gentle touc h on the line and he was happy “it was only his turn” he said “he’ll take it” he was happy feeling the ge ntle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably heavy it was th e weight of the fish and he let the line slip down down down unrolling off the first of the two reserv e coils as it went down slipping lightly through the old man’s fingers he still could fe el the great weight though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost impercep tible “what a fish” he said “he has it sideways in his mout h now and he is moving off with it” then he will turn and swallow it he though t he did not say th at because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen he knew wh at a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the dark ness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth at that moment he felt him stop moving but the weig ht was still there then the weight increased and he gave more line he tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight in creased and was going straight down “he’s taken it” he said “now i’ll let him eat it well” he let the line slip through his fingers whil e he reached down with his left hand and made fast the free end of the two reserve coil s to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line now he was ready he had three fortyfathom coils of line in reserve now as asiaingcom well as the coil he was using “eat it a little more” he said “eat it well” eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you he thought come up easy and let me put the harpoon in to you all right ar e you ready have you been long enough at table “now” he said aloud and struck hard with both hands gained a yard of line and then struck again and again swinging with ea ch arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body nothing happened the fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch his line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he stil l held it bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back agains t the pull the boat began to move slowly off toward the northwest the fish moved steadily and they travelled sl owly on the calm wa ter the other baits were still in the water but th ere was nothing to be done “i wish i had the boy” the old man said alou d “i’m being towed by a fish and i’m the towing bitt i could make the line fast but then he coul d break it i must hold him all i can and give him line when he must have it thank god he is travelling and not going down” what i will do if he decides to go down i don’t know what i’ll do if he sounds and dies i don’t know but i’ll do something there are plenty of things i can do he held the line against his back and wa tched its slant in th e water and the skiff moving steadily to the northwest this will kill him the old man thought he can’t do this forever but four hours later the fish was still swimming stea dily out to sea towing the skiff and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across his back “it was noon when i hooked him” he said “and i have never seen him” he had pushed his straw hat hard down on hi s head before he hook ed the fish and it was cutting his forehead he was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and being careful not to jerk on the line moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand he opened it and drank a little then he rested against the bow he rested sitting on the unstepped mast and sail an d tried not to think but only to endure then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible that makes no d i f f e r e n c e h e t h o u g h t i c a n a l w a y s c o m e i n o n t h e g l o w f r o m h a v a n a t h e r e a r e t w o more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that if he doesn’t maybe he will come up with the moon if he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise i have no cramps and i feel strong it is he that has th e hook in his mouth asiaingcom but what a fish to pull like that he must have his mouth shut tight on the wire i wish i could see him i wish i could see him only once to know what i have against me the fish never changed his course nor his di rection all that night as far as the man could tell from watching th e stars it was cold after th e sun went down and the old man’s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs during the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry after the sun w e n t d o w n h e t i e d i t a r o u n d h i s n e c k s o that it hung down ov er his back and he cautiously worked it down un der the line that was across his shoulders now the sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable the position actually was only somewhat less intolerable but he thought of it as al most comfortable i can do nothing with him and he can do noth ing with me he though t not as long as he keeps this up once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course the line showed like a ph osphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders they were moving more slowly now and the glow of havana was not so strong so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward if i lose the glare of havana we must be going more to the eastward he thought for if the fish’s course held true i must see it for many more hours i wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today he thought it would be wonder ful to do this with a radio then he thought think of it always think of what you are doing you must do nothing stupid then he said aloud “i wish i had the boy to help me and to see this” no one should be alone in th eir old age he thought but it is unavoidable i must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong remember no matter how little you want to that you must eat him in the morn ing remember he said to himself during the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and blowing he could tell th e difference between the blowin g noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female “they are good” he said “t hey play and make jokes and love one another they are our brothers like the flying fish” then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked he is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is he thought ne ver have i had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely perhaps he is too wise to jump he could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush but perh aps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight he cannot know that it is only one man against him nor that it is an old man but what a great fish he is and what will he bring in the market if the flesh is good he took the bait like a male an d he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it i wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as i am he remembered the time he had hooked on e of a pair of marlin the male fish asiaingcom always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish the female made a wild panicstricken despairing figh t that soon exhausted her an d all the time the male had stayed with her crossing the line and circling with her on the surface he had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that si ze and shape when the old ma n had gaffed her and clubbed her holding the rapier bill with its sandpape r edge and dubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the back ing of mirrors and then with the boy’s aid hoisted her aboar d the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat then while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the fe male was and then went down deep his lavender wings that were his pe ctoral fins spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing he was beautiful the old man remembered and he had stayed that was the saddest thing i ever saw with them the ol d man thought the boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly “i wish the boy was here” he said alou d and settled himself against the rounded planks of the bow and felt the st rength of the great fish throug h the line he he ld across his shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen when once through my treachery it had been necessary to hi m to make a choice the old man thought his choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and treacheries my choice was to go th ere to find him beyond all people beyond all people in the world now we ar e joined together and have be en since noon and no one to help either one of us perhaps i should not have been a fisherman he thought but that was the thing that i was born for i must sure ly remember to eat the tuna after it gets light some time before daylight something took one of the bait s that were behind him he heard the stick break and the line begi n to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff in the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale then he cut the other line closest to hi m and in the dark made the lo ose ends of the reserve coils fast he worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight now he had six reserve co ils of line there we re two from each bait he had severed and the two from the ba it the fish had taken and they were all connected after it is light he thought i will work ba ck to the fortyfathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve co ils i will have lost two hund red fathoms of good catalan cardel and the hooks and leaders that can be replaced but who repl aces this fish if i hook some fish and it cuts him off i don’t know what that fish was that took the bait just now it could have been a marlin or a broadbill or a shark i never fe lt him i had to get rid of him too fast aloud he said “i wi sh i had the boy” asiaingcom but you haven’t got the boy he thou ght you have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now in th e dark or not in the dark and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils so he did it it was difficult in the dark and once the fi sh made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye the blood ran down his cheek a little way but it coagulated and drie d before it reached his chin an d he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood he adjust ed the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and holding it anchored with his shoulders he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water i wonder what he made that lurch for he thought the wi re must have slipped on the great hill of his back certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does but he cannot pull this skiff forever no matter how great he is now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and i have a big rese rve of line all that a man can ask “fish” he said softly aloud “i’ ll stay with you until i am dead” he’ll stay with me too i suppose the old man thought and he waited for it to be light it was cold now in the time before daylight and he pu shed against the wood to be warm i can do it as long as he can he thought and in the fi rst light the line extended out and down into the water the boat moved steadi ly and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old man’s right shoulder “he’s headed north” the old man said th e current will have set us far to the eastward he thought i wish he would turn with the current that would show that he was tiring when the sun had rise n further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring there was only one favorable sign the slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth that did not necessarily me an that he would jump but he might “god let him jump” the old man said “i have enough line to handle him” maybe if i can increase the tension just a li ttle it will hurt him and he will jump he thought now that it is daylight let him jump so that he’ll fi ll the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die he tried to increase the tension but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he h ad hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it i must not jerk it ever he thought each jerk widens th e cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it anyway i feel better with the sun an d for once i do not have to look into it there was yellow weed on the line but th e old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased it was the ye llow gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night “fish” he said “i love you and respect you very much but i will kill you dead before this day ends” asiaingcom let us hope so he thought a small bird came toward the skiff from th e north he was a warb ler and flying very low over the water the old man could see that he wa s very tired the bird made the stern of the boat and rested there then he flew arou nd the old man’s head an d rested on the line where he was more comfortable “how old are you” the old man asked the bird “is this your first trip” the bird looked at him when he spok e he was too tired even to examine the line and he teetered on it as hi s delicate feet gripped it fast “it’s steady” the old man told him “it’s to o steady you shouldn’t be that tired after a windless night what ar e birds coming to” the hawks he thought that come out to sea to meet them but he said nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough “take a good rest small bird” he said “t hen go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish” it encouraged him to talk be cause his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now “stay at my house if you like bird” he said “i am sorry i cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising but i am with a friend” just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would have pulled him overboard if he h ad not braced himself and given some line the bird had flown up when the line jerk ed and the old man had not even seen him go he felt the line care fully with his right hand and no ticed his hand was bleeding “something hurt him then” he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the fish but when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line “you’re feeling it now fish” he said “and so god knows am i” he looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company the bird was gone you did not stay long the man thought bu t it is rougher where you are going until you make the shore how did i let the fish cu t me with that one qu ick pull he made i must be getting very stupid or perhaps i was looking at th e small bird and thinking of him now i will pay attention to my work and then i must eat the tuna so that i will not have a failure of strength “i wish the boy were here and that i had some salt” he said aloud asiaingcom shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in the ocean and held it there subm erged for more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved “he has slowed much” he said the old man would have liked to keep his ha nd in the salt wate r longer but he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish an d he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against the sun it was only a line burn that h ad cut his flesh but it was in the working part of his hand he knew he would need his ha nds before this was over and he did not like to be cu t before it started “now” he said when his hand had dried “i must eat the small tuna i can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort” he knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines holdin g the line with his left shoulder again and bracing on his left hand and ar m he took the tuna off the ga ff hook and put the gaff back in place he put one knee on the fish and cu t strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail they were we dgeshaped strips and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge of th e belly when he had cu t six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bo w wiped his knife on his trouse rs and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard “i don’t think i can eat an en tire one” he said and drew his knife across one of the strips he could feel the steady hard pull of the line and hi s left hand was cramped it drew up tight on the heavy cord an d he looked at it in disgust “what kind of a hand is that” he said “cra mp then if you want make yourself into a claw it will do you no good” come on he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line eat it now and it will strength en the hand it is not the hand’s fault and you have been many hours with the fish bu t you can stay with him fore ver eat the bonito now he picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly it was not unpleasant chew it well he thought and get all the juices it would not be had to eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt “how do you feel hand” he asked the crampe d hand that was almost as stiff as rigor mortis “i’ll eat some more for you” he ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two he chewed it carefully and then spat out the skin “how does it go hand or is it too early to know” he took another full piece and chewed it asiaingcom “it is a strong fullblooded fish” he thought “i was lucky to get him instead of dolphin dolphin is too sweet this is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it” there is no sense in being anything but pr actical though he thought i wish i had some salt and i do not know whether the sun will rot or dr y what is left so i had better eat it all although i am not hungry the fish is calm and steady i will eat it all and then i will be ready “be patient hand” he sai d “i do this for you” i wish i could feed th e fish he thought he is my br other but i must kill him and keep strong to do it slowly and conscientiou sly he ate all of the wedgeshaped strips of fish he straightened up wiping hi s hand on his trousers “now ” he said “you can let the cord go hand and i will handle him with th e right arm alone until you stop that nonsense” he put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back “god help me to have the cramp go” he said “because i do not know what the fish is going to do” but he seems calm he though t and following his plan but what is his plan he thought and what is mine mine i must improv ise to his because of his great size if he will jump i can kill him but he stays down forever then i will stay down with him forever he rubbed the cramped hand ag ainst his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers but it would not open maybe it wi ll open with the sun he thou ght maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna is digested if i have to ha ve it i will open it cost whatever it costs but i do not want to open it no w by force let it open by itself and come back of its own accord after all i abused it mu ch in the night when it was ne cessary to free and untie the various lines he looked across the sea and knew how al one he was now but he could see the prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and th e strange undulation of the calm the clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching them selves against the sky over the water then blurring then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea he thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boar and knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather but now they were in hurricane months and when there are no hurr icanes the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year if there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead if you are at sea they do not see it ashore becaus e they do not know wh at to look for he thought the land must make a difference too in the shape of the clouds but we have no hurricane coming now he looked at the sky and saw the white cumu lus built like friendly piles of ice cream asiaingcom and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high september sky “light brisa” he said “better weather for me than for you fish” his left hand was still cramped bu t he was unknotting it slowly i hate a cramp he thought it is a treachery of one’s own body it is humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptom aine poisoning or to vomit from it but a cramp he thought of it as a calambre humili ates oneself especially when one is alone if the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm he thought but it will loosen up then with his right hand he felt the differe nce in the pull of th e line before he saw the slant change in the water then as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward “he’s coming up” he said “com e on hand please come on” the line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out he came out unendingly and water po ured from his sides he was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender his sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then reentered it smoothly like a diver and the old man saw the gr eat scytheblade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out “he is two feet longer than the skiff” th e old man said the line was going out fast but steadily and the fish was not panicked the old man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside of breaking strength he knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the li ne and break it he is a great fish and i must convince him he thought i must never let him learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run if i were him i would put in everything now and go until something brok e but thank god they are no t as intelligent as we who kill them although they are more noble and more able the old man had seen many great fish he had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had ca u g h t t w o o f t h a t s i z e i n h i s life but never alone now alone and out of sight of land he was fast to the biggest fi sh that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle it will uncramp though he thought surely it will uncramp to help my right hand there are three things that are brothe rs the fish and my two hands it must uncramp it is unworthy of it to be cramped the fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace i wonder why he jumped the old man thought he jumped almost as though to show me how big he was i know now anyway he thought i wish i could show him what sort of man i am but then he would see the cr amped hand let him think i am more man asiaingcom than i am and i will be so i wish i was the fish he thou ght with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence he settled comfortably against the wood and took his suff ering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the da rk water there was a small sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man’s left hand was uncramped “bad news for you fish” he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders he was comfortable but sufferi ng although he did not admit the suffering at all “i am not religious” he said “but i will say ten our fathers and ten hail marys that i should catch this fish and i promise to make a pilgrimage to the virgin of cobre if i catch him that is a promise” he commenced to say his prayers mechanica lly sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the pray er and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically hail ma rys are easier to say than our fathers he thought “hail mary full of grace the lord is wi th thee blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our de ath amen” then he added “blessed virgin pray for the death of this fish wonderful though he is” with his prayers said and feeling much be tter but suffering exactly as much and perhaps a little more he leaned against the wo od of the bow and began mechanically to work the fingers of his left hand the sun was hot now although th e breeze was rising gently “i had better rebait that little line out over the stern” he said “i f the fish decides to stay another night i will need to eat again and the water is low in th e bottle i don’t think i can get anything but a dolphin here bu t if i eat him fresh en ough he won’t be bad i wish a flying fish would come on board toni ght but i have no li ght to attract them a flying fish is excellent to eat raw and i woul d not have to cut him up i must save all my strength now christ i did not know he was so big” “i’ll kill him though” he said “i n all his greatness and his glory” although it is unjust he th ought but i will show him wh at a man can do and what a man endures “i told the boy i was a st range old man” he said “now is when i must prove it” the thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing now he was proving it again each time was a new time and he neve r thought about the past when he was doing it asiaingcom i wish he’d sleep and i could sleep and dr eam about the lions he thought why are the lions the main thing that is left don’t thin k old man he said to himself rest gently now against the wood and think of nothing he is working work as little as you can it was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily but there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly once in the afternoon the line started to ri se again but the fish only continued to swim at a slightly higher le vel the sun was on the old ma n’s left arm and shoulder and on his back so he knew the fish had turned east of north now that he had seen him on ce he could picture the fi sh swimming in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark i wonder how much he sees at that dept h the old man thought his eye is huge and a horse with much less eye can see in the dark once i could see qu ite well in the dark not in the absolute dark bu t almost as a cat sees the sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely and he began to shift more of the st rain to it and he sh rugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little “if you’re not tired fish” he said al oud “you must be very strange” he felt very tired now and he knew the ni ght would come soon and he tried to think of other things he thought of the big leagues to him they were the gran ligas and he knew that the yankees of new york were playing the tigres of detroit this is the second day now that i do not kn ow the result of the juegos he thought but i must have confidence and i must be worthy of the great dimaggio who does all things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel what is a bone spur he asked himself un espuela de hueso we do n o t h a v e t h e m c a n i t b e a s p a i n f u l a s th e spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel i do no t think i could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and cont inue to fight as the fighting cocks do man is not much beside the great birds and beasts still i woul d rather be that beast down there in the darkness of the sea “unless sharks come” he said aloud “if sharks come god pity him and me” do you believe the great dimaggio would stay with a fish as long as i will stay with this one he thought i am su re he would and more since he is young and strong also his father was a fisherman but would th e bone spur hurt him too much “i do not know” he said alou d “i never had a bone spur” as the sun set he remembered to give himself more confidence the time in the t a v e r n a t c a s a b l a n c a w h e n h e h a d p l a y e d the hand game with the great negro from cienfuegos who was the strong est man on the docks they had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight each one was trying to force the other’s hand down onto the asiaingcom table there was much bettin g and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the ar m and hand of the negr o and at the negro’s face they changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep blood came out fr om under the fingernails of both his and the negro’s hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched the walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamp s threw their shadows against them the negro’s shadow was huge an d it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps the odds would change back and forth al l night and they fed the negro rum and lighted cigarettes for him then the negro after the rum would try fo r a tremendous effort and once he had the old man who was not an old man th en but was santiago el campeon nearly three inches off balance but the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again he was sure then that he had the negro who wa s a fine man and a grea t athlete beaten and at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be calle d a draw and the referee was shaking his head he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood the matc h had started on a sun day morning and ended on a monday morning many of the bettors ha d asked for a draw because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the havana coal company otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a fini sh but he had finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work for a long time after that everyone ha d called him the champion and there had been a return match in the sp ring but not much money was bet and he had won it quite easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from ci enfuegos in the first match after that he had a few matches and then no more he decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was ba d for his right hand for fishing he had tried a few practice matches with his left hand but his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it t h e s u n w i l l b a k e i t o u t w e l l n o w h e t h o u g h t i t s h o u l d n o t c r a m p o n m e a g a i n unless it gets too cold in the night i wonder what this night will bring an airplane passed overhead on its cour se to miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the school s of flying fish “with so much flying fish there should be dolphin” he said and leaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish but he could not and it stayed at the hardness and waterdrop shivering that prec eded breaking the boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the airplane unti l he could no longer see it it must be very strange in an airplane he thought i wo nder what the sea looks like from that height they should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high i would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above in the turtle boats i was in the crosstrees of the masthead an d even at that height i saw much the dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple asiaingcom spots and you can see all of the school as they swim why is it that all the fastmoving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually pu rple stripes or spots the dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden but when he comes to feed truly hungry purple stripes sh ow on his sides as on a marlin can it be anger or the greater speed he makes that brings them out just before it was dark as they passed a great island of sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocea n were making love wi th something under a yellow blanket his small line wa s taken by a dolphin he saw it first when it jumped in the air true gold in the last of the sun an d bending and flapping wildly in the air it jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand st epping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot when the fish was at the stem plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation the old man leaned over the stern and lifted the bu rnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stem its jaws were workin g convulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still the old man unhooked the fish rebaited th e line with another sardine and tossed it over then he worked his way slowly back to the bow he washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers then he shifted the heavy line from hi s right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea while he wa tched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord “he hasn’t changed at all” he said but watching the mo vement of the water against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower “i’ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night” he said “he’s good for the night and so am i” it would be better to gut the dolphin a litt le later to save the blood in the meat he thought i can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time i had better keep the fi sh quiet now and not disturb him t oo much at sunset the setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish he let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much or more than he did i’m learning how to do it he thought this part of it anyway th en too remember he hasn’t eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and need s much food i have eaten the whole bonito tomorrow i will eat the dolphin he called it dorado perhaps i should eat some of it when i clean it it will be harder to eat than th e bonito but then nothing is easy “how do you feel fish” he asked aloud “i feel good and my left hand is better and i have food for a night and a day pull the boat fish” he did not truly feel good because the pain from the co rd across his back had almost passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted but i ha ve had worse things than that he thought my hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other asiaingcom my legs are all right also now i have gain ed on him in the question of sustenance it was dark now as it become s dark quickly after the sun sets in september he lay against the worn wood of the bow and rested al l that he could the first stars were out he did not know the name of rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant friends “the fish is my friend too” he said aloud “i have never seen or heard of such a fish but i must kill him i am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars” imagine if each day a man must try to ki ll the moon he thought the moon runs away but imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill th e sun we were born lucky he thought then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his so rrow for him how many people will he feed he thought but are they worthy to eat him no of course not there is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behavi our and his great dignity i do not understand these thin gs he thought but it is g ood that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars it is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers now he thought i must think about the dr ag it has its perils and its merits i may lose so much line that i will lose him if he makes his effort and the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed no matter what passes i must gut th e dolphin so he does not spoi l and eat some of him to be strong now i will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before i move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision in th e meantime i can see how he acts and if he shows any changes th e oars are a good trick but it has reached the time to play for safety he is much fish still and i saw th at the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut the punishment of the h ook is nothing the punishment of hunger and that he is agains t something that he does not comprehend is everything rest now old man and let hi m work until your next duty comes he rested for what he believed to be two hours the moon did no t rise now until late and he had no way of judging the time nor wa s he really resting except comparatively he was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself how simple it would be if i could make the line fast he thought but with one small lurch he could break it i must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line with both hands “but you have not slept yet old man” he said aloud “it is half a day and a night and now another day and you have not slept you must devise a way so that you sleep a little if asiaingcom he is quiet and steady if you do not slee p you might become un clear in the head” i’m clear enough in the head he thought too clear i am as clear as the stars that are my brothers still i must sleep they sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm but remember to sleep he thought make you rself do it and devise some simple and sure way about the lines now go back and prepare the dolphin it is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep i could go without sleeping he told hims elf but it would be too dangerous he started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees being careful not to jerk against the fish he may be half asleep hi mself he thought but i do not want him to rest he must pull until he dies back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand the stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pu shed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the stern he pu t one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear he felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open there were two flying fish inside they were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills over the stern they sa nk leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water the dolphin was cold and a leprous graywhite now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held hi s right foot on the fish’s head then he turned him over and skinned th e other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail he slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water but there was only the light of its slow descent he turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his kn ife back in its sheath he worked his way slowly back to the bow his back was be nt with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them after that he settled the line ac ross his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand resting on the gunwal e then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water noting th e speed of the water agains t his hand his hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it the flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern “he is tiring or he is restin g” the old man said “now let me get through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep” under the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of one of the dolphin fillets and one of th e flying fish gutted and with its head cut off asiaingcom “what an excellent fish dolphi n is to eat cooked” he said “and what a miserable fish raw i will never go in a boat again without salt or limes” if i had brains i would have splashed wate r on the bow all day and drying it would have made salt he thought but then i did no t hook the dolphin until almost sunset still it was a lack of preparation but i have ch ewed it all well and i am not nauseated the sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone it looked now as though he were moving into a great ca nyon of clouds and the wind had dropped “there will be bad weather in three or four days” he said “but not tonight and not tomorrow rig now to get some sleep old ma n while the fish is calm and steady” he held the line tight in hi s right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow then he passed the line a little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it my right hand can hold it as lo ng as it is braced he thought if it relaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as th e line goes out it is hard on the right hand but he is used to punishment even if i sleep twenty minutes or a half an ho ur it is good he lay forward cramping himself against the line with all of his body putting all his weight onto his right band and he was asleep he did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porp oises that stretched for eight or ten miles and it wa s in the time of thei r mating and they would leap high into the air and return into the sa me hole they had made in th e water when they leaped then he dreamed that he was in the vill age on his bed and th ere was a norther and he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow after that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark an d then the other lions ca me and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where the sh i p l a y a n c h o r e d w i t h the evening offshore breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy the moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and the boat moved in to the tunnel of clouds he woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his right hand he had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rush ed out finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly he look ed back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly just then the fish jumped making a great bursti ng of the ocean and then a heavy fall then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the st rain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again he had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move asiaingcom this is what we waited for he thought so now let us take it make him pay for the line he thought make him pay for it he could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he fell the speed of th e line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and he trie d to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers if the boy was here he would wet the coils of line he thought yes if the boy were here if the boy were here the line went out and out an d out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each inch of it now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet he was ceding line but more sl owly all he time he worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see there was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water yes he thought and now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where i cannot bring him up he will start circling soon and then i must work on him i wonder what started him so suddenly could it have been hunger that made him desperate or was he frightened by something in th e night maybe he suddenly fe lt fear but he was such a calm strong fish and he seemed so fear less and so confident it is strange “you better be fearless and confident yours elf old man” he said “you’re holding him again but you cannot get line but soon he has to circle” the old man held him with his left hand and his shou lders now and stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin fles h off of his face he was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength when his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise he’s headed almost east he thought that means he is tired and going with the current soon he will have to circle then our true work begins after he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it “it is not bad” he said “and p ain does not matter to a man” he took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted his weight so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff “you did not do so badly fo r something worthless” he s aid to his left hand “but there was a moment when i could not find you” why was i not born with two g ood hands he thought perh aps it was my fault in not training that one properly bu t god knows he has had enough chances to learn he did not do so badly in the night though and he has only cramped once if he cramps again asiaingcom let the line cut him off when he thought that he knew that he was not being clea rheaded and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin but i can’t he told himself it is better to be lightheaded than to lose your strength from nausea and i know i cannot keep it if i eat it since my face was in it i will keep it for an emergency until it goes ba d but it is too late to try for strength now through nourishment you’re stupid he told himself eat the other flying fish it was there cleaned and ready and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail it has more nourishment than almost any fish he thought at least the kind of strength that i need now i have done what i can he thought let him begin to circle and let the fight come the sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle he could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling it was too early for that he just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand it tightened as always but just when he reached the point where it would break line began to come in he slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and g e n t l y h e u s e d b o t h o f h i s hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his legs his old legs and shoulders pivo ted with the swinging of the pulling “it is a very big circle” he said “but he is circling” then the li ne would not come in any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun then it started out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water “he is making the far part of his circle now” he said i must hold all i can he thought the strain will shorten his circle each time perhaps in an hour i will see him now i must convince him and then i must kill him but the fish kept on circli ng slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his bones two hours later but the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could tell the fi sh had risen steadily while he swam for an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his ey e and on his forehead he was not afraid of the black spots they were normal at the tens ion that he was pullin g on the line twice though he had felt faint and di zzy and that had worried him “i could not fail myself and die on a fish like this” he said “now that i have him coming so beautifully god help me endure i’ll say a hundred our fathers and a hundred hail marys but i cann ot say them now consider them said he though t i’ll say them later just then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands it was sharp and hardfeeling and heavy asiaingcom he is hitting the wire leader with his spear he thou ght that was bound to come he had to do that it may ma ke him jump though and i woul d rather he stayed circling now the jumps were necessary for him to take air but afte r that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound an d he can throw the hook “don’t jump fish” he said “don’t jump” the fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old man gave up a little line i must hold his pain where it is he thought mine do es not matter i can control mine but his pain co uld drive him mad after a while the fish stoppe d beating at the wire and st arted circling slowly again the old man was gaining line steadily now but he felt faint again he lifted some sea water with his left hand and put it on his he ad then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck “i have no cramps” he said “he’ll be up soon and i can last yo u have to last don’t even speak of it” he kneeled against the bow and for a moment slipped the line over his back again i’ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in he decided it was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself without recovering any line but when the strain show ed the fish had turned to come toward the boat the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained i’m tireder than i have ever been he thought and now the trade wind is rising but that will be good to take him in with i need that badly “i’ll rest on the next turn as he goes out” he said “i feel much better then in two or three turns more i will have him” his straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn you work now fish he thought i’ll take you at the turn the sea had risen considerably but it was a fa irweather breeze and he had to have it to get home “i’ll just steer south an d west” he said “a man is never lost at sea and it is a long island” it was on the third turn that he saw the fish first he saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believe its length asiaingcom “no” he said “he ca n’t be that big” but he was that big and at th e end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away and the man saw his tail out of water it was hi gher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water it raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him his dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals we re spread wide on this circle the old man co uld see the fish’s eye and the two gray sucking fish that swain around him sometimes they attached themselves to him so metimes they darted off sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow they were each over three feet long and when they swam fast they lash ed their whole bodies like eels the old man was sweating now but from so mething else besides the sun on each c a l m p l a c i d t u r n t h e f i s h m a d e h e w a s g a i n ing line and he was su re that in two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in but i must get him close close close he thought i mustn’t try for the head i must get the heart “be calm and strong old man” he said on the next circle the fish’s beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat on the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside he had rigged his harpoon long before and it s coil of light rope was in a round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow the fish was coming in on his circle no w calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail moving the old man pulled on him all that he co uld to bring him closer for just a moment the fish turned a little on his side then he straightened himself and began another circle “i moved him” the old man said “i moved him then” he felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could i moved him he thought maybe this time i can get him over pull hands he thought hold up legs last for me head last for me yo u never went this time i’ll pull him over but when he put all of his effort on starting it we ll out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all hi s strength the fish pulled pa rt way over and then righted himself and swam away “fish” the old man said “fish you are going to have to die anyway do you have to kill me too” that way nothing is accomplished he thou ght his mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now i must get him alongside this time he thought i am not good for many more turns yes you are he told himself you’re good for ever asiaingcom on the next turn he nearly had him but again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away you are killing me fish the old man though t but you have a ri ght to never have i seen a greater or more beautiful or a ca lmer or more noble th ing than you brother come on and kill me i do not care who kills who now you are getting confused in the head he thought you mu s t k e e p y o u r h e a d clear keep your head clear and know how to su ffer like a man or a fish he thought “clear up head” he said in a voice he could hardly hear “clear up” twice more it was the same on the tu rns i do not know the old man thought he had been on the point of feeling himself go each time i do not know but i will try it once more he tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish the fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air i’ll try it again the old man promised althou gh his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes he tr ied it again and it was the same so he thought and he felt himself going before he started i will try it once again he took all his pain and what was left of his strength an d his long gone pride and he put it against the fish’s agony and the fish came over onto hi s side and swam gently on his side his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat long deep wide silver and barred with purp le and interminable in the water the old man dropped the line an d put his foot on it and lift ed the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down wi th all his strength and more strength he had just summoned into the fish’s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man’s chest he felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it t h e n t h e f i s h c a m e a l i v e w i t h h i s d e a t h i n h i m a n d r o s e h i g h o u t o f t h e w a t e r showing all his great length and width and all hi s power and his beauty he seemed to hang in the air above the old man in the skiff then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man an d over all of the skiff the old man felt faint and sick and he coul d not see well but he cleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly thro ugh his raw hands and when he could see he saw the fish was on his back with his silv er belly up the shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish’s shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart first it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep then it spread like a cloud the fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves the old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and hid his head on his hands “keep my head dear” he said against the wood of the bow “i am a tired old man but i have killed this fish which is my brot her and now i must do the slave work” now i must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside he thought even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out this skiff would never asiaingcom hold him i must prepare everything then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home h e s t a r t e d t o p u l l t h e f i s h i n t o h a v e h i m a l o n g s i d e s o t h a t h e c o u l d p a s s a l i n e through his gills and out his mo uth and make his head fast al ongside the bow i want to see him he thought and to touc h and to feel him he is my fortune he thought but that is not why i wish to feel him i think i felt his heart he thought when i pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time bring him in now and make him fa st and get the noose around his tail and another around hi s middle to bind him to the skiff “get to work old man” he sa id he took a very sma ll drink of the water “there is very much slave work to be do ne now that the fight is over” he looked up at the sky and th en out to his fish he looked at the sun carefully it is not much more than noon he thought and th e trade wind is rising the lines all mean nothing now the boy and i will sp lice them when we are home “come on fish” he said bu t the fish did not come instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff upon to him when he was even with him and had the fi sh’s head against th e bow he could not believe his size but he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt passed it through the fish’s gills and out his jaws made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow he cut the rope th en and went astern to noose the tail the fish had turned silver from his or iginal purple and silver and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail they were w ider than a man’s hand with his fingers spread and the fish’s eye looked as detached as th e mirrors in a periscop e or as a saint in a procession “it was the only way to kill him” th e old man said he was feeling better since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear he’s over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is he though t maybe much more if he dresses out twothirds of that at thirty cents a pound “i need a pencil for that” he said “my he ad is not that clear but i think the great dimaggio would be proud of me today i had no bone spurs but the hands and the back hurt truly” i wonder what a bone spur is he thought maybe we have them without knowing of it he made the fish fast to bow and stern an d to the middle thwart he was so big it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside he cut a piece of line and tied the fish’s lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible then he stepped the mast and with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged the patched sail drew the boat be gan to move and half lying in the stern he sailed southwest he did not need a compass to tell him wher e southwest was he o nly needed the feel asiaingcom of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail i better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get so mething to eat and drink for th e moisture but he could not find a spoon and his sardines were rotten so he hooked a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that th e small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff there were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas the old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails they were very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good the old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had eaten the shrimps the skiff was sail ing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm he could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back agains t the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream at one time when he was feelin g so badly toward the end he had thought perhaps it was a dream then when he had se en the fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell he was sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it then he could not see well although now he saw as well as ever now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back we re no dream the hands cure quickly he thought i bled them clean an d the salt water will heal th em the dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer th at there is all i must do is keep the head clear the hands have done their work and we sa il well with his mouth shut and his tail st raight up and down we sail like brothers then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought is he bringing me in or am i bringi ng him in if i were to wing him behind there would be no question nor if th e fish were in the skiff with all dignity gone there would be no question either but they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man thought let him bring me in if it pleases him i am only be tter than him through trickery and he meant me no harm they sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head clear there were hi gh cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night the old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true it was an hour before the first shark hit him the shark was not an accident he had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea he had come up so fast and absolutely without caut ion that he broke th e surface of the blue water and was in the sun then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent an d started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had taken sometimes he lost the scent but he would pick it up again or have just a trace of it and he swam fast and hard on the course he was a very big make shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everyt hing about him was beau tiful except his jaws his back was as blue as a sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome he was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast just under the surf ace with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering inside the closed doub le lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards they were not the ordinary pyramidshaped teeth of most asiaingcom sharks they were shaped like a man’s fingers when they are crisped like claws they were nearly as long as the fingers of the old ma n and they had razorsharp cutting edges on both sides this was a fish built to feed on all the fi shes in the sea that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy now he speeded up as he smelled the fresher scent and his bl ue dorsal fin cut the water when the old man saw him coming he knew th at this was a shark th at had no fear at all and would do exactly what he wished he prepared th e harpoon and made the rope fast while he watched the shark come on the ro pe was short as it la cked what he had cut away to lash the fish the old man’s head was clear and good now an d he was full of resolution but he had little hope it was too good to last he thought he took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in it might as well ha ve been a dream he thought i cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe i can get him dentuso he thought bad luck to your mother the shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking ch op of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail the shark’s head was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear th e noise of skin and flesh ripp ing on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the shark’s he ad at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose there were no such lines there was only the he avy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking thrusting allswallowing jaws but that was th e location of the brain and the old man hit it he hit it with his blood mushed hands driv ing a good harpoon with all his strength he hit it without hope but with reso lution and complete malignancy the shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once again wrapping hi mself in two loops of the rope the old man knew that he was dead but the shark would no t accept it then on his back with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking the shark plowed over th e water as a speedboat does the water was white where his tail beat it and threequarters of his body was clea r above the water when the rope came taut shivered and then snappe d the shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him then he went down very slowly “he took about forty pounds” the old man said aloud he took my harpoon too and all the rope he thought and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others he did not like to look at the fi sh anymore since he had been mutilated when the fish had been hit it was as though he himself were hit but i killed the shark that hit my fish he thought and he was the bigg est dentuso that i have ever seen and god knows that i have seen big ones it was too good to last he thought i wish it had been a dream now and that i had never hooked the fish an d was alone in bed on the newspapers “but man is not made for defeat” he said “a man can be destroyed but not defeated” i am sorry that i killed the fish though he thought now the bad time is coming and i do not even have the harpoon th e dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent but i was more inte lligent than he was perhaps not he thought perhaps i was only better armed asiaingcom “don’t think old man” he said aloud “sail on this course and take it when it comes but i must think he thought because it is all i have left that and baseball i wonder how the great dimaggio would have liked the way i hit him in the brain it was no great thing he thought any man could do it but do you th ink my hands were as great a h a nd i c a p a s t h e b o n e s p u r s i c a n n ot k n o w i n ev e r h a d a n y th i ng w r o n g w i th m y h eel except the time the sting ray stung it wh en i stepped on him when swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain “think about something cheerful old man ” he said “every minute now you are closer to home you sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds” he knew quite well the pattern of what coul d happen when he re ached the inner part of the current but there was nothing to be done now “yes there is” he said aloud “i can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars” so he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot “now” he said “i am still an old man but i am not unarmed” the breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well he watched only the forward part of the fish and some of his hope returned it is silly not to hope he thought beside s i believe it is a sin do not think about sin he thought there are enough pr oblems now without si n also i have no understanding of it i have no understanding of it and i am not sure that i believe in it perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish i suppose it was even though i did it to keep me alive and feed many people but then everything is a sin do not think about sin it is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it let them think about it you were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish san pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great dimaggio but he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was nothing to read and he did not have a radio he thought much and he kept on thinking about sin you did not kill the fi sh only to keep alive and to sell for food he thought you killed him for pride and because you are a fi sherman you loved him when he was alive and you loved him after if you love him it is not a sin to kill him or is it more “you think too much old man” he said aloud but you enjoyed killing the dentuso he though t he lives on the live fish as you do he is not a scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are he is beautiful and noble and knows no fear of anything “i killed him in selfdefense” the old ma n said aloud “and i killed him well” besides he thought everything kills everyt hing else in some way fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive the boy keeps me alive he thought i must not deceive asiaingcom myself too much he leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut him he chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste it was firm and juicy like meat but it was not red there wa s no stringiness in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market bu t there was no way to keep its scent out of the water and the old man knew that a very had time was coming the breeze was steady it had backed a little further into the northeast and he knew that meant that it would not fa ll off the old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship there were only the flying fish that went up from his bow sailing away to ei ther side and the yellow patches of gulf weed he could not even see a bird he had sailed for two hours restin g in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit of the meat from the marlin trying to rest and to be strong when he saw the first of the two sharks “ay” he said aloud there is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make invo luntarily feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood “galanos” he said aloud he had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first and had identified them as shovelnosed sh arks by the brown triangular fin and the sweeping movements of the tail they had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were losing and fi nding the scent in their excitement but they were closing all the time the old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller then he took up the oar with the knife lashed to it he lifted it as lightl y as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them he closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come he could see their wide flattened shovelpoint ed heads now and their white tipped wide pectoral fins they were hateful sharks bad smelling scavengers as well as killers and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat it was these sharks that would cut the turtle s’ legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the surface and they would hit a man in the water if they were hungry even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him “ay” the old man said “galanos come on galanos” they came but they did not come as the mako had come one turned and went out of sight under the skiff and th e old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish the other watched the old man with his slitted ye llow eyes and then came in fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten the line showed clearly on the top of his brow n head and back where the brain joined the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the juncture withdrew it and drove it in again into the shark’s yellow catli ke eyes the shark let go of the fish and slid down swallowing what he had taken as he died the skiff was still shaking with the destruct ion the other shark was doing to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so th at the skiff would swing broadside and bring asiaingcom the shark out from under when he saw the sh ark he leaned over the side and punched at him he hit only meat and the hide was set ha rd and he barely got the knife in the blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too but the shark came up fast with his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flattopped head as his nose came out of water and lay against the fish the old man withdrew the blade and punched the shark exactly in the same spot again he stil l hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and the old man stabbed him in his left eye the shark still hung there “no” the old man said and he drove the blade between th e vertebrae and the brain it was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever th e old man reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark’s jaws to op en them he twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said “go on galano slide down a mile deep go see your friend or maybe it’s your mother” the old man wiped the blade of his knife an d laid down the oar then he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course “they must have taken a quarter of hi m and of the best meat” he said aloud “i wish it were a dream and that i had never hooked him i’m sorry about it fish it makes everything wrong” he stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now drained of blood and awash he looked the colour of the si lver backing of a minor and his stripes still showed “i shouldn’t have gone out so far fish” he said “neither for you nor for me i’m sorry fish” now he said to himself look to the lashin g on the knife and see if it has been cut then get your hand in order becaus e there still is more to come “i wish i had a stone for the knife” the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt “i should ha ve brought a stone” you should have brought many things he thought but you did not brin g them old man now is no ti me to think of what you do not have think of what you can do with what there is “you give me much good coun sel” he said aloud “i’m tire d of it” he held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward “god knows how much that last one took” he said “but she’s much ligh ter now” he did not want to think of the mutilated underside of the fish he knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and th at the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea he was a fish to keep a man all winter he thought don’t think of that just rest and try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him the blood smell from my hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water besides they do not bleed much there is nothing cut that means anyt hing the bleeding may keep the left from cramping what can i think of now he thought noth ing i must think of nothing and wait for asiaingcom the next ones i wish it had really been a dream he thou ght but who knows it might have turned out well the next shark that came was a single shove lnose he came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wi de that you could put your head in it the old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar don into his brain but the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped the old man settled himself to steer he did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the water sh owing first lifesize then small then tiny that always fascinated the old man but he did not even watch it now “i have the gaff now” he sa id “but it will do no goo d i have the two oars and the tiller and the short club” now they have beaten me he th ought i am too old to club sharks to death but i will try it as long as i have the oars and the short club and the tiller he put his hands in the water again to soak them it was getting la te in the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky there was more wind in the sky than there had been and soon he hoped that he would see land “you’re tired old man” he sa id “you’re tired inside” the sharks did not hit him agai n until just before sunset the old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in the water they were not even quartering on the scent they were he aded straight for the skiff swimming side by side he ja mmed the tiller made the sheet fast and reached under the stem for the club it was an oar handle from a broken oar sa wed off to about two and a half feet in length he could only use it effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his right hand flexing his hand on it as he watche d the sharks come they were both galanos i must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head he thought the two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and s i n k t h e m i n t o t h e s i l v e r s i d e o f t h e f i s h he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shar k’s broad head he felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down but he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish the other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide the old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws he swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose the old man swung the club asiaingcom down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness “come on galano” the old ma n said “come in again” the shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws he hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club this time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place wh ile the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish the old man watched for him to come agai n but neither shark showed then he saw one on the surface swimming in circles he did not se e the fin of the other i could not expect to kill them he thought i could have in my time but i have hurt them both badly and neither on e can feel very good if i co uld have used a bat with two hands i could have killed the first one surely ev en now he thought he did not want to look at the fish he knew that half of him had been destroyed the sun had gone down while he had be en in the fight with the sharks “it will be dark soon” he s aid “then i should see th e glow of havana if i am too far to the eastward i will see the lights of one of the new beaches” i cannot be too far out now he thought i hope no one has been too worried there is only the boy to worry of co urse but i am sure he would have confidence many of the older fishermen will worry many others t oo he thought i live in a good town he could not talk to the fish anymore beca use the fish had been ruined too badly then something came into his head “half fish” he said “fish that you were i am sorry that i went too far out i ruined us both but we have killed many sharks you and i and ruined many others how many did you ever kill old fish you do not have that spear on your head for nothing” he liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming free i should have chopped the bill off to fi ght them with he thought but there was no hatchet and then there was no knife but if i had and could have lashed it to an oar butt what a we apon then we might have fought them together what will you do now if they come in the night what can you do “fight them” he said “i’ll fight them until i die” but in the dark now an d no glow showing and no li ghts and only the wind and the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was alre ady dead he put his two hands together and felt the palms they were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them he leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead his shoulders told him i have all those prayers i prom ised if i caught the fish he thought but i am too tired asiaingcom to say them now i better get the sa ck and put it over my shoulders he lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky i have h a l f o f hi m h e t h o ugh t ma y be i ’ l l h ave th e luck to bring the forward half in i should have some luck no he said you violated your luck when you went too far outside “don’t be silly” he said aloud “and keep awake and st eer you may have much luck yet” “i’d like to buy some if there’s any place they sell it” he said what could i buy it with he asked himself could i buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands “you might” he said “you tried to buy it with eightyfou r days at sea they nearly sold it to you too” i must not think nonsense he thought luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her i would take some thou gh in any form and pay what they asked i wish i could see the glow from the lights he thought i wish too many things but that is the thing i wish for now he tried to settle mo re comfortably to steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead he saw the reflected glare of th e lights of the city at what must have been around ten o ’ cl ock a t n i g h t t h ey w e re o nly perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises then they were steady to see across the ocea n which was rough now with the increasing breeze he steered inside of the gl ow and he thought that now soon he must hit the edge of the stream now it is over he thought they will prob ably hit me again but what can a man do against them in the dark without a weapon he was stiff and sore now and his wounds an d all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the cold of the night i hope i do not have to fight again he thought i hope so much i do not have to fight again but by midnight he foug ht and this time he knew the fight was useless they came in a pack and he could only see the line s in the water that thei r fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish he clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of the skif f a s t h e y t o o k h o l d b e l o w h e c l u b b e d desperately at what he could o nly feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it was gone he jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it holding it in both hands and driving it down again and again but they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the other and together te aring off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more one came finally against the head itself and he knew that it was over he swung the tiller across the shark’s head wh ere the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish’s head which would not tear he swung it once and twice and again he heard the tiller asiaingcom break and he lunged at the shar k with the splintered butt he felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in agai n the shark let go and rolled away that was the last shark of the pack that came there was nothing more for them to eat the old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth it was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment but th ere was not much of it he spat into the ocean and said “eat that ga lanos and make a dream you’ve killed a man” he knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the stern and found the jagged end of the tiller woul d fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer he settled the sack around his shoulders and put th e skiff on her course he sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind he was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and as intelligently as he could in the night shar ks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table the old ma n paid no attention to them an d did not pay any attention to anything except steering he only noticed how lightly and bow well the skiff sailed now there was no great we ight beside her she’s good he thought she is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller that is easily replaced he could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies along th e shore he knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home the wind is our friend anyway he thou ght then he added sometimes and the great sea with our friends and our enemies an d bed he thought bed is my friend just bed he thought bed will be a great thing it is easy when you are beaten he thought i never knew how easy it was an d what beat you he thought “nothing” he said aloud “i went out too far” when he sailed into the little harbour the li ghts of the terrace we re out and he knew everyone was in bed the breeze had risen stea dily and was blowing strongly now it was quiet in the harbour though an d he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks there was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could then he stepped out and made he r fast to a rock he unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it then he shouldered the mast and started to climb it was then he kn ew the depth of his tiredness he stopped for a moment and looked back and saw in the reflec tion from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well behind the skiff’s stern he saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between he started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder he tried to get up but it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at the road a cat passed on the far side going about its business and the old man watched it then he just watched the road asiaingcom finally he put the mast down and stood up he picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder and started up the road he had to sit down five times before he reached his shack inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall in the dark he found a water bottle and took a drink then he lay down on the bed he pulled the blanket over his shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and th e palms of his hands up he was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning it was blowing so hard that the driftingboats would not be go ing out and the boy had slept late and then come to the old man’s shack as he had come each morning the boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw the old man’s hands and he started to cry he went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the ro ad he was crying many fishermen were around the skiff lookin g at what was lashed beside it and one was in the water his trousers rolled up meas uring the skeleton with a length of line the boy did not go down he had been there before an d one of the fishermen was looking after the skiff for him “how is he” one of the fishermen shouted “sleeping” the boy called he did not care th at they saw him crying “let no one disturb him” “he was eighteen feet from nose to tail” the fisherman who was meas uring him called “i believe it” the boy said he went into the terrace and asked for a can of coffee “hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it” “anything more” “no afterwards i will see what he can eat” “what a fish it was” the proprietor said “there has never been such a fish those were two fine fish you took ye sterday too” “damn my fish” th e boy said and he started to cry again “do you want a drink of any kind” the proprietor asked “no” the boy said “tell them not to bother santiago i’ll be back” “tell him how sorry i am” “thanks” the boy said the boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man’s shack and sat by him until he woke once it looked as though he were waking but he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had gone across the road to bo rrow some wood to heat the coffee finally the old man woke “don’t sit up ” the boy said “drink this” asiaingcom he poured some of the coffee in a glass the old man took it and drank it “they beat me manolin” he sa id “they truly beat me” “he didn’t beat you not the fish” “no truly it was afterwards” “pedrico is looking after the skiff and th e gear what do you want done with the head” “let pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps” “and the spear” “you keep it if you want it” “i want it” the boy said “now we must make our plans about the other things” “did they search for me” “of course with coast gu ard and with planes” “the ocean is very big and a skiff is sma ll and hard to see” the old man said he noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to in stead of speaking only to himself and to the sea “i mi ssed you” he said “what did you catch” “one the first day one the second and two the third” “very good” “now we fish together again” “no i am not lucky i am not lucky anymore” “the hell with luck” the boy said “i’ll bring the luck with me” “what will your family say” “i do not care i caught two yesterday but we will fish together now for i still have much to learn” “we must get a good killing lance and alwa ys have it on board you can make the blade from a spring leaf from an old ford we can grind it in guanabacoa it should be sharp and not tempered so it will break my knife broke” “i’ll get another knife and have the spring ground” how many days of heav y brisa have we” “maybe three maybe more” “i will have everything in order” the boy said “you get your hands well old man” asiaingcom “i know how to care for them in the night i spat something strange and felt something in my chest was broken” “get that well too” the boy said “lie down old man and i will bring you your clean shirt and something to eat” “bring any of the pape rs of the time that i was gone” the old man said “you must get well fast for there is much that i can learn and you can teach me everything how much did you suffer” “p lenty” the old man said “i’ll bring the food and the papers” the b oy said “rest well ol d man i will bring stuff from the drugstore for your hands” “don’t forget to tell pedrico the head is his” “no i will remember” as the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again that afternoon there was a party of tourists at the terrace and looking down in the water among the empty beer ca ns and dead barracudas a wo man saw a great long white spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour “what’s that” she asked a waiter and pointe d to the long backbone of the great fish that was now just garbage waitin g to go out with the tide “tiburon” the waiter said “shark” he was meaning to explain what had happened “i didn’t know sharks had such ha ndsome beautifully formed tails” “i didn’t either” her male companion said up the road in his shack the old man was sleeping again he was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watc hing him the old man was dreaming about the lions
