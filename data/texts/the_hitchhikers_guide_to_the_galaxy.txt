the history of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is now so complicated that every time i tell it i contradict myself and whenever i do get it right im misquoted so the publication of this omnibus edition seemed like a good opportunity to set the record straight ʹ or at least firmly crooked anything that is put down wrong here is as far as im concerned wrong for good the idea for the title first cropped up while i was lying drunk in a field in innsbruck austria in not particularly drunk just the sort of drunk you get when you have a couple of stiff gössers after not having eaten for two days straight on account of being a penniless hitchhiker we are talking of a mild inability to stand up i was traveling with a copy of the hitch hiker s guide to eu rope by ken walsh a very battered copy that i had borrowed from someone in fact since this was and i still have the book it must count as stolen by now i didnt have a copy of europe on five dollars a day as it then was because i wasnt in that financial league night was beginning to fall on my field as it spun lazily underneath me i was wondering where i could go that was cheaper than innsbruck revolved less and didnt do the sort of things to me that innsbruck had done to me that afternoon what had happened was this i had been walking through the town trying to find a particular address and being thoroughly lost i stopped to ask for directions from a man in the street i knew this mightnt be easy because i dont speak german but i was still surprised to discover just how much difficulty i was having communicating with this particular man gradually the truth dawned on me as we struggled in vain to understand each other that of all the people in innsbruck i could have stopped to ask the one i had picked did not speak english did not speak french and was also deaf and dumb with a series of sincerely apologetic hand movements i disentangled myself and a few minutes later on another street i stopped and asked another man who also turn ed out to be deaf and dumb which was when i bought the beers i ventured back onto the street i tried again when the third man i spoke to turned out to be deaf and dumb and also blind i began to feel a terrible weight settling on my shoulders whereve r i looked the trees and buildings took on dark and menacing aspects i pulled my coat tightly around me and hurried lurching down the street whipped by a sudden gusting wind i bumped into someone and stammered an apology but he was deaf and dumb and un able to understand me the sky loured the pavement seemed to tip and spin if i hadnt happened then to duck down a side street and pass a hotel where a convention for the deaf was being held there is every chance that my mind would have cracked complete ly and i would have spent the rest of my life writing the sort of books for which kafka became famous and dribbling as it is i went to lie in a field along with my hitch hikers guide to europe and when the stars came out it occurred to me that if only someone would write a hitchhikers guide to the galaxy as well then i for one would be off like a shot having had this thought i promptly fell asleep and forgot about it for six years i went to cambridge university i took a number of baths ʹand a degr ee in english i worried a lot about girls and what had happened to my bike later i became a writer and worked on a lot of things that were almost incredibly successful but in fact just failed to see the light of day other writers will know what i mean my pet project was to write something that would combine comedy and science fiction and it was this obsession that drove me into deep debt and despair no one was interested except finally one man a bbc radio producer named simon brett who had had the s ame idea comedy and science fiction although simon only produced the first episode before leaving the bbc to concentrate on his own writing he is best known in the united stares for his excellent charles paris detective novels i owe him an immense deb t of gratitude for simply getting the thing to happen in the first place he was succeeded by the legendary geoffrey perkins in its original form the show was going to be rather different i was feeling a little disgruntled with the world at the time and had put together about six different plots each of which ended with the destruction of the world in a different way and for a different reason it was to be called the ends of the earth while i was filling in the details of the first plot ʹ in which the earth was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace express route ʹ i realized that i needed to have someone from another planet around to tell the reader what was going on to give the story the context it needed so i had to work out who he was an d what he was doing on the earth i decided to call him ford prefect this was a joke that missed american audiences entirely of course since they had never heard of the rather oddly named little car and many thought it was a typing error for perfect i explained in the text that the minimal research my alien character had done before arriving on this planet had led him to think that this name would be nicely inconspicuous he had simply mistaken the dominant life form so how would such a mistake arise i remembered when i used to hitchhike through europe and would often find that the information or advice that came my way was out of date or misleading in some way most of it of course just came from stories of other peoples travel experiences at that point the title the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy suddenly popped back into my mind from wherever it had been hiding all this time ford i decided would be a researcher who collected data for the guide as soon as i started to develop this particular notion it moved inexorably to the center of the story and the rest as the creator of the original ford prefect would say is bunk the story grew in the most convoluted way as many people will be surprised to learn writing episodically meant that when i finished one episode i had no idea about what the next one would contain when in the twists and turns of the plot some event suddenly seemed to illuminate things that had gone before i was as surprised as anyone else i think that the bbc s attitude toward the show while it was in production was very similar to that which macbeth had toward murdering people ʹ initial doubts followed by cautious enthusiasm and then greater and greater alarm at the sheer scale of the undertaking and still n o end in sight reports that geoffrey and i and the sound engineers were buried in a subterranean studio for weeks on end taking as long to produce a single sound effect as other people took to produce an entire series and stealing everybody elses studi o time in which to do so were all vigorously denied but absolutely true the budget of the series escalated to the point that it could have practically paid for a few seconds of dallas if the show hadnt worked the first episode went out on bbc rad io at pm on wednesday march in a huge blaze of no publicity at all bats heard it the odd dog barked after a couple of weeks a letter or two trickled in so ʹ someone out there had listened people i balked to seemed to like marvin t he paranoid android whom i had written in as a one ʹ scene joke and had only developed further at geoffreys insistence then some publishers became interested and i was commissioned by pan books in england to write up the series in book form after a lot of procrastination and hiding and inventing excuses and having baths i managed to get about two ­‐thirds of it done at this point they said very pleasantly and politely that i had already passed ten deadlines so would i please just finish the page i was on and let them have the damn thing meanwhile i was busy trying to write another series and was also writing and script editing the tv series dr who because while it was all very pleasant to have your own radio series especially one that somebo dy had written in to say they had heard it didnt exactly buy you lunch so that was more or less the situation when the book the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was published in england in september and appeared on the sunday times mass market best­‐seller list at number one and just stayed there clearly somebody had been listening this is where things start getting complicated and this is what i was asked in writing this introduction to explain the guide has appeared in so many forms ʹ book s radio a television series records and soon to be a major motion picture ʹ each time with a different story line that even its most acute followers have become baffled at times here then is a breakdown of the different versions ʹ not including the va rious stage versions which havent been seen in the states and only complicate the matter further the radio series began in england in march the first series consisted of six programs or fits as they were called fits thru easy later that year one more episode was recorded and broadcast commonly known as the christmas episode it contained no reference of any kind to christmas it was called the christmas episode because it was first broadcast on december which is not christmas day after this things began to get increasingly complicated in the fall of the first hitchhiker book was published in england called the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy it was a substantially expanded version of the first four episodes of the radio series in which some of the characters behaved in entirely different ways and others behaved in exactly the same ways but for entirely different reasons which amounts to the same thing but saves rewriting the dialogue at roughly the same time a double record album was released which was by contrast a slightly contracted version of the first four episodes of the radio series these were not the recordings that were originally broadcast but wholly new recordings of substantially the same scripts this was done because we had used music off gramophone records as incidental music for the series which is fine on radio but makes commercial release impossible in january five new episodes of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy were broadcast on bbc radio all in one week bringing the total number to twelve episodes in the fall of the second hitchhiker book was published in england around the s ame time that harmony books published the first book in the united states it was a very substantially reworked reedited and contracted version of episodes s and in that order of the radio series the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy in case that seemed too straightforward the book was called the restaurant at the end of the universe because it included the material from radio episodes of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy which was set in a restaurant called milliways ot herwise known as the restaurant at the end of the universe at roughly the same time a second record album was made featuring a heavily rewritten and expanded version of episodes and of the radio series this record album was also called the restaura nt at the end of the universe meanwhile a series of six television episodes of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was made by the bbc and broadcast in january this was based more or less on the first six episodes of the radio series in othe r words it incorporated most of the book the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and the second half of the book the restaurant at be end of the universe therefore though it followed the basic structure of the radio series it incorporated revisions from the books which didnt in january harmony books published the restaurant at the end of the universe in the united states in the summer of a third hitchhiker book was published simultaneously in england and the united states called life the universe and everything this was not based on anything that had already been heard or seen on radio or television in fact it flatly contradicted episod es i and of the radio series these episodes of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy you will remember had already been incorporated in revised form in the book called the restaurant at the end of the universe at this point i went t o america to write a film screenplay which was completely inconsistent with most of what has gone on so far and since that film was then delayed in the making a rumor currently has it that filming will start shortly before the last trump i wrote a fourth and last book in the trilogy so long and thanks for all the fish this was published in britain and the usa in the fall of and it effectively contradicted everything to date up to and including itself as if this all were not enough i wrote a c omputer game for infocom called the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy which bore only fleeting resemblances to anything that had previously gone under that title and in collaboration with geoffrey perkins assembled the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy th e original radio scripts published in england and the usa in now this was an interesting venture the book is as the title suggests a collection of all the radio scripts as broadcast and it is therefore the only example of one hitchhiker public ation accurately and consistently reflecting another i feel a little uncomfortable with this ʹ which is why the introduction to that book was written after the final and definitive one you are now reading and of course flatly contradicts it people oft en ask me how they can leave the planet so i have prepared some brief notes how to leave the planet i phone nasa their phone number is ­‐ explain that its very important that you get away as soon as possible if

and a sofa preface far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yell ow sun orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety ­‐two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape ­‐descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea this plan et has ʹ or rather had ʹ a problem which was this most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time many solutions were suggested for this problem but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of pape r which is odd because on the whole it wasnt the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy and so the problem remained lots of the people were mean and most of them were miserable even the ones with digital watches many were increasingly of th e opinion that theyd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place and some said that even the trees had been a bad move and that no one should ever have left the oceans and then one thursday nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place this time it was right it would work and no one would have to get nailed to anything sadly however before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred an d the idea was lost forever this is not her story but it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences it is also the story of a book a book called the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy ʹ not an earth book never published on earth and until the terrible catastrophe occurred never seen or heard of by any earthman nevertheless a wholly remarkable book in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publi shing houses of ursa minor ʹ of which no earthman had ever heard either not only is it a wholly remarkable book it is also a highly successful one ʹ more popular than the celestial home care omnibus better selling than fifty more things to do in zero g ravity and more controversial than oolon colluphids trilogy of philosophical blockbusters where god went wrong some more of gods greatest mistakes and who is this god person anyway in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the outer eastern rim of the galaxy the hitch hikers guide has already supplanted the great encyclopedia galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal or at least wildly inaccurate it scores over the older more pedestrian work in two important respects first it is slightly cheaper and secondly it has the words dont panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover but the story of this terrible stupid thursday the story of its extraordinary consequences and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply it begins with a house chapter the h ouse stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village it stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of west country farmland not a remarkable house by any means ʹ it was about thirty years old squattish squarish made of brick and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye the only person for whom the house was in any way special was arthur dent and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in he had lived in it for about three years ever since he had moved out of london because it made him nervous and irritable he was about thirty as well dark haired and never quite at ease with himself the thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people alw ays used to ask him what he was looking so worried about he worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought it was too ʹ most of his friends worked in advertising it hadnt properly registered with arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an bypass instead at eight oclock on thursday morning arthur didnt feel very good he woke up blearily got up wandered blearily round his room opened a window saw a bu lldozer found his slippers and stomped off to the bathroom to wash toothpaste on the brush ʹ so scrub shaving mirror ʹ pointing at the ceiling he adjusted it for a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window properly adjust ed it reflected arthur dents bristles he shaved them off washed dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth kettle plug fridge milk coffee yawn the word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with the bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one he stared at it yellow he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of w ater and another he began to suspect that he was hung over why was he hung over had he been drinking the night before he supposed that he must have been he caught a glint in the shaving mirror yellow he thought and stomped on to the bedroom he stood and thought the pub he thought oh dear the pub he vaguely remembered being angry angry about something that seemed important hed been telling people about it telling people about it at great length he rather suspected his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other peoples faces something about a new bypass he had just found out about it had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it ridiculous he took a swig of water it would sort itself o ut hed decided no one wanted a bypass the council didnt have a leg to stand on it would sort itself out god what a terrible hangover it had earned him though he looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror he stuck out his tongue yellow he though t the word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path mr l prosser was as they say only h uman in other words he was a carbon ­‐based life form descended from an ape more specifically he was forty fat and shabby and worked for the local council curiously enough though he didnt know it he was also a direct male ­‐line descendant of genghis kh an though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible mongoloid characteristics and the only vestiges left in mr l prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilect ion for little fur hats he was by no means a great warrior in fact he was a nervous worried man today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job ʹ which was to see that arthur dents house got cleared out of the way before the day was out come off it mr dent he said you cant win you know you cant lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely he tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but th ey just wouldnt do it arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him im game he said well see who rusts first im afraid youre going to have to accept it said mr prosser gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head this bypass has got to be built and its going to be built first ive heard of it said arthur whys it going to be buil t mr prosser shook his finger at him for a bit then stopped and put it away again what do you mean whys it got to be built he said its a bypass youve got to build bypasses bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point a to point b very fast whilst other people dash from point b to point a very fast people living at point c being a point directly in between are often given to wonder whats so great about point a that so many people of point b are so keen to get there and whats so great about point b that so many people of point a are so keen to get there they often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be mr prosser wanted to be at point d point d wasnt anywhere in particular it was just any convenient point a very long way from points a b and c he would have a nice little cottage at point d with axes over the door and spend a pleasant amount of time at point e which would be the nearest pub to point d his wi fe of course wanted climbing roses but he wanted axes he didnt know why ʹ he just liked axes he flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers he shifted his weight from foot to foot but it was equally uncomfortable on each obvious ly somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to god it wasnt him mr prosser said you were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time you know appropriate time hooted arthur appropriate time the fi rst i knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday i asked him if hed come to clean the windows and he said no hed come to demolish the house he didnt tell me straight away of course oh no first he wiped a couple of windows and char ged me a fiver then he told me but mr dent the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine month oh yes well as soon as i heard i went straight round to see them yesterday afternoon you hadnt exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you i mean like actually telling anybody or anything but the plans were on display on display i eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them thats the display department with a torch ah well the lights had probably gone so had the stairs but look you found the notice didnt you yes said arthur yes i did it was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door sayin g beware of the leopard a cloud passed overhead it cast a shadow over arthur dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud it cast a shadow over arthur dents house mr prosser frowned at it its not as if its a particularly nice house he said im sorry but i happen to like it youll like the bypass oh shut up said arthur dent shut up and go away and take your bloody bypass with you you havent got a leg to stand on and you know it mr prossers mouth opened and clo sed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of arthur dents house being consumed with fire and arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protr uding from his back mr prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous he stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together mr dent he said hello yes said arthur some factual information for you have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if i just let it roll straight over you how much said arthur none at all said mr prosser and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was fil led with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him by a curious coincidence none at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape ­‐descendant arthur dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape but was in fact from a small plan et in the vicinity of betelgeuse and not from guildford as he usually claimed arthur dent had never ever suspected this this friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen earth years previously and he had worked hard to blend himself int o earth society ʹ with it must be said some success for instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor which was plausible enough he had made one careless blunder though because he had skimped a bit on his preparator y research the information he had gathered had led him to choose the name ford prefect as being nicely inconspicuous he was not conspicuously tall his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome his hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples his skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose there was something very slightly odd about him but it was difficult to say what it was perhaps it was that his eyes didnt blink often enough and when you talked to him fo r any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck he struck most of the friends he had made on ear th as an eccentric but a harmless one ʹ an unruly boozer with some oddish habits for instance he would often gatecrash university parties get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out sometimes he woul d get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing then he would start guiltily for a moment relax and grin oh just looking for flying saucers he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for green ones he would reply with a wicked grin laugh wildly for a moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks evenings like this usually ended badly ford would get out of his skull on whisky huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didnt matter that much really thereafter stagger ing semi ­‐paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to betelgeuse the policemen would usually say something like dont you think its about time you went off home sir im trying to baby im trying to is what ford invariably replied on these occasions in fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all the reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the betelgeuse trading scouts ford prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the earth ford wished that a fly ing saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them he knew how to see the marvels of the universe for less than thirty altairan dollars a day in fact ford prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy human beings are great adaptors and by lunchtime life in the environs of arthurs house had settled into a steady routine it was arthurs accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasiona l demands to see his lawyer his mother or a good book it was mr prossers accepted role to tackle arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the for the public good talk the march of progress talk the they knocked my house down once you know never l ooked back talk and various other cajoleries and threats and it was the bulldozer drivers accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage the ear th moved slowly in its diurnal course the sun was beginning to dry out the mud arthur lay in a shadow moved across him again hello arthur said the shadow arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see ford prefect standing above him ford hello how are you fine said ford look are you busy am i busy exclaimed arthur well ive just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of because theyll knock my house down if i dont but other than that well no not especially why they dont have sarcasm on betelgeuse and ford pr efect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating he said good is there anywhere we can talk what said arthur dent for a few seconds ford seemed to ignore him and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car then suddenly he squatted down beside arthur weve got to talk he said urgently fine said arthur talk and drink said ford its vitally important that we talk and drink now well go to the pub in the village he looked into the sky again nervous expectant look dont you understand shouted arthur he pointed at prosser that man wants to knock my house down ford glanced at him puzzled well he can do it while youre away cant he he asked but i dont want him t o ah look whats the matter with you ford said arthur nothing nothings the matter listen to me ʹ ive got to tell you the most important thing youve ever heard ive got to tell you now and ive got to tell you in the saloon bar of the h orse and groom but why because you are going to need a very stiff drink ford stared at arthur and arthur was astonished to find that his will was beginning to weaken he didnt realize that this was because of an old drinking game that ford lea rned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of orion beta the game was not unlike the earth game called indian wrestling and was played like this two contestants would sit either side of a table with a glass in front of each of them between them would be placed a bottle of janx spirit as immortalized in that ancient orion mining song oh dont give me none more of that old janx spirit no dont you give me none more of that old janx spirit for my head will fly my tongue will lie my eyes will fry and i may die wont you pour me one more of that sinful old janx spirit each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the gla ss of his opponent ʹ who would then have to drink it the bottle would then be refilled the game would be played again and again once you started to lose you would probably keep losing because one of the effects of janx spirit is to depress telepsych ic power as soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed the final loser would have to perform a forfeit which was usually obscenely biological ford prefect usually played to lose ford stared at arthur who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the horse and groom after all but what about my house he asked plaintively ford looked across to mr prosser and suddenly a wicked thought struck him he wants to knock your house down yes he wants to build and he cant because youre lying in front of the bulldozers yes and im sure we can come to some arrangement said ford excuse me he shouted mr prosser who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not arthur dent constituted a mental health hazard and how much they should get paid if he did looked around he was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that arthur had company yes hello he called has mr dent come to his senses yet can we for the moment called ford assume that he hasnt well sighed mr prosser and can we also assume said ford that hes going to be staying here all day so so all your men a re going to be standing around all day doing nothing could be could be well if youre resigned to doing that anyway you dont actually need him to lie here all the time do you what you dont said ford patiently actually need him he re mr prosser thought about this well no not as such he said not exactly need prosser was worried he thought that one of them wasnt making a lot of sense ford said so if you would just like to take it as read that hes actually her e then he and i could slip off down to the pub for half an hour how does that sound mr prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty that sounds perfectly reasonable he said in a reassuring tone of voice wondering who he was trying to reassure and if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on said ford we can always cover up for you in return thank you very much said mr prosser who no longer knew how to play this at all thank you very much yes thats very kind he frowned then smiled then tried to do both at once failed grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head he could only assume that he had just won so continued ford prefect if you would just like to come over here and lie down what said mr prosser ah im sorry said ford perhaps i hadnt made myself fully clear somebodys got to lie in front of the bulldozers havent they or there wont be anything to stop them driving into mr dents house will there what said mr prosser again its very simple said ford my client mr dent says that he will stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and take over from him what are you talking about said arthur but ford nudged him with his shoe to be quiet you want me said mr prosser spelling out this new thought to himself to come and lie there yes in front of the bulldozer yes instead of mr dent yes in the mud in as you say it the mud as soon as mr prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders this was more like the world as he knew it he sighed in return for which you will take mr dent with you down to the pub thats it said ford thats it exactly mr prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped promise promise said ford he turned to arthur come on he said to him get up and let the man lie down arthur stood up feeling as if he was in a dream ford beckoned to prosser who sadly awkwardly sat down in the mud he felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it the mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes ford looked at him severely and no sneaky knocking down mr dents house whilst hes away alright he said the mere thought growled mr prosser hadnt even begun to speculate he continued settling himself back about the mer est possibility of crossing my mind he saw the bulldozer drivers union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his eyes he was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard h imself he was far from certain about this ʹ his mind seemed to be full of noise horses smoke and the stench of blood this always happened when he felt miserable and put upon and he had never been able to explain it to himself in a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty khan bellowed with rage but mr prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered he began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids bureaucratic cock ­‐ups angry men lying in the mud indecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head ʹ what a day what a day ford prefect knew that it didnt matter a pair of dingos kidneys whether arthurs house got knocked down or not now arthur remained very worried but can we trust him he said myself id trust him to the end of the earth said ford oh yes said arthur and how fars that about twelve minutes away said ford come on i need a drink chapter heres what the encyclopedia galactica has to say about alcohol it says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon ­‐based life forms the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy also mentions alcohol it says that the best drink in existence is the pan galactic gargle blaster it says that the effect of a pan galactic gargle blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick the guide also tells you on which planets the best pan galactic gargle blasters are mixed how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards

heart of the drink sprinkle zamphuor add an olive drink but very carefully the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy sells rather better than the encyclopedia galactica six pints of bitter said ford prefect to the barman of the horse and groom and quickly please the worlds about to end the barman of the horse and groom didnt deserve this sort of treatment he was a dignified old man he pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at ford prefect ford ignored him and stared out of the window so the barman looked instead at arthur who shrugged helplessly and said nothing so the barman said oh yes sir nice weather for it and started pulling pints he tried again going to watch the match this afternoon then ford glanced round at him no no point he said and looked back out of the window whats that foregone conclusion then you reckon sir said the barman arsenal without a chance no no said ford its just that the worlds about to end oh yes sir so you said said the barman looking over his glasses this time at arthur lucky escape for arsenal if it did ford looked back at him genuinely surprised no not really he said he frowned the barman breathed in heavily there y ou are sir six pints he said arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again he turned and smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had heard what was going on none of them had and none of them could understand what he was smilin g at them for a man sitting next to ford at the bar looked at the two men looked at the six pints did a swift burst of mental arithmetic arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them get off said ford theyre ours gi ving him a look that would have an algolian suntiger get on with what it was doing ford slapped a five ­‐pound note on the bar he said keep the change what from a fiver thank you sir youve got ten minutes left to spend it the barman simply decided to walk away for a bit ford said arthur would you please tell me what the hell is going on drink up said ford youve got three pints to get through three pints said arthur at lunchtime the man next to ford grinned and nod ded happily ford ignored him he said time is an illusion lunchtime doubly so very deep said arthur you should send that in to the readers digest theyve got a page for people like you drink up why three pints all of a sudden musc le relaxant youll need it muscle relaxant muscle relaxant arthur stared into his beer did i do anything wrong today he said or has the world always been like this and ive been too wrapped up in myself to notice alright said ford ill try to explain how long have we known each other how long arthur thought er about five years maybe six he said most of it seemed to make some sense at the time alright said ford how would you react if i sa id that im not from guildford after all but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse arthur shrugged in a so ­‐so sort of way i dont know he said taking a pull of beer why ʹ do you think its the sort of thing youre likely t o say ford gave up it really wasnt worth bothering at the moment what with the world being about to end he just said drink up he added perfectly factually the worlds about to end arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile the r est of the pub frowned at him a man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business this must be thursday said arthur musing to himself sinking low over his beer i never could get the hang of thursdays chapter on this particular thursday something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet several somethings in fact several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings huge as office buildings silent as birds they s oared with ease basking in electromagnetic rays from the star sol biding their time grouping preparing the planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence which was just how they wanted it for the moment the huge yellow somethi ngs went unnoticed at goonhilly they passed over cape canaveral without a blip woomera and jodrell bank looked straight through them ʹ which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing theyd been looking for all these years the only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a sub ­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐matic which winked away quietly to itself it nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which ford prefect wore habitually round his neck the contents of ford prefects satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have made any earth physicists eyes pop out of his head which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog ­‐eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top besides the sub­‐etha sens ­‐ o­‐matic and the scripts he had an electronic thumb ʹ a short squat black rod smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end he also had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator this had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million pages could be summoned at a moments notice it looked insanely complicated and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words dont panic printed on it in large friendly letters the other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of ursa minor ʹ the hitchhikers guide to the galax y the reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form an interstellar hitch hiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in beneath that i n ford prefects satchel were a few biros a notepad and a largish bath towel from marks and spencer the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels a towel it says is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have partly it has great practical value ʹ you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of jaglan beta you can lie on it on the brilliant marble ­‐sanded beaches of santraginus v inhaling the heady s ea vapours you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of kakrafoon use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river moth wet it for use in hand ­‐to­‐hand ­‐combat wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal a mindboggingly stupid animal it assumes that if you cant see it it cant see you ʹ daft as a bush but very ravenous you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal and of c ourse dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough more importantly a towel has immense psychological value for some reason if a strag strag non ­‐hitch hiker discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush face flannel soap tin of biscuits flask compass map ball of string gnat spray wet weather gear space suit etc etc furthermore the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have lost what the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy rough it slum it struggle against terrible odds win through and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang as in hey you sass that hoopy ford prefect theres a frood who really knows where his towel is sass know be aware of meet have sex with hoopy really together guy frood really amazingly together guy nestling quietly on top of the towel in ford prefects satchel the sub­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐matic began to wink more quickly miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out at jodrell bank someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea you got a towel with you said ford prefect suddenly to arthur arthur struggling through his third pint looked round at him why what no should i have he had given up being surprised there didnt seem to be any point any longer ford clicked his tongue in irritation drink up he urged at that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the pub through the sound of the jukebox through the sound of the man next to f ord hiccupping over the whisky ford had eventually bought him arthur choked on his beer leapt to his feet whats that he yelped dont worry said ford they havent started yet thank god for that said arthur and relaxed its probably just your house being knocked down said ford drowning his last pint what shouted arthur suddenly fords spell was broken arthur looked wildly around him and ran to the window my god they are theyre knocking my house down what the hell am i doing in the pub ford it hardly makes any difference at this stage said ford let them have their fun fun yelped arthur fun he quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the same thing damn their fun he hoot ed and ran out of the pub furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass he made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime stop you vandals you home wreckers bawled arthur you half crazed visigoths stop will you ford would have to go after him turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts there you are sir said the barman slapping the packets on the bar twenty ­‐eight pence if youd be so kind ford was very kind ʹ he gave the barman another five ­‐pound note and told him to keep the change the barman looked at it and then looked at ford he suddenly shivered he experienced a momentary sensation that he didnt understand because no one on earth had ever experienced it before in moments of great stress every life fo rm that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal this signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth on earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birt hplace which really isnt very far so such signals are too minute to be noticed ford prefect was at this moment under great stress and he was born light years away in the near vicinity of betelgeuse the barman reeled for a moment hit by a shocking incomprehensible sense of distance he didnt know what it meant but he looked at ford prefect with a new sense of respect almost awe are you serious sir he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub you think the worlds going to end yes said ford but this afternoon ford had recovered himself he was at his flippest yes he said gaily in less than two minutes i would estimate the barman couldnt believe the conversation he was having but he couldnt believe the sensation he had just had either isnt there anything we can do about it then he said no nothing said ford stuffing the peanuts into his pockets someone i n the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become the man sitting next to ford was a bit sozzled by now his eyes waved their way up to ford i thought he said that if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something if you like yes said ford thats what they told us in the army said the man and his eyes began the long trek back down to his whisky will that help asked the barman no said ford and gave him a friendly smile excuse me he said ive got to go with a wave he left the pub was silent for a moment longer and then embarrassingly enough the man with the raucous laugh did it again the girl he had dragged along to the pub with him ha d grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour or so and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen ozone and carbon monoxide however when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it the barman cleared his throat he heard himself say last orders please the huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move faster ford knew they were there this wasnt the way he had wanted it running up the lane arthur had nearly reached his house he didnt notice how cold it had suddenly become he didnt notice the wind he didnt notice the sudden irrational squall of rain he didnt notice anything but the cate rpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home you barbarians he yelled ill sue the council for every penny its got ill have you hung drawn and quartered and whipped and boiled until until until youve had enough ford was running after him very fast very very fast and then ill do it again yelled arthur and when ive finished i will take all the little bits and i will jump on them arthur didnt notice that the men were running from the bulldozers he didnt notice that mr prosser was staring hectically into the sky what mr prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds impossibly huge yellow somethings and i will carry on jumping on them yelled arthur s till running until i get blisters or i can think of anything even more unpleasant to do and then arthur tripped and fell headlong rolled and landed flat on his back at last he noticed that something was going on his finger shot upwards what the hells that he shrieked whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness tore the sky apart with mind ­‐buggering noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet i nto your skull another one followed and did the same thing only louder its difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now because they didnt really know what they were doing themselves none of it made a lot of sense ʹ running into houses running out of houses howling noiselessly at the noise all around the world city streets exploded with people cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys deserts and oceans seeming to flatten everything it hit only one man stood and watched the sky stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears he knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his sub ­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐ matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar a nd woken him with a start it was what he had waited for all these years but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart of all the races in all of the galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet earth he thought didnt it just have to be the vogons still he knew what he had to do as the vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he opened his satchel he threw away a copy of joseph and the ama zing technicolor dreamcoat he threw away a copy of godspell he wouldnt need them where he was going everything was ready everything was prepared he knew where his towel was a sudden silence hit the earth if anything it was worse than the noise for a while nothing happened the great ships hung motionless in the air over every nation on earth motionless they hung huge heavy steady in the sky a blasphemy against nature many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at the ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks dont and still nothing happened then there was a slight whisper a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound every hi ­‐fi set in the world every radio every television every cassette recorder every woofer every tweeter every mid ­‐range driver in the world quietly turned itself on every tin can every dust bin every window every car every wine glass every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acous tically perfect sounding board before the earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction the greatest public address system ever built but there was no concert no music no fanfare just a simple message peo ple of earth your attention please a voice said and it was wonderful wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep this is prostetnic vogon jeltz of the galactic hyperspace planning council the voi ce continued as you will no doubt be aware the plans for development of the outlying regions of the galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolitio n the process will take slightly less that two of your earth minutes thank you the pa died away uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of earth the terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them panic sprouted again desperate fleeing panic but t here was nowhere to flee to observing this the vogons turned on their pa again it said theres no point in acting all surprised about it all the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department on alpha c entauri for fifty of your earth years so youve had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and its far too late to start making a fuss about it now the pa fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land the huge ships turned slowly i n the sky with easy power on the underside of each a hatchway opened an empty black space by this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the vogon ships to plead on behalf o f the planet nobody ever heard what they said they only heard the reply the pa slammed back into life again the voice was annoyed it said what do you mean youve never been to alpha centauri for heavens sake mankind its only four light years aw ay you know im sorry but if you cant be bothered to take an interest in local affairs thats your own lookout energize the demolition beams light poured out into the hatchways i dont know said the voice on the pa apathetic bloody planet ive no sympathy at all it cut off there was a terrible ghastly silence there was a terrible ghastly noise there was a terrible ghastly silence the vogon constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void chapter far away on the opposite spiral arm of the galaxy five hundred thousand light years from the star sol zaphod beeblebrox president of the imperial galactic government sped across the seas of damogran his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the damogran sun damogran the hot damogran the remote damogran the almost totally unheard of damogran secret home of the heart of gold the boat sped on across the water it would be some time before it reached its destination because damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet it consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean the boat sped on because of this topological awkwardness damogran has always remained a deser ted planet this is why the imperial galactic government chose damogran for the heart of gold project because it was so deserted and the heart of gold was so secret the boat zipped and skipped across the sea the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet zaphod beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on easter island the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence ʹ in galacticspeke easter means small flat and light brown to the he art of gold island which by another meaningless coincidence was called france one of the side effects of work on the heart of gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences but it was not in any way a coincidence that today the day of culmination of the project the great day of unveiling the day that the heart of gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling galaxy was also a great day of culmination for zaphod beeblebrox it was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the presidency a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the imperial galaxy zaphod beeblebrox president not the zaphod beeblebrox not the president many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed zaphod beeblebrox adventurer ex ­‐hippy good timer crook quite possibly manic self ­‐publicist terribly bad at personal relationships often thought to be completely out to lunch president no one had gone bananas not in that way at least only six people in the entire galaxy understood the principle on which the galaxy was governed and they knew that once zaphod beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as presi dent it was more or less a fait accompli he was the ideal presidency fodder what they completely failed to understand was why zaphod was doing it he banked sharply shooting a wild wall of water at the sun today was the day today was the day when they would realize what zaphod had been up to today was what zaphod beeblebroxs presidency was all about today was also his two hundredth birthday but that was just another meaningless coincidence as he skipped his boat across the seas of damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be he relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the seat back he steered with an extra arm hed recently fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski ­‐boxing hey he cooed to himself youre a real cool boy you but his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle the island of france was about twenty miles long five miles across the middle sandy and crescent shaped in fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay this impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs from the top of the cliff th e land sloped slowly down five miles to the opposite shore on top of the cliffs stood a reception committee it consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the heart of gold ʹ mostly humanoid but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers two or three green slyph ­‐like maximegalacticans an octopoid physucturalist or two and a hooloovoo a hooloovoo is a super ­‐intelligent shade of the color blue all except the hooloovoo w ere resplendent in their multi ­‐colored ceremonial lab coats the hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion there was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws restructured the fundamental fabric of matter strained twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an ora nge sash round his neck an orange sash was what the president of the galaxy traditionally wore it might not even have made much difference to them if theyd known exactly how much power the president of the galaxy actually wielded none at all only si x people in the galaxy knew that the job of the galactic president was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it zaphod beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job the crowd gasped dazzled by sun and seemanship as the presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay it flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns in fact it didnt need to touch the water at all because i t was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms ʹ but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water they slashed sheets of water hissing into the air carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and sa nk back foaming into the boats wake as it careered across the bay zaphod loved effect it was what he was best at he twisted the wheel sharply the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion people the three billion people werent actually there but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri ­‐d camera which hovered obsequ iously in the air nearby the antics of the president always made amazingly popular tri ­‐d thats what they were for he grinned again three billion and six people didnt know it but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for the robo t camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two heads and he waved again he was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm his fair tousled hair stuck out in random directions his blue eyes glinted with someth ing completely unidentifiable and his chins were almost always unshaven a twenty ­‐foot­‐high transparent globe floated next to his boat rolling and bobbing glistening in the brilliant sun inside it floated a wide semi ­‐circular sofa upholstered in glori ous red leather the more the globe bobbed and rolled the more the sofa stayed perfectly still steady as an upholstered rock again all done for effect as much as anything zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa he spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee his heads looked about smiling he put his feet up at any moment he thought he might scream water boiled up beneath the bubble it seethed and spouted the bubble surged into the air bobbing and rolling on the water spout up up it climbed throwing stilts of light at the cliff up it surged on the jet the water falling from beneath it crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below zaphod smiled picturing himself a thoroughly ridiculous form of transport but a thoroughly beautiful one at the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment tipped on to a railed ramp rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt to tremendous appla use zaphod beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble his orange sash blazing in the light the president of the galaxy had arrived he waited for the applause to die down then raised his hands in greeting hi he said a government spider sidled up to h im and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the damogran sea some five miles out from the bay pages one and two had been salvaged by a damogran frond crested eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented it was constructed largely of paper and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it the damogra n frond crested eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it zaphod beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider hi he said again everyone be amed at him or at least nearly everyone he singled out trillian from the crowd trillian was a girl that zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet just for fun incognito she was slim darkish humanoid with long waves of black hair a full mouth an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes with her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely arabic not that anyone there had ever heard of an arab of course the ara bs had very recently ceased to exist and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years from damogran trillian wasnt anybody in particular or so zaphod claimed she just went around with him rather a lot and told him what she th ought of him hi honey he said to her she flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly ʹ but by this time he was looking at something else hi he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying hi and get on with the quotes he grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote the next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them one of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the president was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his poc ket away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle split and slowly folded itself down into the ground everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they had built it that way beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship one hundred and fifty metres long shaped like a sleek running shoe perfectly white and mindboggingly beautiful at the heart of it unseen lay a small gold box which carried within it the most bra in­‐wretching device ever conceived a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy a device after which the ship had been named ʹ the heart of gold wow said zaphod beeblebrox to the heart of gold there wasnt much else he coul d say he said it again because he knew it would annoy the press wow the crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly he winked at trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him she knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible showoff that is really amazing he said that really is truly amazing that is so amazingly amazing i think id like to steal it a marvellous presidential quote absolutely true to form the crowd laughed appreciatively the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their sub ­‐etha news ­‐matics and the president gr inned as he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small paralyso ­‐matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket finally he could bear it no more he lifted his heads up to the sky let out a wild whoop in major thirds threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles chapter prostetnic vogon jeltz was not a pleasant sight even for other vogons his highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead his dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of vogon civil service politics and play it well a nd waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects not that he ever went swimming of course his busy schedule would not allow it he was the way he was because billions of years ago when the v ogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of vogsphere and had lain panting and heaving on the planets virgin shores when the first rays of the bright young vogsol sun had shone across them that morning it was as if the forces of evol ution had simply given up on them there and then had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake they never evolved again they should never have survived the fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick ­‐willed slug­‐brained stubbornness of these creatures evolution they said to themselves who needs it and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with su rgery meanwhile the natural forces on the planet vogsphere had been working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder they brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs which the vogons ate smashing their shells with iron mallets tall asp iring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with elegant gazelle ­‐like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the vogons would catch and sit on they were no use as transport because thei r backs would snap instantly but the vogons sat on them anyway thus the planet vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel within a few short vog years every last vogon had migr ated to the megabrantis cluster the political hub of the galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the galactic civil service they have attempted to acquire learning they have attempted to acquire style and social grace but in most respe cts the modern vogon is little different from his primitive forebears every year they import twenty ­‐seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets prostetnic vogon jeltz was a fairly typical vogon in that he was thoroughly vile also he did not like hitchhikers somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of prostetnic vogon jeltzs flagship a small match flared nervously th e owner of the match was not a vogon but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous his name was ford prefect he looked about the cabin but could see very little strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame but all was quiet he breathed a silent thank you to the dentrassis the dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands a wild but pleasant bunch whom the vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets on the strict understan ding that they keep themselves very much to themselves this suited the dentrassis fine because they loved vogon money which is one of the hardest currencies in space but loathed the vogons themselves the only sort of vogon a dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed vogon it was because of this tiny piece of information that ford prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen ozone and carbon monoxide he heard a slight groan by the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor quick ly he shook the match out reached in his pocket found what he was looking for and took it out he crouched on the floor the shape moved again ford prefect said i bought some peanuts arthur dent moved and groaned again muttering incoherently here have some urged ford shaking the packet again if youve never been through a matter transference beam before youve probably lost some salt and protein the beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit whhhrrrr said arthur dent he opened his eyes its dark he said yes said ford prefect its dark no light said arthur dent dark no light one of the things ford prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious as in its a nice day or youre very tall or oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty ­‐foot wel l are you alright at first ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour if human beings dont keep exercising their lips he thought their mouths probably seize up after a few months consideration and observation he abandoned this t heory in favour of a new one if they dont keep on exercising their lips he thought their brains start working after a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all but he always r emained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didnt know about yes he agreed with arthur no light he helped arthur to some peanuts how do you feel he asked like a military academy said arthur bits of me keep on p assing out ford stared at him blankly in the darkness if i asked you where the hell we were said arthur weakly would i regret it ford stood up were safe he said oh good said arthur were in a small galley cabin said ford in on e of the spaceships of the vogon constructor fleet ah said arthur this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that i wasnt previously aware of ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch monstrous shadows leaped a nd loomed again arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing how did we get here he asked shivering slightly we hitched a lift said ford excuse me said arthur are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green bug ­‐eyed monster stuck his head out and s aid hi fellas hop right in i can take you as far as the basingstoke roundabout well said ford the thumbs an electronic sub ­‐etha signalling device the roundabouts at barnards star six light years away but otherwise thats more or less right and the bug ­‐eyed monster is green yes fine said arthur when can i get home you cant said ford prefect and found the light switch shade your eyes he said and turned it on even ford was surprised good grief said arthu r is this really the interior of a flying saucer prostetnic vogon jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge he always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets he wished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better he flopped as heavily as he could on to his control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry about but it only gave a complaining sort of creak go away he shouted at a young vogon guard who entered the bridge at that moment the guard vanished immediately feeling rather relieved he was glad it wouldnt now be him who delivered the report theyd just received the report was an official releas e which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base on damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes unnecessary another door slid open but this time the vogon captain didnt shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the dentrassis prepared his meals a meal would be most welcome a huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray it was grinning like a maniac prostetnic vog on jeltz was delighted he knew that when a dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about ford and arthur stared about them well what do you think said ford its a bit squalid isnt it ford frowned at the grubby mattress unwashed cups and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin well this is a working ship you see said ford these are the dentrassi sleeping quarters i thought you said they were called vogons or something yes said ford the vogons run the ship the dentrassis are the cooks they let us on board im confused said arthur here have a look at this said ford he sat down on one of the mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel arthur prodded the mattress nervously and then sat on it himself in fact he had very little to be nervous about because all mattresses grown in the swamps of squornshellous zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being put to service very few have ever come to life again ford handed the book to arthur what is it asked arthur the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy its a sort of electronic book it tells you everything you need to know about anything thats its job arthur turned it over nervously in his hands i like the cover he said dont panic its the first helpful or intelligible thing anybodys said to me all day ill show you how it works said ford he snatch ed it from arthur who was still holding it as if it was a two ­‐week ­‐dead lark and pulled it out of its cover you press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving you the index a screen about three inches by four lit up and characters b egan to flicker across the surface you want to know about vogons so i enter that name so his fingers tapped some more keys and there we are the words vogon constructor fleets flared in green across the screen ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it at the same time the book began to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice this is what the book said vogon constructor fleets here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a vogon forget it they are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy ʹ not actually evil but bad tempered bureaucratic officious and callous they wouldnt even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the ravenous bugblatter bea st of traal without orders signed in triplicate sent in sent back queried lost found subjected to public inquiry lost again and finally buried in soft peat and recycled as firelighters the best way to get a drink out of a vogon is to stick your finger down his throat and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal on no account allow a vogon to read poetry at you arthur blinked at it what a strange book how did we get a lift then thats the point its out of date now said ford sliding the book back into its cover im doing the field research for the new revised edition and one of the things ill have to include is a bit about how the vogons now employ dentrassi cooks whi ch gives us a rather useful little loophole a pained expression crossed arthurs face but who are the dentrassi he said great guys said ford theyre the best cooks and the best drink mixers and they dont give a wet slap about anything else and theyll always help hitchhikers aboard partly because they like the company but mostly because it annoys the vogons which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if youre an impoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the universe for less than thirty altairan dollars a day and thats my job fun isnt it arthur looked lost its amazing he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses unfortunately i got stuck on the earth for rather longer than i intended said ford i came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years but how did you get there in the first place then easy i got a lift with a teaser a teaser yeah er what is a teaser teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do they cruise around looking for planets which havent made interstellar contact yet and buzz them buzz them arthur began to feel that ford was enjoying making life difficult for him yeah said ford they buzz them they find some isolated spot with very few people around then land right by some poor soul whom no ones ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of hi m wearing silly antennae on their heads and making beep beep noises rather childish really ford leant back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with himself ford insisted arthur i dont know if this soun ds like a silly question but what am i doing here well you know that said ford i rescued you from the earth and whats happened to the earth ah its been demolished has it said arthur levelly yes it just boiled away into space look said arthur im a bit upset about that ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his mind yes i can understand that he said at last understand that shouted arthur understand that ford sprang up keep looking at the book he hissed urgently what dont panic im not panicking yes you are alright so im panicking what else is there to do you just come along with me and have a good time the galaxys a fun place youll need to have this fish in your ear i beg your pardon asked arthur rather politely he thought ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish wriggling around in it arthur blinked at him he wished there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of he would have felt safe if alongside the dentrassi underwear the piles of squornshellous mattresses and the man from b etelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of corn flakes he couldnt and he didnt feel safe suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he could identify he g asped in terror at what sounded like a man trying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves shush said ford listen it might be important im important its the vogon captain making an announcement on the tannoy you mean thats h ow the vogons talk listen but i cant speak vogon you dont need to just put that fish in your ear ford with a lightning movement clapped his hand to arthurs ear and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep into his aural tract gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so but then slowly turned goggle ­‐eyed with wonder he was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a pi cture of a white candlestick or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of glasses he was still liste ning to the howling gargles he knew that only now it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward english this is what he heard chapter howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a good time message repeats this is your captain speaking so stop whatever youre doing and pay attention first of all i see from our instruments that we have a couple of hitchhikers aboard hello wh erever you are i just want to make it totally clear that you are not at all welcome i worked hard to get where i am today and i didnt become captain of a vogon constructor ship simply so i could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders i have sent out a search party and as soon that they find you i will put you off the ship if youre very lucky i might read you some of my poetry first secondly we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to barnards star on arri val we will stay in dock for a seventy ­‐two hour refit and no ones to leave the ship during that time i repeat all planet leave is cancelled ive just had an unhappy love affair so i dont see why anybody else should have a good time message ends the noise stopped arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head he smiled weakly charming man he said i wish i had a daughter so i could forbid her to marry on e you wouldnt need to said ford theyve got as much sex appeal as a road accident no dont move he added as arthur began to uncurl himself youd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace its unpleasantly like being drunk whats so unpleasant about being drunk you ask a glass of water arthur thought about this ford he said yeah whats this fish doing in my ear its translating for you its a babel fish look it up in the book if you like he tossed over the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and then curled himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the jump at that moment the bottom fell out of arthurs mind his eyes turned inside out his feet began to leak out of the top of his head the room folded flat about him spun around shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own navel they were passing through hyperspace the babel fish said the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy quietly is small yellow and leec h­‐like and probably the oddest thing in the universe it feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but from those around it it absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with it then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them the practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a babel fish in you r ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language the speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your babel fish now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence th at anything so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non­‐existence of god the argument goes something like this i refuse to prove that i exist says god for proof denies faith and without faith i am nothing but says man the babel fish is a dead giveaway isnt it it could not have evolved by chance it proves you exist and so therefore by your own arguments you dont qed oh dear says god i hadnt thought of that and promptly vanished in a puff of logic oh that was easy says man and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing most leading theologians clai m that this argument is a load of dingos kidneys but that didnt stop oolon colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best ­‐selling book well that about wraps it up for god meanwhile the poor babel fish by effectiv ely removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures has caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the history of creation arthur let out a low groan he was horrified to discover that the kick through hyperspace ha dnt killed him he was now six light years from the place that the earth would have been if it still existed the earth visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind there was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole earth having gone it was too big he prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone no reaction he thought of all the people he had been close to no reaction then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in t he queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden stab ʹ the supermarket was gone everything in it was gone nelsons column had gone nelsons column had gone and there would be no outcry because there was no one left to make an outcry from now on n elsons column only existed in his mind england only existed in his mind ʹ his mind stuck here in this dank smelly steel ­‐lined spaceship a wave of claustrophobia closed in on him england no longer existed hed got that ʹ somehow hed got it he tried again america he thought has gone he couldnt grasp it he decided to start smaller again new york has gone no reaction hed never seriously believed it existed anyway the dollar he thought had sunk for ever slight tremor there every bogart mo vie has been wiped he said to himself and that gave him a nasty knock mcdonalds he thought there is no longer any such thing as a mcdonalds hamburger he passed out when he came round a second later he found he was sobbing for his mother he jerke d himself violently to his feet ford ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to himself he always found the actual travelling ­‐through ­‐space part of space travel rather trying yeah he said if youre a researcher on this b ook thing and you were on earth you must have been gathering material on it well i was able to extend the original entry a bit yes let me see what it says in this edition then ive got to see it yeah ok he passed it over again arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking he pressed the entry for the relevant page the screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print arthur stared at it it doesnt have an entry he burst out ford looked over h is shoulder yes it does he said down there see at the bottom of the screen just under eccentrica gallumbits the triple ­‐breasted whore of eroticon arthur followed fords finger and saw where it was pointing for a moment it still didnt regi ster then his mind nearly blew up what harmless is that all its got to say harmless one word ford shrugged well there are a hundred billion stars in the galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the books microprocessors he said an d no one knew much about the earth of course well for gods sake i hope you managed to rectify that a bit oh yes well i managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor he had to trim it a bit but its still an improvement and what does it say now asked arthur mostly harmless admitted ford with a slightly embarrassed cough mostly harmless shouted arthur what was that noise hissed ford it was me shouting shouted arthur no shut up said ford i think were in trouble you think were in trouble outside the door were the sounds of marching feet the dentrassi whispered arthur no those are steel tipped boots said ford there was a sharp ringing rap on th e door then who is it said arthur well said ford if were lucky its just the vogons come to throw us in to space and if were unlucky if were unlucky said ford grimly the captain might be serious in his threat that hes going to r ead us some of his poetry first chapter vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the universe the second worst is that of the azagoths of kria during a recitation by their poet master grunthos the flatulent of his poem ode to a small lump of green putty i found in my armpit one midsummer morning four of his audience died of internal haemorrhagin g and the president of the mid ­‐galactic arts nobbling council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off grunthos is reported to have been disappointed by the poems reception and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve ­‐book epic entitled my f avourite bathtime gurgles when his own major intestine in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain the very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator paula nancy millstone je nnings of greenbridge essex england in the destruction of the planet earth prostetnic vogon jeltz smiled very slowly this was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements he had had a terribly the rapeutic yell at his prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little callousness the prisoners sat in poetry appreciation chairs ʹ strapped in vogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were generally held in their ear ly attempts at composition had been part of bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved and cultured race but now the only thing that kept them going was sheer bloodymindedness the sweat stood out cold on ford prefects brow and slid round the electrodes strapped to his temples these were attached to a battery of electronic equipment ʹ imagery intensifiers rhythmic modulators alliterative residulators and simile dumpers ʹ all designed to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure that not a single nuance of the poets thought was lost arthur dent sat and quivered he had no idea what he was in for but he knew that he hadnt liked anything that had happened so far and didnt think things were likely to change the vogo n began to read ʹ a fetid little passage of his own devising oh frettled gruntbuggly he began spasms wracked fords body ʹ this was worse than ever hed been prepared for thy micturations are to me as plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh went ford prefect wrenching his head back as lumps of pain thumped through it he could dimly see beside him arthur lolling and rolling in his seat he clenched his teeth groop i implore thee continued the merciless vogo n my foonting turlingdromes his voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency and hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles or i will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon see if i dont nnnnnnnnnnyyyyy yyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh cried ford prefect and threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of the last line caught him full blast across the temples he went limp arthur lolled now earthlings whirred the vogon he didnt know that f ord prefect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of betelgeuse and wouldnt have cared if he had i present you with a simple choice either die in the vacuum of space or he paused for melodramatic effect tell me how good you thought my poem was he threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat ­‐shaped seat and watched them he did the smile again ford was rasping for breath he rolled his dusty tongue round his parched mouth and moaned arthur said brightly actually i quite liked it ford turned and gaped here was an approach that had quite simply not occurred to him the vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his nose and was therefore no bad thing oh good he whirred in considerable astonishment oh yes said arthur i thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly effective ford continued to stare at him slowly organizing his thoughts around this totally new conc ept were they really going to be able to bareface their way out of this yes do continue invited the vogon oh and er interesting rhythmic devices too continued arthur which seemed to counterpoint the er er he floundered ford leaped to his rescue hazarding counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the er he floundered too but arthur was ready again humanity of the vogonity ford hissed at him ah yes vogonity sorry of the poets co mpassionate soul arthur felt he was on a home stretch now which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this transcend that and come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other he was reaching a triumphant cresc endo and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into into er which suddenly gave out on him ford leaped in with the coup de grace into whatever it was the poem was about he yelled out of the corner of his mouth well don e arthur that was very good the vogon perused them for a moment his embittered racial soul had been touched but he thought no ʹ too little too late his voice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon so what youre saying is that i wri te poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior i really just want to be loved he said he paused is that right ford laughed a nervous laugh well i mean yes he said dont we all deep down you know er the vogon stood u p no well youre completely wrong he said i just write poetry to throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief im going to throw you off the ship anyway guard take the prisoners to number three airlock and throw them out what shouted ford a huge young vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery arms you cant throw us into space yelled ford were trying to write a book resistance is useless shouted the vogon guard back at him it was the first phrase hed learnt when he joined the vogon guard corps the captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away arthur stared round him wildly i dont want to die now he yelled ive still got a headache i dont want to go to heaven with a headache id be all cross and wouldnt enjoy it the guard grasped them both firmly round the neck and bowing deferentially towards his captains back hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge a steel door closed and the captain was on his own again he hummed quietly and mused to himself lightly fingering his notebook of verses hmmmm he said counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor he considered this for a moment and then closed the book wit h a grim smile deaths too good for them he said the long steel ­‐lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery vogon armpits this is great spluttered arthur this is really terrific let go of me you brute the vogon guard dragged them on dont you worry said ford ill think of something he didnt sound hopeful resistance is useless bellowed the guard just dont say things like that stammered ford how can anyone maintain a positive mental attitude if youre saying things like that my god complained arthur youre talking about a positive mental attitude and you havent even had your planet demoli shed today i woke up this morning and thought id have a nice relaxed day do a bit of reading brush the dog its now just after four in the afternoon and im already thrown out of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the ear th he spluttered and gurgled as the vogon tightened his grip alright said ford just stop panicking who said anything about panicking snapped arthur this is still just the culture shock you wait till ive settled down into the situation and found my bearings then ill start panicking arthur youre getting hysterical shut up ford tried desperately to think but was interrupted by the guard shouting again resistance is useless and you can shut up as well snapped ford resis tance is useless oh give it a rest said ford he twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captors face a thought struck him do you really enjoy this sort of thing he asked suddenly the vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over his face enjoy he boomed what do you mean what i mean said ford is does it give you a full satisfying life stomping around shouting pushing people out of spaceships the vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled over each other his mouth slacked finally he said well the hours are good theyd have to be agreed ford arthur twisted his head to look at ford ford what ar e you doing he asked in an amazed whisper oh just trying to take an interest in the world around me ok he said so the hours are pretty good then he resumed the vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths yeah he said but now you come to mention it most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy except he thought again which required looking at the ceiling ʹ except some of the shouting i quite like he filled his lungs and bellowed resistance i s sure yes interrupted ford hurriedly youre good at that i can tell but if its mostly lousy he said slowly giving the words time to reach their mark then why do you do it what is it the girls the leather the machismo or do you just find that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge er said the guard er er i dunno i think i just sort of do it really my aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a young vogon ʹ you know the uniform the low ­‐slung stun ray holster the mindless tedium there you are arthur said ford with the air of someone reaching the conclusion of his argument you think youve got problems arthur rather thought he had apart from t he unpleasant business with his home planet the vogon guard had half ­‐throttled him already and he didnt like the sound of being thrown into space very much try and understand his problem insisted ford here he is poor lad his entire lifes work is stamping around throwing people off spaceships and shouting added the guard and shouting sure said ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round his neck in friendly condescension and he doesnt even know why hes doing it arthur agreed this was very sad he did this with a small feeble gesture because he was too asphyxicated to speak deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard well now you put it like that i suppose good lad encouraged ford but alrigh t went on the rumblings so whats the alternative well said ford brightly but slowly stop doing it of course tell them he went on youre not going to do it anymore he felt he had to add something to that but for the moment the guard se emed to have his mind occupied pondering that much eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm said the guard erm well that doesnt sound that great to me ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away now wait a minute he said thats just the start you see theres more to it than that you see but at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock he was obviously quite touched no i think if its all the same to you he said id better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting ive got to do it wasnt all the same to ford prefect after all come on now but look he said less slowly less brightly huhhhhgggggggnnn nnnn said arthur without any clear inflection but hang on pursued ford theres music and art and things to tell you about yet arrrggghhh resistance is useless bellowed the guard and then added you see if i keep it up i can eventually g et promoted to senior shouting officer and there arent usually many vacancies for non ­‐shouting and non­‐pushing ­‐people ­‐about officers so i think id better stick to what i know they had now reached the airlock ʹ a large circular steel hatchway of mass ive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft the guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open but thanks for taking an interest said the vogon guard bye now he flung ford and arthur through the hatchway into the s mall chamber within arthur lay panting for breath ford scrambled round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway but listen he shouted to the guard theres a whole world you dont know anything about here how about this desperately he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand ʹ he hummed the first bar of beethovens fifth da da da dum doesnt that stir anything in you no said the guard not really but ill mention it to my aunt if he said anything further after that it was lost the hatchway sealed itself tight and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of the ships engines they were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diameter and ten feet long potentially bri ght lad i thought he said and slumped against the curved wall arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen he didnt look up he just lay panting were trapped now arent we yes said ford were trapped well didnt you think of anything i thought you said you were going to think of something perhaps you thought of something and didnt notice oh yes i thought of something panted ford arthur looked up expectantly but unfortunately continued ford it rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway he kicked the hatch theyd just been through but it was a good idea was it oh yes very neat what was it well i hadnt worked out the details yet not much point n ow is there so er what happens next oh er well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space i expect and asphyxicate if you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty seconds of course said ford he stuck his hands behind his back raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old betelgeusian battle hymn to arthurs eyes he suddenly looked very alien so this is it said arthur were going to die yes said ford except no wait a minute he suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind arthurs line of vision whats this switch he cried what where cried arthur twisting round no i was only fooling said ford we are going to die after all he slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he left off you know said arthur its at times like this when im trapped in a vogon airlock with a man from betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxication in dee p space that i really wish id listened to what my mother told me when i was young why what did she tell you i dont know i didnt listen oh ford carried on humming this is terrific arthur thought to himself nelsons column has gone mcdonalds have gone all thats left is me and the words mostly harmless any second now all that will be left is mostly harmless and yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well a motor whirred a slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushi ng air as the outer hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny impossibly bright points of light ford and arthur popped into outer space like corks from a toy gun chapter the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a wholly remarkable book it has been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many different editorships it contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and researchers the intr oduction begins like this space it says is big really big you just wont believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is i mean you may think its a long way down the road to the chemist but thats just peanuts to space listen and so on after a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year tha t any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you leave so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally important to get a receipt to be fair though wh en confronted by the sheer enormity of distances between the stars better minds than the one responsible for the guides introduction have faltered some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a small walnut in johannesburg and other such dizzying concepts the simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination even light which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all takes time to journey betwe en the stars it takes eight minutes from the star sol to the place where the earth used to be and four years more to arrive at sols nearest stellar neighbour alpha proxima for light to reach the other side of the galaxy for it to reach damogran for instance takes rather longer five hundred thousand years the record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five years but you dont get to see much on the way the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds however it goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundre d and sixty ­‐seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against by a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an islington flat where arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with ʹ she went off with a gatecrasher though the planet earth the islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished it is comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty ­‐nine seconds later ford and arthur were rescued chapter a computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason this was because reason was in fact out to lunch a hole had just appeared in the galaxy it was exactly a nothingth of a second long a nothi ngth of an inch wide and quite a lot of million light years from end to end as it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe a team of seven three ­‐foot­‐high market analysts fell out of it and die d partly of asphyxication partly of surprise two hundred and thirty ­‐nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too materializing in a large woobly heap on the famine ʹ struck land of poghril in the pansel system the whole poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later the nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns these patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves this was part of what w as so extraordinary of the patterns and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to that was how life began in the universe five wild event maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed up a pavement on the pavem ent lay ford prefect and arthur dent gulping like half­‐spent fish there you are gasped ford scrabbling for a fingerhold on the pavement as it raced through the third reach of the unknown i told you id think of something oh sure said arthur sure bright idea of mine said ford to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it the real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them various pretend ones flitted silently by like mountain goats primal light exploded splattering space ­‐time as with gobbets of junket time blossomed matter shrank away the highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever oh come off it said arthur the chances against it were astronomical dont knock it it worked said ford what sort of ship are we in asked arthur as the pit of eternity yawned beneath them i dont know said ford i havent opened my eyes yet no nor have i said arthur the universe jumped froze quivere d and splayed out in several unexpected directions arthur and ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise good god said arthur it looks just like the sea front at southend hell im relieved to hear you say that said for d why because i thought i must be going mad perhaps you are perhaps you only thought i said it ford thought about this well did you say it or didnt you he asked i think so said arthur well perhaps were both going mad yes said arthur wed be mad all things considered to think this was southend well do you think this is southend oh yes so do i therefore we must be mad nice day for it yes said a passing maniac who was that asked arthur who ʹ the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers yes i dont know just someone ah they both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the uncertain areas you know said arthur with a s light cough if this is southend theres something very odd about it you mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep washing up and down said ford yes i thought that was odd too in fact he continued as with a huge bang southend split itself into six equal segments which danced and span giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formation there is something altogether very strange going on wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind hot doughnuts po pped out of the road for ten pence each horrid fish stormed out of the sky and arthur and ford decided to make a run for it they plunged through heavy walls of sound mountains of archaic thought valleys of mood music bad shoe sessions and footling ba ts and suddenly heard a girls voice it sounded quite a sensible voice but it just said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling and that was all ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a source f or the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe in what was that voice shouted arthur i dont know yelled ford i dont know it sounded like a measurement of probability probability what do you mean probability you know like two to one three to one five to four against it said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against thats pretty improbable you know a million ­‐gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning but what does it mean cried arthur what the custard no the measurement of probability i dont know i dont know at all i think were on some kind of spaceship i can only assume said arthur that this is not the first ­‐class compartment bulges appeared in the fabric of space ­‐time great ugly bulges haaaauuurrgghhh said arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions southend seems to be melting away the stars are swirling a dustbowl my legs are drifting off into the sunset my left arms come off too a frightening thought struck him hell he said how am i going to operate my digital watch now he wound his eyes desperately around in fords direction ford he said youre turning into a penguin stop it again came the voice two to the power of seventy ­‐five thousand to one against and falling ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle hey who are you he quacked where are you whats going on and is there any way of stopping it please relax said the voice pleasantly like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire you are perfectly safe but thats not the point raged ford the point is that i am now a perfectly save penguin a nd my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs its alright ive got them back now said arthur two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling said the voice admittedly said arthur theyre longer than i usually like them but isnt there anything squawked ford in avian fury you feel you ought to be telling us the voice cleared its throat a giant petit four lolloped off into the distance welcome the voice said to the starship heart of gold the voice continued please do not be alarmed it said by anything you see or hear around you you are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have been rescued from certain death at an i mprobability level of two to the power of two hundred and seventy ­‐six thousand to one against ʹ possibly much higher we are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty ­‐five thousand to one against and falling and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway thank you two to the power of twenty thousan d to one against and falling the voice cut out ford and arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle ford was wildly excited arthur he said this is fantastic weve been picked up by a ship powered by the infinite improbability drive this is incredible i heard rumors about it before they were all officially denied but they must have done it theyve built the improbability drive arthur this is arthur whats happening arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle tryin g to hold it closed but it was ill fitting tiny furry little hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks their fingers were inkstained tiny voices chattered insanely arthur looked up ford he said theres an infinite number of monkeys ou tside who want to talk to us about this script for hamlet theyve worked out chapter the infinite improbability drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second without all that tedious muck ing about in hyperspace it was discovered by a lucky chance and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the galactic governments research team on damogran this briefly is the story of its discovery the principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a bambleweeny sub ­‐meson brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong brownian motion producer say a nice hot cup of tea were of course well understood ʹ and such gener ators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostesss undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy many respectable physicists said that they werent going to stand for this ʹ partly because it was a debasement of science but mostly because they didnt get invited to those sort of parties another thing they couldnt stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which co uld generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mind ­‐paralysing distances between the furthest stars and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible then one day a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way if he thought to himself such a machine is a virtual impossibility then it must logically be a finite improbability so all i have to do in order t o make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is feed that figure into the finite improbability generator give it a fresh cup of really hot tea and turn it on he did this and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after golden infinite improbability generator out of thin air it startled him even more when just after he was awarded the galactic institutes prize for extre me cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldnt stand was a smartass chapter the improbability ­‐proof control cabin of the heart of gold looked like a perf ectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new some of the control seats hadnt had the plastic wrapping taken off yet the cabin was mostly white oblong and about the size of a smallish restaurant in fact it wasn t perfectly oblong the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve and all the angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes the truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to bu ild the cabin as an ordinary three ­‐ dimensional oblong rom but then the designers would have got miserable as it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on the concave wall a nd long banks of computers set into the convex wall in one corner a robot sat humped its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees it too was fairly new but though it was beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid body didnt quite fit properly in fact they fitted perfectly well but something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better zaphod beeblebrox paced nervously up and d own the cabin brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off figures her voice was carried round the tannoy system of the whole ship five to one against and falling she said four to one against and falling three to one two one probability factor of one to one we have normality i repeat we have normality she turned her microphone off ʹ then turned it back on with a slight smile and continued anything you still cant cope with is therefore your own problem please relax you will be sent for soon zaphod burst out in annoyance who are they trillian trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space she said section zz plural z alpha yeah well thats a very sweet thought trillian complained zaphod but do you really think its wise under the circumstances i mean here we are on the run and everyth ing we must have the police of half the galaxy after us by now and we stop to pick up hitchhikers ok so ten out of ten for style but minus several million for good thinking yeah he tapped irritably at a control panel trillian quietly moved his hand before he tapped anything important whatever zaphods qualities of mind might include ʹ dash bravado conceit ʹ he was mechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture trillian had come to suspect that the main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he never really understood the significance of anything he did zaphod she said patiently they were floating unprotected in open space you wouldnt want them to have died would you well you know no not as such but not as such not die as such but trillian cocked her head on one side well maybe someone else might have picked them up later a second later and they would have been dead yeah so if youd taken the trouble to think about the problem a bit longer it would have gone away youd been happy to let them die well you know not happy as such but anyway said trillian turning back to the controls i didnt pick them up what do you m ean who picked them up then the ship did huh the ship did all by itself huh whilst we were in improbability drive but thats incredible no zaphod just very very improbable er yeah look zaphod she said patting his arm dont worry about the aliens theyre just a couple of guys i expect ill send the robot down to get them and bring them up here hey marvin in the corner the robots head swung up sharply but then wobbled a bout imperceptibly it pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room it stopped in front of trillian and seemed to stare through her left shoulder i think you ought to know im feeling very depressed it said its voice was low and hopeless oh god muttered zaphod and slumped into a seat well said trillian in a bright compassionate tone heres something to oc cupy you and keep your mind off things it wont work droned marvin i have an exceptionally large mind marvin warned trillian alright said marvin what do you want me to do go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here under surveillance with a microsecond pause and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre ʹ nothing you could actually take offence at ʹ marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human just that he sai d yes said trillian firmly i wont enjoy it said marvin zaphod leaped out of his seat shes not asking you to enjoy it he shouted just do it will you alright said marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell ill do it goo d snapped zaphod great thank you marvin turned and lifted his flat ­‐topped triangular red eyes up towards him im not getting you down at all am i he said pathetically no no marvin lilted trillian thats just fine really i wouldnt like to think that i was getting you down no dont worry about that the lilt continued you just act as comes naturally and everything will be just fine youre sure you dont mind probed marvin no no marvin lilted trillian thats just fine really just part of life marvin flashed him an electronic look life said marvin dont talk to me about life he turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the cabin with a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind him i dont think i can stand that robot much longer zaphod growled trillian the encyclopaedia galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man the marketing division of the sirius cybernetics corporation defines a robot as your plastic pal whos fun to be with the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy defines the marketing division of the s irius cybernetics corporation as a bunch of mindless jerks wholl be the first against the wall when the revolution comes with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotic s correspondent curiously enough an edition of the encyclopaedia galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing division of the sirius cybernetics corporation as a bunch of mind less jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came the pink cubicle had winked out of existence the monkeys had sunk away to a better dimension ford and arthur found themselves in the embarkation area of the ship it was rather s mart i think the ships brand new said ford how can you tell asked arthur have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal no i just found this sales brochure lying on the floor its a lot of the universe can be yours stuf f ah look i was right ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to arthur it says sensational new breakthrough in improbability physics as soon as the ships drive reaches infinite improbability it passes through every point in the universe be the envy of other major governments wow this is big league stuff ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read ʹ clearly galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his exile arthur listened for a short while but being unable to understand the vast majority of what ford was saying he began to let his mind wander trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank he reached out and p ressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel the panel lit up with the words please do not press this button again he shook himself listen said ford who was still engrossed in the sales brochure they make a big thing of the ships cybe rnetics a new generation of sirius cybernetics corporation robots and computers with the new gpp feature gpp feature said arthur whats that oh it says genuine people personalities oh said arthur sounds ghastly a voice behind th em said it is the voice was low and hopeless and accompanied by a slight clanking sound they span round and saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway what they said ghastly continued marvin it all is absolutely ghastly just dont even talk about it look at this door he said stepping through it the irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure all the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition it is their pleasure to open for you and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done as the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied sigh ­‐like quality to it hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah it said marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it further circuits cut in saying why bother whats the point nothing is worth getting involved i n further circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components of the door and of the humanoids brain cells for a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again i n boredom a spasm of despair shook the robots body as he turned come on he droned ive been ordered to take you down to the bridge here i am brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge call that job satisfaction cos i dont he turned and walked back to the hated door er excuse me said ford following after him which government owns this ship marvin ignored him you watch this door he muttered its about to open again i can tell by the intolerab le air of smugness it suddenly generates with an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and marvin stomped through come on he said the others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with pleased little clicks and whirrs thank you the marketing division of the sirius cybernetics corporation said marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming curved corridor that stretched out before them lets build robots with genuine people personalities they said so they tried it out with me im a personality prototype you can tell cant you ford and arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers i hate that door continued marvin im not getting you down at all am i which government started ford again no gove rnment owns it snapped the robot its been stolen stolen stolen mimicked marvin who by asked ford zaphod beeblebrox something extraordinary happened to fords face at least five entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement piled up on it in a jumbled mess his left leg which was in mid stride seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again he stared at the robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles zaphod beeblebrox he said weakly sorry did i say something wrong said marvin dragging himself on regardless pardon me for breathing which i never do anyway so i dont know why i bother to say it oh god im so depressed heres another of those self ­‐satisfied door life dont talk to m e about life no one ever mentioned it muttered arthur irritably ford are you alright ford stared at him did that robot say zaphod beeblebrox he said chapter a loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the heart of gold cabin as zaphod searched the sub ­‐etha radio wavebands for news of himself the machine was rather difficult to operate for years radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turni ng dials then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were made touch ­‐sensitive ­‐you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope it saved a lot of muscular expenditure of course but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again more gunk music but this time it was a background to a ne ws announcement the news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music and news brought to you here on the sub ­‐etha wave band broadcasting around the galaxy around the clock squawked a voice and well be saying a big hello to all i ntelligent life forms everywhere and to everyone else out there the secret is to bang the rocks together guys and of course the big news story tonight is the sensational theft of the new improbability drive prototype ship by none other than galactic president zaphod beeblebrox and the question everyones asking is has the big z finally flipped beeblebrox the man who invented the pan galactic gargle blaster ex­‐confidence trickster once described by eccentrica gallumbits as the best bang since the big one and recently voted the worst dressed sentinent being in the known universe for the seventh time has he got an answer this time we asked his private brain care specialist gag halfrunt the music swirled and dived for a moment another v oice broke in presumably halfrunt he said well zaphods jist zis guy you know but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radios onoff sensitive airspace zaphod turned and glared at trillian ʹ she had throw n the pencil hey he said what do you do that for trillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures ive just thought of something she said yeah worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for you hear enough about yourself as it is im very insecure we know that can we drop your ego for a moment this is important if theres anything more important than my ego around i want it caught and shot now zaphod glared at her again then laughed listen she said w e picked up those couple of guys what couple of guys the couple of guys we picked up oh yeah said zaphod those couple of guys we picked them up in sector zz plural z alpha yeah said zaphod and blinked trillian said quietly does that mean anything to you mmmmm said zaphod zz plural z alpha zz plural z alpha well said trillian er what does the z mean said zaphod which one any one one of the major difficulties trillian experienced in her rela tionship with zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard pretending to be stupid because he couldnt be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him pretending to be outrageousl y stupid to hide the fact that he actually didnt understand what was going on and really being genuinely stupid he was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so ʹ but not all the time which obviously worried him hence the act he pr offered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous this above all appeared to trillian to be genuinely stupid but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it she sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she could make it simple for him whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way there she pointed right there hey yeah said zaphod well she said well what parts of th e inside of her head screamed at other parts of the inside of her head she said very calmly its the same sector you originally picked me up in he looked at her and then looked back at the screen hey yeah he said now that is wild we should have zapped straight into the middle of the horsehead nebula how did we come to be there i mean thats nowhere she ignored this improbability drive she said patiently you explained it to me yourself we pass through every point in the universe you know that yeah but thats one wild coincidence isnt it yes picking someone up at that point out of the whole of the universe to choose from thats just too i want to work this out computer the sirius cybernetics corporation shipboard computer which controlled and permeated every particle of the ship switched into communication mode hi there it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of ticker tape just for the record the ticker tape said hi there oh god said zaphod he hadnt worked with this computer for long but had already learned to loathe it the computer continued brash and cheery as if it was selling detergent i want you to know that whate ver your problem i am here to help you solve it yeah yeah said zaphod look i think ill just use a piece of paper sure thing said the computer spilling out its message into a waste bin at the same time i understand if you ever want shut up said zaphod and snatching up a pencil sat down next to trillian at the console ok ok said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed down its speech channel again zaphod and trillian pored over the figures that the improbability flight path scanner flashed silently up in front of them can we work out said zaphod from their point of view what the improbability of their rescue was yes thats a constant said trillian two to the power of two hundred and seventy ­‐six th ousand seven hundred and nine to one against thats high theyre two lucky lucky guys yes but relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up trillian punched up the figures they showed t wo­‐to­‐the power ­‐of­‐ infinity ­‐minus ­‐one an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in improbability physics its pretty low continued zaphod with a slight whistle yes agreed trillian and looked at him quizzically thats one big whack of improbability to be accounted for something pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance sheet if its all going to add up into a pretty sum zaphod scribbled a few sums crossed them out and threw the pencil away bat s dots i cant work it out well zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth ok he said computer the voice circuits sprang to life again why hello there they said ticker tape ticker tape all i want t o do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer yeah well shut up and work something out for me sure thing chattered the computer you want a probability forecast based on improbability data yeah ok the computer continued heres an interesting little notion did you realize that most peoples lives are governed by telephone numbers a pained look crawled across one of zaphods faces and on to the other one have you flipped he said no but you will when i tell you that trillian gasped she scrabbled at the buttons on the improbability flight path screen telephone number she said did that thing say telephone number numbers flashed up on the screen the computer had paused politely but now it continued what i was about to say was that dont bother please said trillian look what is this said zaphod i dont know said trillian but those aliens ʹ theyre on the way up to the bridge with that wretched robot can we pick them up on any mo nitor cameras chapter marvin trudged on down the corridor still moaning and then of course ive got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side no said arthur grimly as he walked along beside him really oh yes said marvin i mean ive asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens i can imagine vague whistling and humming noises were coming from ford well well well he kept saying to himself zaphod beeblebrox suddenly marvin st opped and held up a hand you know whats happened now of course no what said arthur who didnt what to know weve arrived at another of those doors there was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor marvin eyed it suspiciously well said ford impatiently do we go through do we go through mimicked marvin yes this is the entrance to the bridge i was told to take you to the bridge probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today i sho uldnt wonder slowly with great loathing he stepped towards the door like a hunter stalking his prey suddenly it slid open thank you it said for making a simple door very happy deep in marvins thorax gears ground funny he intoned fun erally how just when you think life cant possibly get any worse it suddenly does he heaved himself through the door and left ford and arthur staring at each other and shrugging their shoulders from inside they heard marvins voice again i suppose you want to see the aliens now he said do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where im standing yeah just show them in would you marvin came another voice arthur looked at ford and was astonished to see him laughing whats shhh said ford come in he stepped through into the bridge arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console picking the teeth in his right ­‐hand head with his left hand the right ­‐hand head seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this task but the left ­‐hand one was grinning a broad relaxed nonchalant grin the number of things that arthur couldnt believe he was seeing was fairly large his jaw flapped about at a loose end for a while the peculiar man waved a lazy wave at ford and with an appalling affectation of nonchalance said ford hi how are you glad you could drop in ford was not going to be outcooled zaphod he drawled great to see you youre looking well the extra arm suits you nice ship youve stolen arthur goggled at him you mean you know this guy he said waving a wild finger at zaphod know him exclaimed ford hes he paused and decided to do the introductions the other way round oh zaphod this is a friend of mine arthur dent he said i saved him when his planet blew up oh sure said zaphod hi arthur glad you could make it his right ­‐hand head looked round casually said hi and went back to having his teeth picked ford carried on and arthur he said this is m y semi ­‐cousin zaphod beeb weve met said arthur sharply when youre cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from fourt h to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess it tends to throw you off your stride in much the same way that this remark threw ford prefect off his err what i said weve met zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply hey er have we hey er ford rounded on arthur with an angry flash in his eyes now he felt he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself with this ignorant p rimitive who knew as much about the affairs of the galaxy as an ilford ­‐based gnat knew about life in peking what do you mean youve met he demanded this is zaphod beeblebrox from betelgeuse five you know not bloody martin smith from croydon i dont care said arthur coldly weve met havent we zaphod beeblebrox ʹ or should i say phil what shouted ford youll have to remind me said zaphod ive a terrible memory for species it was at a party pursued arthur yeah well i doubt that said zaphod cool it will you arthur demanded ford arthur would not be deterred a party six months ago on earth england zaphod shook his head with a tight ­‐lipped smile london insisted arthur islington oh said zaph od with a guilty start that party this wasnt fair on ford at all he looked backwards and forwards between arthur and zaphod what he said to zaphod you dont mean to say youve been on that miserable planet as well do you no of course not said zaphod breezily well i may have just dropped in briefly you know on my way somewhere but i was stuck there for fifteen years well i didnt know that did i but what were you doing there looking about you kno w he gatecrashed a party persisted arthur trembling with anger a fancy dress party it would have to be wouldnt it said ford at this party persisted arthur was a girl oh well look it doesnt matter now the whole place has gone up in smoke anyway i wish youd stop sulking about that bloody planet said ford who was the lady oh just somebody well alright i wasnt doing very well with her id been trying all evening hell she was something though beautiful charm ing devastatingly intelligent at last id got her to myself for a bit and was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours barges up and says hey doll is this guy boring you why dont you talk to me instead im from a different planet i n ever saw her again zaphod exclaimed ford yes said arthur glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish he only had the two arms and the one head and he called himself phil but but you must admit he did turn out to be from another plane t said trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge she gave arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the ships controls again there was silence for a few seconds and then out of the scrambled mess of arthurs brain crawled some words tricia mcmillian he said what are you doing here same as you she said i hitched a lift after all with a degree in maths and another in astrophysics what else was there to do it wa s either that or the dole queue again on monday infinity minus one chattered the computer improbability sum now complete zaphod looked about him at ford at arthur and then at trillian trillian he said is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the improbability drive very probably im afraid she said chapter the heart of gold fled on silently through the night of space now on conventional photon drive its crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence but by some curious principle of physics ʹ as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that go verned the relationships between atoms and molecules as the ships artificial night closed in they were each grateful to retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts trillian couldnt sleep she sat on a couch and stared at a small c age which contained her last and only links with earth ʹ two white mice that she had insisted zaphod let her bring she had expected not to see the planet again but she was disturbed by her negative reaction to the planets destruction it seemed remote a nd unreal and she could find no thoughts to think about it she watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention suddenly she shook herself and went back to the brid ge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures that charted the ships progress through the void she wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think about zaphod couldnt sleep he also wished he knew what it was that he wouldnt let hims elf think about for as long as he could remember hed suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there most of the time he was able to put this thought aside and not worry about it but it had been re ­‐awakened by the sudden inexplicable arriv al of ford prefect and arthur dent somehow it seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldnt see ford couldnt sleep he was too excited about being back on the road again fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over just as he was finally beginni ng to give up hope knocking about with zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun though there seemed to be something faintly odd about his semi ­‐cousin that he couldnt put his finger on the fact that he had become president of the galaxy was frankly astonishing as was the manner of his leaving the post was there a reason behind it there would be no point in asking zaphod he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all he had turned unfathomably into an art form he attacked everythi ng in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which arthur slept he was terribly tired there was a tap at zaphods door it slid open zaphod yeah i think we just fo und what you came to look for hey yeah ford gave up the attempt to sleep in the corner of his cabin was a small computer screen and keyboard he sat at it for a while and tried to compose a new entry for the guide on the subject of vogons but couldnt think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave that up too wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to the bridge as he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched excitedly over the instruments see the ships about to move into orbit trillian was saying theres a planet out there its at the exact coordinates you predicted zaphod heard a noise and looked up ford he hissed hey come and take a look at this ford went and had a look at it it was a series of figur es flashing over a screen you recognize those galactic coordinates said zaphod no ill give you a clue computer hi gang enthused the computer this is getting real sociable isnt it shut up said zaphod and show up the screens light on the bridge sank pinpoints of light played across the consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor screens there was absolutely nothing on them recognize that whispered zaphod ford frowned er no he said what do you see nothing recognize it what are you talking about were in the horsehead nebula one whole vast dark cloud and i was meant to recognize that from a blank screen inside a dark nebula is the only place in the galaxy youd see a dark screen very good zaphod laughed he was clearly very excited about something almost childishly so hey this is really terrific this is just far too much whats so great about being stuck in a dust cloud said ford what would you reckon to find here urged zaphod nothing no stars no planets no computer shouted zaphod rotate angle of vision through one ­‐ eighty degrees and dont talk about it for a moment it seemed that nothing was happening then a brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen a red star the size of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another one ʹ a binary system then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of th e picture ʹ a red glare shading away into the deep black the night side of the planet ive found it cried zaphod thumping the console ive found it ford stared at it in astonishment what is it he said that said zaphod is the most improbable planet that ever existed chapter excerpt from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy page section a entry magrathea far back in the mists of ancient time in the great and glorious days of the former galactic empire life was wild rich and largely tax free mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns seeking adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of galactic space in those days spirits were brave the stakes were high men were real men women were real women and small furry creatures from alpha centauri were real small furry creatures from alpha centauri and all dared to

natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor ʹ at least no one worth speaking of and for all the richest and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the worlds theyd settled on ʹ none of them was entirely satisfact ory either the climate wasnt quite right in the later part of the afternoon or the day was half an hour too long or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink and thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry cus tom­‐made luxury planet building the home of this industry was the planet magrathea where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets ʹ gold planets platinum planets soft rubber planets with lots of ea rthquakes ʹ all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the galaxys richest men naturally came to expect but so successful was this venture that magrathea itself soon became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the galaxy was reduced to abject poverty and so the system broke down the empire collapsed and a long sullen silence settled over a billion worlds disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the value of a p lanned political economy magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscurity of legend in these enlightened days of course no one believes a word of it chapter arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge ford was waving his arms about youre crazy zaphod he was saying magrathea is a myth a fairy story its what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to beco me economists its and thats what we are currently in orbit around insisted zaphod look i cant help what you may personally be in orbit around said ford but this ship computer shouted zaphod oh no hi there this is eddie your shipboard computer and im feeling just great guys and i know im just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any programme you care to run through me arthur looked inquiringly at trillian she motioned him to come on in but keep quiet compute r said zaphod tell us again what our present trajectory is a real pleasure feller it burbled we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of magrathea proving nothing said ford i wouldnt t rust that computer to speak my weight i can do that for you sure enthused the computer punching out more tickertape i can even work out you personality problems to ten decimal places if it will help trillian interrupted zaphod she said any minute now we will be swinging round to the daylight side of this planet adding whatever it turns out to be hey what do you mean by that the planets where i predicted it would be isnt it yes i know theres a planet there im not arguing with anyone its just that i wouldnt know magrathea from any other lump of cold rock dawns coming up if you want it ok ok muttered zaphod lets at least give our eyes a good time computer hi there what can i just shut up and give us a view of the planet again a dark featureless mass once more filled the screens ʹ the planet rolling away beneath them they watched for a moment in silence but zaphod was fidgety with excitement we are now traversing the night side he said in a hushed voice the planet rolled on the surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us he continued he was trying to restore a sense of occasion to what he felt should have been a great moment magrathea he was piqued by fords sceptical reaction magrathea in a few seconds he continued we should see there the moment carried itself even the most seasoned star tramp cant help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the galaxy out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light it crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade and within seconds two suns were visible furnaces of li ght searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them the fires of dawn breathed zaphod the twin suns of soulianis and rahm or whatever said ford quietly soulianis and rahm insisted zaphod the suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music floated through the bridge marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans so much as ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitemen t burnt inside him but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet it was enough for him to see it as it was it faintly irritated him that zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work for him all this magrathea non sense seemed juvenile isnt it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too all this magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to arthur he edged up to trillian and asked her what was going on i only know what zaphods told me she whispered apparently magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes in bit like atlantis on earth except that the legends say the magratheans used to manufact ure planets arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important suddenly he realized what it was is there any tea on this spaceship he asked more of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the heart of gold streaked along its orbital path the suns now stood high in the black sky the pyrotechnics of dawn were over and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day ʹ grey dusty and only dimly contoured it looked dead and cold as a crypt from time to time promising features would appear on the distant horizon ʹ ravines maybe mountains maybe even cities ʹ but as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire the planets surface was blurred by time by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century clearly it was very very old a moment of doubt came to ford as he watched the grey landscape move beneath them the immensity of time worried him he could feel it as a presence he cleared his throat well even supposing it is it is said zaphod which it isnt continue d ford what do you want with it anyway theres nothing there not on the surface said zaphod alright just supposing theres something i take it youre not here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all what are you after one of zaphods heads looked away the other one looked round to see what the first was looking at but it wasnt looking at anything very much well said zaphod airily its partly the curiosity partly a sense of adventure but mostly i think its t he fame and the money ford glanced at him sharply he got a very strong impression that zaphod hadnt the faintest idea why he was there at all you know i dont like the look of that planet at all said trillian shivering ah take no notice s aid zaphod with half the wealth of the former galactic empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to look frumpy bullshit thought ford even supposing this was the home of some ancient civilization now gone to dust even supposing a number of exceed ingly unlikely things there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now he shrugged i think its just a dead planet he said the suspense is killing me said arthur testily stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the galaxy and it is in order that this situation should not in any way be exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance the planet in question is in fa ct the legendary magrathea the deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a micecage the bruising of somebodys upper arm and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale in order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved no revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained the bruise this fact may safely be made the subject of su spense since it is of no significance whatsoever chapter after a fairly shaky start to the day arthurs mind was beginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left him with he had found a nutri ­‐matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost but not quite entirely unlike tea the way it functioned was very interesting when the drink button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the sub jects taste buds a spectroscopic analysis of the subjects metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subjects brain to see what was likely to go down well however no one knew quite why it d id this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost but not quite entirely unlike tea the nutri ­‐matic was designed and manufactured by the sirius cybernetics corporation whose complaints department now covers all the major land ma sses of the first three planets in the sirius tau star system arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving he glanced up at the screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past it suddenly occurred to him to ask a quest ion which had been bothering him is it safe he said magratheas been dead for five million years said zaphod of course its safe even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now at which point a strange and inexplicable soun d thrilled suddenly through the bridge ʹ a noise as of a distant fanfare a hollow reedy insubstantial sound it preceded a voice that was equally hollow reedy and insubstantial the voice said greetings to you someone from the dead planet was tal king to them computer shouted zaphod hi there what the photon is it oh just some five ­‐million ­‐year ­‐old tape thats being broadcast at us a what a recording shush said ford its carrying on the voice was old courteous almost charming but was underscored with quite unmistakable menace this is a recorded announcement it said as im afraid were all out at the moment the commercial council of magrathea thanks you for your esteemed vis it a voice from ancient magrathea shouted zaphod ok ok said ford but regrets continued the voice that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business thank you if you would care to leave your name and the address of a plane t where you can be contacted kindly speak when you hear the tone a short buzz followed then silence they want to get rid of us said trillian nervously what do we do its just a recording said zaphod we keep going got that computer i got it said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed they waited after a second or so came the fanfare once again and then the voice we would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements when our clients will once again be able to select from all thats best in contemporary geography the men ace in the voice took on a sharper edge meanwhile we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave now arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions well i suppose wed better be going then hadnt we he sugges ted shhh said zaphod theres absolutely nothing to be worried about then whys everyone so tense theyre just interested shouted zaphod computer start a descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing this time the fanfare was qu ite perfunctory the voice distinctly cold it is most gratifying it said that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a special se rvice we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail we look forward to your custom in future lives thank you the voice snapped off oh said trillian er said arthur well said ford look said zaphod will you get it into your heads thats just a recorded message its millions of years old it doesnt apply to us get it what said trillian quietly about the missiles missiles dont make me laugh ford tapped zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship a quick change of magnification brought them into close focus ʹ two massi vely real rockets thundering through the sky the suddenness of it was shocking i think theyre going to have a very good try at applying to us said ford zaphod stared at them in astonishment hey this is terrific he said someone down there is trying to kill us terrific said arthur but dont you see what this means yes were going to die yes but apart from that apart from that it means we must be on to something how soon can we get off it second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became larger they had swung round now on to a direct homing course so that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads head on as a matter of interest said trillian what are we going to do just keep cool said zaphod is that all shouted arthur no were also going to er take evasive action said zaphod with a sudden access of panic computer what evasive action can we take er none im afraid guys said the computer or something said zaphod er he said there seems to be something jamming my guidance system explained the computer brightly impact minus forty ­‐five seconds please call me eddie if it wil l help you to relax zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions simultaneously right he said er weve got to get manual control of this ship can you fly her asked ford pleasantly no can you no trillian can you no fine said zaphod relaxing well do it together i cant either said arthur who felt it was time he began to assert himself id guessed that said zaphod ok computer i want full manual control now you got it said the computer several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up out of them showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled ­‐up cellophane these controls had never been used before zaphod stared at them wildly ok ford he said full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard or something good luck guys chirped the computer impact minus thirty seconds ford leapt to the controls ʹ only a few of them made any immediate sense to him so he pulled those the ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously he released half of them and the ship span round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come straight towards the oncoming missiles air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against them for a few seconds the inertial forces held them flattened and squirming for breath unable to move zap hod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system the lever snapped off the ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards the crew were hurled violently back across the cabin fords copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy smashed into another section of the control console with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling antarean parakeet gland s out of antares an antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots and the ship su ddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone it was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm this should be emphasized because as had already been revealed they escape otherwise completely unh armed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship the safety of the crew is absolutely assured impact minus twenty seconds guys said the computer then turn the bloody engines back on bawled zaphod ok sure thing guys said the computer with a subtle roar the engines cut back in the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again the computer started to sing when you walk through the storm it whined nasally hold your head u p high zaphod screamed at it to shut up but his voice was lost in the din of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction and dont be afraid of the dark eddie wailed the ship in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems at the end of the storm crooned eddie the two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship is a golden sky but by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship and they passed right under it and the sweet silver songs of the lark revised impact time fifteen seconds fellas walk on through the wind the missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back into pursuit this is it said arthur watching them we are now quite definitely going to die arent we i wish youd stop s aying that shouted ford well we are arent we yes walk on through the rain sang eddie a thought struck arthur he struggled to his feet why doesnt anyone turn on this improbability drive thing he said we could probably reach that what are you crazy said zaphod without proper programming anything could happen does that matter at this stage shouted arthur though your dreams be tossed and blown sand eddie arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces of moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling walk on walk on with hope in your heart does anyone know why arthur cant turn on the improbability drive shout ed trillian and youll never walk alone impact minus five seconds its been great knowing you guys god bless youll ne ver walk alone i said yelled trillian does anyone know the next thing that happened was a mid ­‐mangling e xplosion of noise and light chapter and the next thing that happened after that was that the heart of gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior it was somewhat larger and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue in the centre a s piral staircase leading nowhere in particular stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservato ry overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble ­‐topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought ­‐iron legs as you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague forms of inst ruments became visible and as you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your hands looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the required data readouts though it was far from clear where they were reflecte d from it was in fact sensationally beautiful relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair zaphod beeblebrox said what the hell happened well i was just saying said arthur lounging by a small fish pool theres this improbability drive switch over here he waved at where it had been there was a potted plant there now but where are we said ford who was sitting on the spiral staircase a nicely chilled pan galactic gargle blaster in his hand exactly where we were i think said trillian as all about them the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape of magrathea which still scooted along beneath them zaphod leapt out of his seat then whats happened to the missiles he said a new and astounding image appeared in the mirr ors they would appear said ford doubtfully to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale at an improbability factor cut in eddie who hadnt changed a bit of eight million seven hundred and sixty ­‐seven thousand one hundred and twenty ­‐eight to one against zaphod stared at arthur did you think of that earthman he demanded well said arthur all i did was thats very good thinking you know turn on the improbability drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens hey kid you just saved our lives you know that oh said arthur well it was nothing really was it said zaphod oh well forget it then ok computer take us in to land but i said forget it another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface o f an alien planet and since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more this is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it ah whats happening it thought er excuse me who am i hello why am i here whats my purpose in life what do i mean by who am i calm down ge t a grip now oh this is an interesting sensation what is it its a sort of yawning tingling sensation in my my well i suppose id better start finding names for things if i want to make any headway in what for the sake of what i shall call an argument i shall call the world so lets call it my stomach good ooooh its getting quite strong and hey whats about this whistling roaring sound going past what im suddenly going to call my head perhaps i can call that wind is that a good name itll do perhaps i can find a better name for it later when ive found out what its for it must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it hey whats this thing this lets call it a tail ʹ yeah tail hey i can really thrash it about pretty good cant i wow wow that feels great doesnt seem to achieve very much but ill probably find out what its for later on now ʹ have i built up any coherent picture of things yet no never mind hey t his is really exciting so much to find out about so much to look forward to im quite dizzy with anticipation or is it the wind there really is a lot of that now isnt it and wow hey whats this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast very very fast so big and flat and round it needs a big wide sounding name like ow ound round ground thats it thats a good name ʹ ground i wonder if it will be friends with me and the rest after a sudden wet thud was silence curiously enough the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was oh no not again many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now chapter are we taking this robot with us said ford looking with distaste at marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the heart of gold had now landed oh the paranoid android he said yeah well take him but what are supposed to do with a manically d epressed robot you think youve got problems said marvin as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot no dont bother to answer that im fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even i dont know the answer it gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level trillian burst in through the door from her cabin my white mice have escaped she said an expression of deep worry and concern failed to cros s either of zaphods faces nuts to your white mice he said trillian glared an upset glare at him and disappeared again it is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realized that human beings were onl y the third most intelligent life form present on the planet earth instead of as was generally thought by most independent observers the second good afternoon boys the voice was oddly familiar but oddly different it had a matriarchal twang it announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the planet surface they looked at each other in puzzlement its the computer explained zaphod i discovered it had an emergency back ­‐up personality that i thought might work out better now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new planet continued eddies new voice so i want you all wrapped up snug and warm and no playing with any naughty bug ­‐eyed monsters zaphod tapped impatient ly on the hatch im sorry he said i think we might be better off with a slide rule right snapped the computer who said that will you open the exit hatch please computer said zaphod trying not to get angry not until whoever said tha t owns up urged the computer stamping a few synapses closed oh god muttered ford slumped against a bulkhead and started to count to ten he was desperately worried that one day sentinent life forms would forget how to do this only by counting could humans demonstrate their independence of computers come on said eddie sternly computer began zaphod im waiting interrupted eddie i can wait all day if necessary computer said zaphod again who had been trying to think of some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with and had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground if you dont open that exit hatch this moment i shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe got that eddie shocked paused and considered this ford carried on counting quietly this is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying blood blood blood blood finally eddie said quietly i can see this relationship is s omething were all going to have to work at and the hatchway opened an icy wind ripped into them they hugged themselves warmly and stepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of magrathea itll all end in tears i know it shouted eddie after them and closed the hatchway again a few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again in response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise chapter five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land bits of it were dullish grey bits of it dullish brown the rest of it rather less interesting to look at it was like a dried ­‐out marsh now barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick it was very cold zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it he stalked off by himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground the wind stung arthurs eyes and ears and the stale thin air clasped his throat however the thing stu ng most was his mind its fantastic he said and his own voice rattled his ears sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere desolate hole if you ask me said ford i could have more fun in a cat litter he felt a mounting irritation of all t he planets in all the star systems of all the galaxy ʹ didnt he just have to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway not even a hot dog stand in evidence he stooped down and picked up a cold clot of earth but there was nothi ng underneath it worth crossing thousands of light years to look at no insisted arthur dont you understand this is the first time ive actually stood on the surface of another planet a whole alien world pity its such a dump though trillian hugged herself shivered and frowned she could have sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye but when she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship still and silent a hundred yards or so behind them she was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join him he seemed to be excited but they couldnt clearly hear what he was saying because of the thinnish at mosphere and the wind as they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it seemed to be circular ʹ a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was spattered with black and red lumps they stopped and looked at a piece it was wet it was rubbery with horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat at the top of the craters lip they met zaphod look he said pointing into the crater in the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadnt lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot the silence was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of trillians throat i suppose theres no point in trying to bu ry it murmured arthur and then wished he hadnt come said zaphod and started back down into the crater what down there said trillian with severe distaste yeah said zaphod come on ive got something to show you we can see it said trillian not that said zaphod something else come on they all hesitated come on insisted zaphod ive found a way in in said arthur in horror into the interior of the planet an underground passage the force of the whales impac t cracked it open and thats where we have to go where no man has trod these five million years into the very depths of time itself marvin started his ironical humming again zaphod hit him and he shut up with little shudders of disgust they all followed zaphod down the incline into the crater trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate creator life said marvin dolefully loathe it or ignore it you cant like it the ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a network of galleries and passages now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails zaphod had made a start clearing a way into one of them but marvin was able to do it rather faster dank air wafted out of its dark recesses and as zaphod shone a torch into it little was visible in the dusty gloom according to the legends he said the magratheans lived most of their lives underground whys that said arthur did the surface become too polluted or overpopulated no i dont think so said zaphod i think they just didnt like it very much are you sure you know what youre doing said trillian peering nervously into the darkness weve been attacked once already you know look kid i promise you the liv e population of this planet is nil plus the four of us so come on lets get on in there er hey earthman arthur said arthur yeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of the passageway ok guard said arthur what from you just said theres no one here yeah well just for safety ok said zaphod whose yours or mine good lad ok here we go zaphod scrambled down into the passage followed by trillian and ford well i hope you all have a really miserable time complained arthur dont worry marvin assured him they will in a few seconds they had disappeared from view arthur stamped around in a huff and then decided that a whales graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in marvin eyed him balefully for a moment and then turned himself off zaphod marched quickly down the passageway nervous as hell but trying to hide it by striding purposefully he flung the torch beam around the walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the touch the air thick with decay there what did i tell you he said an inhabited planet magrathea and he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile floor trillian was re minded unavoidably of the london underground though it was less thoroughly squalid at intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics ʹ simple angular patterns in bright colours trillian stopped and studied one of them but could not inter pret any sense in them she called to zaphod hey have you any idea what these strange symbols are i think theyre just strange symbols of some kind said zaphod hardly glancing back trillian shrugged and hurried after him from time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish chambers which ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment he dragged zaphod into one to have a look trillian followed look said ford you reckon this is magrathea yeah sai d zaphod and we heard the voice right ok so ive bought the fact that its magrathea ʹ for the moment what you have so far said nothing about is how in the galaxy you found it you didnt just look it up in a star atlas thats for sure resear ch government archives detective work few lucky guesses easy and then you stole the heart of gold to come and look for it with i stole it to look for a lot of things a lot of things said ford in surprise like what i dont know what i dont know what im looking for why not because because i think it might be because if i knew i wouldnt be able to look for them what are you crazy its a possibility i havent ruled out yet said zaphod quietly i only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions and its current conditions are not good for a long time nobody said anything as ford gazed at zaph od with a mind suddenly full of worry listen old friend if you want to started ford eventually no wait ill tell you something said zaphod i freewheel a lot i get an idea to do something and hey why not i do it i reckon ill become president of the galaxy and it just happens its easy i decide to steal this ship i decide to look for magrathea and it all just happens yeah i work out how it can best be done right but it always works out its like having a galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send off the cheques and then whenever i stop and think ʹ why did i want to do something ʹ how did i work out how to do it ʹ i get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it like i have now its a big effort to talk about it zaphod paused for a while for a while there was silence then he frowned and said last night i was worrying about this again about the fac t that part of my mind just didnt seem to work properly then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with without telling me about it i put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that s omebody had locked off part of my mind for that purpose which was why i couldnt use it i wondered if there was a way i could check i went to the ships medical bay and plugged myself into the encephelographic screen i went through every major screen ing test on both my heads ʹ all the tests i had to go through under government medical officers before my nomination for presidency could be properly ratified they showed up nothing nothing unexpected at least they showed that i was clever imaginative irresponsible untrustworthy extrovert nothing you couldnt have guessed and no other anomalies so i started inventing further tests completely at random nothing then i tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the results from the ot her head still nothing finally i got silly because id given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia last thing i did before i packed it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter you remember i was always superstitious about the color green when i was a kid i always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts ford nodded and there it was said zaphod clear as day a whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other a nd not to anything else around them some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically traumatised those two lumps of cerebellum ford stared at him aghast trillian had turned white somebody did that to you whispered ford yeah but have you any idea who or why why i can only guess but i do know who the bastard was you know how do you know because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses they left them there for me to see ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl initials burnt into your brain yeah well what were they for gods sake zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment then he looked away zb he said at that moment a steel shutter sl ammed down behind them and gas started to pour into the chamber ill tell you about it later choked zaphod as all three passed out chapter on the surface of magrathea arthur wandered about moodily ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy to while away the time with he pushed a few buttons at random the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seem ed to its editors like a good idea at the time one of these the one arthur now came across supposedly relates the experiences of one veet voojagig a quiet young student at the university of maximegalon who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical perception and then after a night of drinking pan galactic gargle blasters with zaphod beeblebrox became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened t o all the biros hed bought over the past few years there followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caugh t the public imagination at the time somewhere in the cosmos he said along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids reptiloids fishoids walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms and it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle responding to highly biro­‐oriented stimuli an d generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life and as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until veet voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet and to have worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables whereupon he was taken away locked up wrote a book and was finally sent into tax exile which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public when one day an expedition was sent to th e spatial coordinates that voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true though he was later discovered to be lying there did however remain the question of both the mysterious altairan dollars paid yearly into his brantisvogan bank account and of course zaphod beeblebroxs highly profitable second ­‐hand biro business arthur read this and put the book down the robot still sat there co mpletely inert arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater he walked around the crater he watched two suns set magnificently over magrathea he went back down into the crater he woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is bett er to talk to than nobody nights falling he said look robot the stars are coming out from the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars and only very faintly but they were there to be seen the robot obediently looked at them then looked back i know he said wretched isnt it but that sunset ive never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams the two suns it was like mountains of fire boiling into space ive seen it sa id marvin its rubbish we only ever had the one sun at home persevered arthur i came from a planet called earth you know i know said marvin you keep going on about it it sounds awful ah no it was a beautiful place did it have oc eans oh yes said arthur with a sigh great wide rolling blue oceans cant bear oceans said marvin tell me inquired arthur do you get on well with other robots hate them said marvin where are you going arthur couldnt bear any more he had got up again i think ill just take another walk he said dont blame you said marvin and counted five hundred and ninety ­‐seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later arthur slappe d his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job he trudged back up the wall of the crater because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark because of this arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed him chapter he was standing with his back to arthur watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon he was tallish elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe when he turned his face was thin and distinguished careworn but not unkind the sort of face you would happily bank with but he didnt turn yet not even to react to arthurs yelp of surprise eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely and he turned his face was still illuminated from somewhere and when arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some kind ʹ a small hovercraft arthur guessed it she d a dim pool of light around it the man looked at arthur sadly it seemed you choose a cold night to visit our dead planet he said who who are you stammered arthur the man looked away again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his face my name is not important he said he seemed to have something on his mind conversation was clearly something he felt he didnt have to rush at arthur felt awkward i er you startled me he said lamely the man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows hmmmm he said i said you startled me do not be alarmed i will not harm you arthur frowned at him but you shot at us there were missiles he said the man chuckled slightly an automatic system he said and gave a small sigh ancient computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks i think they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony he looked gravely at arthur and said im a great fan of science you know oh er really said arthur who was beginning to find the mans curious kindly manner disconcerting oh yes said the old man and simply stopped talking again ah said arthur er he had an odd felling of being like a man in the act of adultery who is surprised when the womans husband wanders into the room changes his trousers passes a few idle remarks about the weather and leaves again you seem ill at e ase said the old man with polite concern er no well yes actually you see we werent really expecting to find anybody about in fact i sort of gathered that you were all dead or something dead said the old man good gracious no we have but slept slept said arthur incredulously yes through the economic recession you see said the old man apparently unconcerned about whether arthur understood a word he was talking about or not er economic recession well you see five m illion years ago the galactic economy collapsed and seeing that custom ­‐made planets are something of a luxury commodity you see he paused and looked at arthur you know we built planets do you he asked solemnly well yes said arthur id sor t of gathered fascinating trade said the old man and a wistful look came into his eyes doing the coastlines was always my favourite used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords so anyway he said trying to find his thread again the recession came and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if we just slept through it so we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over the man stifled a very slight yawn and continued the computers were index linked to the galactic stock market prices you see so that wed all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services arthur a regular guardian reader was deeply shocked at this thats a pretty unpleasant way to behave isnt it is it asked the old man mildly im sorry im a bit out of touch he pointed down into the crater is that robot yours he said no came a thin metallic voice from the crater im mine if youd call it a robot mu ttered arthur its more a sort of electronic sulking machine bring it said the old man arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision suddenly present in the old mans voice he called to marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame which he wasnt on second thoughts said the old man leave it here you must come with me great things are afoot he turned towards his craft which though no apparent signal had been given now drifted quietly towards them through the dark arthur looked down at marvin who now made an equally big show of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater again muttering sour nothings to himself come called the old man come now or you will be late late said arthur what for what is your name human dent arthur dent said arthur late as in the late dentarthurdent said the old man sternly its a sort of threat you see another wistful look came into his tired old eyes ive ne ver been very good at them myself but im told they can be very effective arthur blinked at him what an extraordinary person he muttered to himself i beg your pardon said the old man oh nothing im sorry said arthur in embarrassment a lright where do we go in my aircar said the old man motioning arthur to get into the craft which had settled silently next to them we are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its five ­‐million ­‐year slumber magrathea awakes arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man the strangeness of it the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled him he looked at the old man his face il luminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel excuse me he said to him what is your name by the way my name said the old man and the same distant sadness came into his face again he paused my name he said is slartibartfast arthur practically choked i beg your pardon he spluttered slartibartfast repeated the old man quietly slartibartfast the old man looked at him gravely i said it wasnt important he said the aircar sailed through the night chapter it is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem for instance on the planet earth man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much ʹ the wheel new york wars and so on ʹ whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time but conversely the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man ʹ for precisely the same reasons curiously enough the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the danger but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch foot balls or whistle for tidbits so they eventually gave up and left the earth by their own means shortly before the vogons arrived the last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double ­‐backwards ­‐somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the star sprangled banner but in fact the message was this so long and thanks for all the fish in fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins and they spent a lot of their time in beha vioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man the fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these creatures plans chap ter silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness a single soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep magrathean night it sped swiftly arthurs companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts and when arthur tried on a couple of occas ions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was comfortable enough and then left it at that arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any re ference points the sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds had grown so much in size that arthur realized it was travelling t owards them at a colossal speed and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be he peered at it but was unable to discern any clear shape and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be a collision course their relative velocity seemed unbelievable and arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over the next thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him he twisted his head sharply round a nd saw a small black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them and it took him several seconds to realize what had happened they had plunged into a tunnel in the ground the colossal speed had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground the mouth of the tunnel the insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were shooting apparently at several hundred miles an hour he closed his eyes in terror after a length of time which he made no attempt to judge he sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt he opened his eyes again they were still in the silver tunnel threading and weaving thei r way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of converging tunnels when they finally stopped it was in a small chamber of curved steel several tunnels also had their terminus here and at the farther end of the chamber arthur could see a large c ircle of dim irritating light it was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes it was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far it was arthur guessed quite wrongly that it might be ultra violet slartibartfast turned and rega rded arthur with his solemn old eyes earthman he said we are now deep in the heart of magrathea how did you know i was an earthman demanded arthur these things will become clear to you said the old man gently at least he added with sl ight doubt in his voice clearer than they are at the moment he continued i should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not literally exist within our planet it is a little too large we are about to pass through a gateway int o a vast tract of hyperspace it may disturb you arthur made nervous noises slartibartfast touched a button and added not entirely reassuringly it scares the willies out of me hold tight the car shot forward straight into the circle of light a nd suddenly arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like it wasnt infinity in fact infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity ʹ distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaning less the chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite it was just very very big so that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself arthurs senses bobbed and span as travelling at the immense speed he knew the aircar attained they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them the wall the wall defied the imagination ʹ seduced it and defeated it the wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top bottom and sides passed away beyond the reach of sight the mere shock of vertigo could kill a man the wall appeared perfectly flat it would take the finest laser meas uring equipment to detect that as it climbed apparently to infinity as it dropped dizzily away as it planed out to either side it also curved it met itself again thirteen light seconds away in other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere a sphere over three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light welcome said slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar travelling now at three times the speed of sound crept imperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space welcome he said to our factory floor arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror ranged away before them at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at were a series of curious suspensions delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space this said slartibartfast is where we make most of our planets you see you mean said arthur trying to form the words you mean youre starting it all up again now no no good heavens no exclaimed the old man no the gala xy isnt nearly rich enough to support us yet no weve been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very special clients from another dimension it may interest you there in the distance in front of us arthur followed the old m ans finger till he was able to pick out the floating structure he was pointing out it was indeed the only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it though this was more a sublimal impression than anything one could put ones finger on at the moment however a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within patterns that arthur knew rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of words part of the furniture of his mind for a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction the flash came again and this time there could be no doubt the earth wh ispered arthur well the earth mark two in fact said slartibartfast cheerfully were making a copy from our original blueprints there was a pause are you trying to tell me said arthur slowly and with control that you originally made th e earth oh yes said slartibartfast did you ever go to a place i think it was called norway no said arthur no i didnt pity said slartibartfast that was one of mine won an award you know lovely crinkly edges i was most upset t o hear about its destruction you were upset yes five minutes later and it wouldnt have mattered so much it was a quite shocking cock ­‐up huh said arthur the mice were furious the mice were furious oh yes said the old man mildly yes well so i expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses but ah but they hadnt paid for it you see had they look said arthur would it save you a lot of time if i just gave up and went mad now for a while the aircar fle w on in awkward silence then the old man tried patiently to explain earthman the planet you lived on was commissioned paid for and run by mice it was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built and weve got to build another one only one word registered with arthur mice he said indeed earthman look sorry ʹ are we talking about the little white furry things with the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit coms slartibartfast coughed politely earthman he said it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech reme mber i have been asleep inside this planet of magrathea for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak these creatures you call mice you see they are not quite as they appear they are merely the protrusion int o our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan ­‐dimensional beings the whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front the old man paused and with a sympathetic frown continued theyve been experimenting on you im afraid arthur th ought about this for a second and then his face cleared ah no he said i see the source of the misunderstanding now no look you see what happened was that we used to do experiments on them they were often used in behavioural research pavlov and all that sort of stuff so what happened was hat the mice would be set all sorts of tests learning to ring bells run around mazes and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be examined from our observations of their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about our own arthurs voice tailed off such subtlety said slartibartfast one has to admire it what said arthur how better to disguise their real natures and how better to guide your thinking suddenly running down a maze the wrong way eating the wrong bit of cheese unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis ʹ if its finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous he paused for effect you see earthman they really are particularly clever hyperintelligent pan ­‐dimensional beings your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten ­‐million ­‐year research programme let me tell you the whole story itll take a little time time said arthur weakly is not currently one of my problems chapter there are of course many problems connected with life of which some of the most popular are why are people born why do they die why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pan ­‐ dimensional beings whose physical manifestation in their own pan ­‐ dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of brockian ultra cricket a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all and to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been connected up it had started from i think therefore i am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off it was the size of a small city its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest ultramahagony topped with rich ultrared leather the dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room and stately windows looked out upon a tree ­‐lined public square on the day of the great on ­‐turning two soberly dressed programmers with brief cases ar rived and were shown discreetly into the office they were aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the desk opened t heir brief cases and took out their leather ­‐bound notebooks their names were lunkwill and fook for a few moments they sat in respectful silence then after exchanging a quiet glance with fook lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black panel the subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total active mode after a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep it said what is this great task for which i deep thought the second greatest computer in the unive rse of time and space have been called into existence lunkwill and fook glanced at each other in surprise your task o computer began fook no wait a minute this isnt right said lunkwill worried we distinctly designed this computer to b e the greatest one ever and were not making do with second best deep thought he addressed the computer are you not as we designed you to be the greatest most powerful computer in all time i described myself as the second greatest intoned deep thought and such i am another worried look passed between the two programmers lunkwill cleared his throat there must be some mistake he said are you not a greatest computer than the milliard gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a sta r in a millisecond the milliard gargantubrain said deep thought with unconcealed contempt a mere abacus ʹ mention it not and are you not said fook leaning anxiously forward a greater analyst than the googleplex star thinker in the seventh g alaxy of light and ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five ­‐week dangrabad beta sand blizzard a five ­‐week sand blizzard said deep thought haughtily you ask this of me who have contemplated the ver y vectors of the atoms in the big bang itself molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff the two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment then lunkwill leaned forward again but are you not he said a more fiendish disputant tha n the great hyperlobic omni ­‐cognate neutron wrangler of ciceronicus the magic and indefatigable the great hyperlobic omni ­‐cognate neutron wrangler said deep thought thoroughly rolling the rs could talk all four legs off an arcturan megadonkey ʹ but only i could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards then what asked fook is the problem there is no problem said deep thought with magnificent ringing tones i am simply the second greatest computer in the universe of space and time but the second insisted lunkwill why do you keep saying the second youre surely not thinking of the multicorticoid perspicutron titan muller are you or the pondermatic or the contemptuous lights flashed across the computers console i sp are not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons he boomed i speak of none but the computer that is to come after me fook was losing patience he pushed his notebook aside and muttered i think this is getting needlessly messianic you know nothing of future time pronounced deep thought and yet in my teeming circuitry i can navigate the infinite delta streams of future probability and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational parameters i am not worth y to calculate but which it will be my fate eventually to design fook sighed heavily and glanced across to lunkwill can we get on and ask the question he said lunkwill motioned him to wait what computer is this of which you speak he asked i will speak of it no further in this present time said deep thought now ask what else of me you will that i may function speak they shrugged at each other fook composed himself o deep thought computer he said the task we have designed you to perform is this we want you to tell us he paused the answer the answer said deep thought the answer to what life urged fook the universe said lunkwill everything they said in chorus deep thought paused for a momen ts reflection tricky he said finally but can you do it again a significant pause yes said deep thought i can do it there is an answer said fook with breathless excitement a simple answer added lunkwill yes said deep tho ught life the universe and everything there is an answer but he added ill have to think about it a sudden commotion destroyed the moment the door flew open and two angry men wearing the coarse faded ʹ blue robes and belts of the cruxwan univ ersity burst into the room thrusting aside the ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way we demand admission shouted the younger of the two men elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat come on shouted the older one you cant keep us out he pushed a junior programmer back through the door we demand that you cant keep us out bawled the younger one though he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made to stop him who are you said lunkwill risi ng angrily from his seat what do you want i am majikthise announced the older one and i demand that i am vroomfondel shouted the younger one majikthise turned on vroomfondel its alright he explained angrily you dont need to demand th at alright bawled vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk i am vroomfondel and that is not a demand that is a solid fact what we demand is solid facts no we dont exclaimed majikthise in irritation that is precisely what we dont demand scarcely pausing for breath vroomfondel shouted we dont demand solid facts what we demand is a total absence of solid facts i demand that i may or may not be vroomfondel but who the devil are you exclaimed an outraged fook we said majikth ise are philosophers though we may not be said vroomfondel waving a warning finger at the programmers yes we are insisted majikthise we are quite definitely here as representatives of the amalgamated union of philosophers sages luminaries and other thinking persons and we want this machine off and we want it off now whats the problem said l unkwill ill tell you what the problem is mate said majikthise demarcation thats the problem we demand yelled vroomfondel that demarcation may or may not be the problem you just let the machines get on with the adding up warned majik thise and well take care of the eternal verities thank you very much you want to check your legal position you do mate under law the quest for ultimate truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers any bloody machine goe s and actually finds it and were straight out of a job arent we i mean whats the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may or may not be a god if this machine only goes and gives us his bleeding phone number the next morning that s right shouted vroomfondel we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room might i make an observation at this point inquired deep thought well go on strike yelled vroomfondel thats right agreed majikthise youll have a national philosophers strike on your hands the hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass driver units mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the room cut in to give deep thoughts voice a little more power all i wanted to say bellowed the computer is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything ʹ he pau sed and satisfied himself that he now had everyones attention before continuing more quietly but the programme will take me a little while to run fook glanced impatiently at his watch how long he said seven and a half million years said deep thought lunkwill and fook blinked at each other seven and a half million years they cried in chorus yes declaimed deep thought i said id have to think about it didnt i and it occurs to me tha t running a programme like this is bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in general everyones going to have their own theories about what answer im eventually to come up with and who better to capitali ze on that media market than you yourself so long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular press you can keep yourself on the gravy train for life how does that sound the two philosophers gaped at him bloody hell said majikthise now that is what i call thinking here vroomfondel why do we never think of things like that dunno said vroomfondel in an awed whisper think our brains must be too highly trained majikthise so sa ying they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams chapter yes very salutary said arthur after slartibartfast had related the salient points of the story to him but i dont understand what all this has got to do with the earth and mice and things that is but the first half of the story earthman said t he old man if you would care to discover what happened seven and a half millions later on the great day of the answer allow me to invite you to my study where you can experience the events yourself on our sens ­‐o­‐tape records that is unless you would c are to take a quick stroll on the surface of new earth its only half completed im afraid ʹ we havent even finished burying the artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet then we have the tertiary and quarternary periods of the cenozoic era to lay down and no thank you said arthur it wouldnt be quite the same no said slartibartfast it wont be and he turned the aircar round and headed back towards the mind ­‐numbing wall chapter slartibartfasts study was a total mess like the results of an explosion in a public library the old man frowned as they stepped in terribly unfortunate he said a diode blew in one of the life ­‐ support computers when we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered theyd been dead f or nearly thirty thousand years whos going to clear away the bodies thats what i want to know look why dont you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in he gestured arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out of the r ib cage of a stegosaurus it was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus explained the old man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments here he said hold these and passed a coup le of stripped wire end to arthur the instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him he was suspended in mid ­‐air and totally invisible to himself beneath him was a pretty treelined city square and all around it as far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse for wear ʹ many were cracked and stained with rain today however the sun was shining a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees and the odd sensation that all the buil dings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited people somewhere a band was playing brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the breeze and the spirit of carni val was in the air arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so much as a body to his name but before he had time to reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and called for everyones attention a man standin g on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a tannoy o people waiting in the shadow of deep thought he cried out honoured descendants of vroomfondel and majikthise the greatest and most truly interesting pundits the universe has ever known the time of waiting is over wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd flags streamers and wolf whistles sailed through the air the narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled ov er on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air seven and a half million years our race has waited for this great and hopefully enlightening day cried the cheer leader the day of the answer hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd never again cried the man never again will we wake up in the morning and think who am i what is my purpose in life does it really cosmically speaking matter if i dont get up and go to work for today we will finally learn once and for all the plai n and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of life the universe and everything as the crowd erupted once again arthur found himself gliding through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the first floor of the build ing behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd he experienced a moments panic as he sailed straight through towards the window which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right through the solid glass without appare ntly touching it no one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival which is hardly surprising as he wasnt there he began to realize that the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked six­‐track seventy ­‐millimetre into a cocked hat the room was m uch as slartibartfast had described it in seven and a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century or so the ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges the carpet a little faded now but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desks leather top as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited the time is nearly upon us said one and arthur was surprised to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the mans neck the word was loonquawl and it flashed a couple of times and the disappeared again before arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word phouchg appeared by his neck seventy ­‐five thousand generations ago our ancestors set this program in motion the second man said and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak an awesome prospect phouchg agreed the first man and arthur suddenly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles we are the ones who will hear said phouchg the answer to the great question of life the universe said loonquawl and everything shhh said loonquawl with a slight gesture i think dee p thought is preparing to speak there was a moments expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on the front of the console lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern a soft low hum came from the commu nication channel good morning said deep thought at last er good morning o deep thought said loonquawl nervously do you have er that is an answer for you interrupted deep thought majestically yes i have the two men shivered with expectancy their waiting had not been in vain there really is one breathed phouchg there really is one confirmed deep thought to everything to the great question of life the universe and everything yes both of the men had been trained for this moment their lives had been a preparation for it they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children and youre ready to give it to us urged loonquawl i am now now said deep thought they both licked their dry lips though i dont think added deep thought that youre going to like it doesnt matter said phouchg we must know it now now inquired deep thoug ht yes now alright said the computer and settled into silence again the two men fidgeted the tension was unbearable youre really not going to like it observed deep thought tell us alright said deep thought the answer to the great question yes of life the universe and everything said deep thought yes is said deep thought and paused yes is yes forty ­‐two said deep tho ught with infinite majesty and calm chapter it was a long time before anyone spoke out of the corner of his eye phouchg could see the sea of tense expectant faces down in the square outside were going to get lynched arent we he whispered it was a tough assignment said deep thought mildly forty ­‐two yelled loonquawl is that all youve got to show for seven and a half million years work i checked it very thoroughly said t he computer and that quite definitely is the answer i think the problem to be quite honest with you is that youve never actually known what the question is but it was the great question the ultimate question of life the universe and everything howled loonquawl yes said deep thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly but what actually is it a slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other well you know its just everythin g everything offered phouchg weakly exactly said deep thought so once you do know what the question actually is youll know what the answer means oh terrific muttered phouchg flinging aside his notebook and wiping away a tiny tear look alright alright said loonquawl can you just please tell us the question the ultimate question yes of life the universe and everything yes deep thought pondered this for a moment tricky he said but can you do it cr ied loonquawl deep thought pondered this for another long moment finally no he said firmly both men collapsed on to their chairs in despair but ill tell you who can said deep thought they both looked up sharply who tell us sudden ly arthur began to feel his apparently non ­‐existent scalp begin to crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably forward towards the console but it was only a dramatic zoom on the part of whoever had made the recording he assumed i speak of no ne other than the computer that is to come after me intoned deep thought his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones a computer whose merest operational parameters i am not worthy to calculate ʹ and yet i will design it for you a computer wh ich can calculate the question to the ultimate answer a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix and you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigat e its ten ­‐million ­‐year program yes i shall design this computer for you and i shall name it also unto you and it shall be called the earth phouchg gaped at deep thought what a dull name he said and great incisions appeared down the length of his body loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrific gashed from nowhere the computer console blotched and cracked the walls flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upwards into its own ceiling slartibartfast was standing in front of arthur hold ing the two wires end of the tape he explained chapter zaphod wake up mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr hey come on wake up just let me stick to what im good at yeah muttered zaphod and rolled away from the voice back to sleep do you want me to kick you said ford would it give you a lot of pleasure said zaphod blearily no nor me so whats the point stop bugging me zaphod curled himself up he got a double dose of the gas said trillian looking down at him two windpipes and stop talking said zaphod its hard enough trying to sleep anyway whats the matter with the ground its all cold and hard its gold said ford with an amazingly balletic movement zaphod was standing and scanning the horizon because that was how far the gold ground stretched in every direction perfectly smooth and solid it gleamed like its impossible to say what it gleamed like because noth ing in the universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet of solid gold does who put all that there yelped zaphod goggle ­‐eyed dont get excited said ford its only a catalogue a who a catalogue said trillian an illusion how can you say that cried zaphod falling to his hands and knees and staring at the ground he poked it and prodded it with his fingernail it was very heavy and very slightly soft ʹ he could mark it with his fingernail it was very yellow and very shiny and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold trillian and i came round a while ago said ford we shouted and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shoutin g and yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us this is all sens ­‐o­‐tape zaphod stared at him bitterly ah shit he said you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream t o show me somebody elses he sat down in a huff whats that series of valleys over there he said hallmark said ford we had a look we didnt wake you earlier said trillian the last planet was knee deep in fish fish some people like the oddest things and before that said ford we had platinum bit dull we thought youd like to see this one though seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked very pretty said zaphod petulantly in the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared it flickered and changed and when they looked around again so had the land as with one voice they all went yuch the sea was purple the beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green pebbles ʹ presumably terribly precious stones the mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassles in the sky a huge sign appeared replacing the catalogue number it said whatever your tastes magrathea can cater for you we are not proud and five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes in a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime meadow full of cows ow sai d zaphod my brains you want to talk about it said ford yeah ok said zaphod and all three sat down and ignored the scenes that came and went around them i figure this said zaphod whatever happened to my mind i did it and i did it in such a way that it wouldnt be detected by the government screening tests and i wasnt to know anything about it myself pretty crazy right the other two nodded in agreement so i reckon whats so secret that i cant let anybody know i know it not the galactic government not even myself and the answer is i dont know obviously but i put a few things together and i can begin to guess when did i decide to run for president shortly after the death of president yooden vranx you remember yooden ford yeah said ford he was that guy we met when we were kids the arcturan captain he was a gas he gave us conkers when you bust your way into his megafreighter said you were the most amazing kid hed ever met whats all this said trillian ancient history said ford when we were kids together on betelgeuse the arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the galactic centre and the outlying regions the betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and th e arcturans would supply them there was a lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the dordellis wars and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields known to galactic science they were real brute s of ships and huge in orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun one day young zaphod here decides to raid one on a tri ­‐jet scooter designed for stratosphere work a mere kid i mean forget it it was crazier than a mad monkey i went along fo r the ride because id got some very safe money on him not doing it and didnt want him coming back with fake evidence so what happens we got in his tri ­‐ jet which he had souped up into something totally other crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks bust our way into a megafreighter i still dont know how marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers a wilder thing i have not known lost me a years pocket money for what conkers the captain was this really amazing guy yood en vranx said zaphod he gave us food booze ʹ stuff from really weird parts of the galaxy ʹ lots of conkers of course and we had just the most incredible time then he teleported us back into the maximum security wing of betelgeuse state prison he w as a cool guy went on to become president of the galaxy zaphod paused the scene around them was currently plunged into gloom dark mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows the air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition ford said zaphod quietly yeah just before yooden died he came to see me what you never told me no what did he say what did he come to see you about he told me about the heart of gold it was his idea that i should steal it his idea yeah said zaphod and the only possible way of stealing it was to be a t the launching ceremony ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment and then roared with laughter are you telling me he said that you set yourself up to become president of the galaxy just to steal that ship thats it said zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls but why said ford whats so important about having it dunno said zaphod i think if id consciously known what was so important about it and what i would need it for it would have showed up on the brain screening tests and i would never have passed i think yooden told me a lot of things that are still lo cked away so you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result of yooden talking to you he was a hell of a talker yeah but zaphod old mate you want to look after yourself you know zaphod shrugged i mean dont you ha ve any inkling of the reasons for all this asked ford zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his minds no he said at last i dont seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets still he added on further reflection i can understand that i wouldnt trust myself further than i could spit a rat a moment later the last planet in the catalogue vanished from beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again they were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass ­‐top tables and design awards a tall magrathean man was standing in front of them the mice will see you now he said chapter so there you have it said slartibartfast making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalli ng mess of his study he picked up a paper from the top of a pile but then couldnt think of anywhere else to put it so he but it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over deep thought designed the earth we built it and you lived on it and the vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed added arthur not unbitterly yes said the old man pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room ten million years of planning and work gone just like that ten million years earthman can you conceive of that kind of time span a galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in that time gone he paused well thats bureaucracy for you he added you know said arthur thoughtfully all this explains a lot of things all through my life ive had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world something big even sinister and no one would tell me what it was no said the old man thats just perfect ly normal paranoia everyone in the universe has that everyone said arthur well if everyone has that perhaps it means something perhaps somewhere outside the universe we know maybe who cares said slartibartfast before arthur got too excited perhaps im old and tired he continued but i always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied look at me i desig n coastlines i got an award for norway he rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block with his name on it and a model of norway moulded into it wheres the sense in that he said none that ive been able to make out ive been doing fjords in all my life for a fleeting moment they become fashionable and i get a major award he turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly but not so carelessly that it didnt land on something soft in this replacement earth were building theyve given me africa to do and of course im doing it with all fjords again because i happen to like them and im old fashioned enough to t hink that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent and they tell me its not equatorial enough equatorial he gave a hollow laugh what does it matter science has achieved some wonderful things of course but id far rather be happy than right a ny day and are you no thats where it all falls down of course pity said arthur with sympathy it sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed come said slartibartfast you are to meet the mice your arrival on the planet has caused considerable excitement it has already been hailed so i gather as the third most improbable event in the history of the universe what were the first two oh probably just coincidences said slartibartfast carelessly he opened the door and stood waiting for arthur to follow arthur glanced around him once more and then down at himself at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on thursday morning i seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle he muttered to himself i beg your pardon said the old man mildly oh nothing said arthur only joking chapter it is of course well known that careless talk costs lives but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated for instance at the very moment that arthur said i seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space ­‐time cont inuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle the two opposing leaders were meeting for the last tim e a dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the vlhurgs resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts gazed levelly at the ggugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet ­‐smelling steam and with a m illion sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother the creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour and at that very moment the words i seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table unfortunately in the vlhurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries eventually of course after their galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own galaxy ʹ now positively identified as the source of the offending remark for thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came acr oss ʹ which happened to be the earth ʹ where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time but that we are powerless to prevent it its just life they say a short aircar trip brought arthur and th e old magrathean to a doorway they left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of glass ­‐topped tables and perspex awards almost immediately a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room and they entered arthur you re safe a voice cried am i said arthur rather startled oh good the lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see ford trillian and zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes strange sweet meats and bizarre fruits they were stuffing their faces what happened to you demanded arthur well said zaphod attacking a boneful of grilled muscle our hosts here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have n ow given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us here he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from a bowl have some vegan rhinos cutlet its delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing hosts said arthur what hosts i dont see any a small voice said welcome to lunch earth creature arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped ugh he said there are mice on the table there was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at arthur he was busy staring at t wo white mice sitting in what looked like whisky glasses on the table he heard the silence and glanced around at everyone oh he said with sudden realization oh im sorry i wasnt quite prepared for let me introduce you said trillian ar thur this is benji mouse hi said one of the mice his whiskers stroked what must have been a touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky ­‐glass like affair and it moved forward slightly and this is frankie mouse the other mouse said ple ased to meet you and did likewise arthur gaped but arent they yes said trillian they are the mice i brought with me from the earth she looked him in the eye and arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug could you pass me that bowl of grated arcturan megadonkey she said slartibartfast coughed politely er excuse me he said yes thank you slartibartfast said benji mouse sharply you may go what oh er very well said the old man slightly taken aback ill just go and get on with some of my fjords then ah well in fact that wont be necessary said frankie mouse it looks very much as if we wont be needing the new earth any lon ger he swivelled his pink little eyes not now that we have found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed what cried slartibartfast aghast you cant mean that ive got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll o ver africa well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle them said frankie acidly skiing holiday cried the old man those glaciers are works of art elegantly sculptured contours soaring pinnacles of ice deep majestic ravines it would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art thank you slartibartfast said benji firmly that will be all yes sir said the old man coldly thank you very much well goodbye earthman he said to arthur hope the lifestyle comes together with a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked sadly out of the room arthur stared after him not knowing what to say now said benji mouse to business ford and zaphod clinked their glasses together to business they said i beg your pardon said benji ford looked round sorry i thought you were proposing a toast he said the two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports finally they composed themselves and benji moved forward to addr ess arthur now earth creature he said the situation we have in effect is this we have as you know been more or less running your planet for the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called the ultimate question why sa id arthur sharply no ʹ we already thought of that one said frankie interrupting but it doesnt fit the answer why forty ­‐two you see it doesnt work no said arthur i mean why have you been doing it oh i see said frankie well eventually just habit i think to be brutally honest and this is more or less the point ʹ were sick to the teeth with the whole thing and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet ­‐ridden vogons quite frankly gives me the scream ing heeby jeebies you know what i mean it was by the merest lucky chance that benji and i finished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday and have since manipulated our way back to magrathea by the good offices of your friends magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension put in benji since when continued his murine colleague we have had an offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the d chat show and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods and were very much inclined to take it i would wouldnt you ford said zaphod promptingly oh yes said ford jump at it like a shot arthur glanced at them wondering what all this was leading up to but weve got to have a product you see said frankie i mean ideally we still need the ultimate question in some form or other zaphod leaned forward to arthur you see he said if theyre just sitting there in the studio looking very relaxed and you know just mentioning that they happen to know the answer to life the universe and everything and then eventually have to admit that in fact its forty ­‐two then the shows probably quite short no follow ­‐up you see we have to have something that sounds good said benji something that sounds good exclaimed arthur an ultimate question that sounds good from a couple of mice the mice bristled well i mean yes idealism yes the dignity of pure research yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms but there comes a point im afraid where you begin to suspect that if theres any real truth its that the entire multi ­‐dimensional infinity of the universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs and if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten m illion years finding that out and on the other hand just taking the money and running then i for one could do with the exercise said frankie but started arthur hopelessly hey will you get this earthman interrupted zaphod you are a last generation product of that computer matrix right and you were there right up to the moment your planet got the finger yeah er so your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer programme said ford rather lucidly he thought right said zaphod well said arthur doubtfully he wasnt aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything h e had always seen this as one of his problems in other words said benji steering his curious little vehicle right over to arthur theres a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain ʹ so we want to buy it off you what the question said arthur yes said ford and trillian for lots of money said zaphod no no said frankie its the brain we want to buy what i thought you said you could just read his brain electronically prote sted ford oh yes said frankie but wed have to get it out first its got to be prepared treated said benji diced thank you shouted arthur tipping up his chair and backing away from the table in horror it could always be replaced said benji reasonably if you think its important yes an electronic brain said frankie a simple one would suffice a simple one wailed arthur yeah said zaphod with a sudden evil grin youd just have to program it to say what and i dont understand and wheres the tea whod know the difference what cried arthur backing away still further see what i mean said zaphod and howled with pain because of something that trillian did at that moment id notice the difference said arthur no you wouldnt said frankie mouse youd be programmed not to ford made for the door look im sorry mice old lads he said i dont think weve got a deal i rather think we have to have a deal said the mice in chorus all the charm vanishing fro their piping little voices in an instant with a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the table and swung through the air towards arthur who stumbled further backwards into a blind corner utterly unable to cope or think of anything trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him towards the door which ford and zaphod were struggling to open but arthur was dea d weight ʹ he seemed hypnotized by the airborne rodents swooping towards him she screamed at him but he just gaped with one more yank ford and zaphod got the door open on the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only a ssume were the heavy mob of magrathea not only were they ugly themselves but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty they charged so ʹ arthur was about to have his head cut open trillian was unable to help him and ford and zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were all in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din chapter emerge ncy emergency blared the klaxons throughout magrathea hostile ship has landed on planet armed intruders in section a defence stations defence stations the two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass transports where they lay shattered on the floor damnation muttered frankie mouse all that fuss over two pounds of earthling brain he scuttled round and about his pink eyes flashin g his fine white coat bristling with static the only thing we can do now said benji crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought is to try and fake a question invent one that will sound plausible difficult said frankie he thought how a bout whats yellow and dangerous benji considered this for a moment no no good he said doesnt fit the answer they sank into silence for a few seconds alright said benji what do you get if you multiply six by seven no no too lite ral too factual said frankie wouldnt sustain the punters interest again they thought then frankie said heres a thought how many roads must a man walk down ah said benji aha now that does sound promising he rolled the phrase aroun d a little yes he said thats excellent sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all how many roads must a man walk down forty ­‐two excellent excellent thatll fox em frankie baby we are made they performed a scampering dance in their excitement near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards half a mile away four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a way out they emer ged into a wide open ­‐plan computer bay they glanced about wildly which way do you reckon zaphod said ford at a wild guess id say down here said zaphod running off down to the right between a computer bank and the wall as the others started a fter him he was brought up short by a kill ­‐o­‐zap energy bolt that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall a voice on a loud hailer said ok beeblebrox hold it right there weve got you covered cops hissed zaphod and span around in a crouch you want to try a guess at all ford ok this way said ford and the four of them ran down a gangway between two computer banks at the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space ­‐suited f igure waving a vicious kill ­‐o­‐zap gun we dont want to shoot you beeblebrox shouted the figure suits me fine shouted zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units the others swerved in behind him there are two of them said trillian were cornered they squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall they held their breath and waited suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneo usly hey theyre shooting at us said arthur crouching in a tight ball i thought they said they didnt want to do that yeah i thought they said that agreed ford zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment hey he said i thought you said you didnt want to shoot us and ducked again they waited after a moment a voice replied it isnt easy being a cop what did he say whispered ford in astonishment he said it isnt easy being a cop well surely thats his problem isn t it id have thought so ford shouted out hey listen i think weve got enough problems on our own having you shooting at us so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well i think wed all find it easier to cope another pause and then the loud hailer again now see here guy said the voice on the loud hailer youre not dealing with any dumb two ­‐bit trigger ­‐pumping morons with low hairlines little piggy eyes and no conversation were a couple of intelligent caring guys that youd probably quite like if you met us socially i dont go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space ­‐rangers bars like some cops i could mention i go around shooting people gratuitously and then i agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend and i write novels chimed in the other cop though i havent had any of them published yet so i better warn you im in a meeeean mood fords eyes popped halfway out of their sockets who are these guys he said dunno said zaphod i think i preferred it when they were shooting so are you going to come quietly shouted one of the cops again or are you going to let us blast y ou out which would you prefer shouted ford a millisecond later the air about them started to fry again as bolt after bolt of kill ­‐o­‐zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them the fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity when it stopped there were a few seconds of near quietness ad the echoes died away you still there called one of the cops yes they called back we didnt enjoy doing that at all shouted the other cop we could tell shouted ford now listen to this beeblebrox and you better listen good why shouted back zaphod because shouted the cop its going to be very intelligent and quite interesting and humane no w either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our way out here but thats crazy cried trillian you wouldnt do that oh yes we would shouted the cop wouldnt we he asked the other one oh yes wed have to no question the other one called back but why demanded trillian because there are some thin gs you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and everything i just dont believe these guys muttered ford shaking his head one cop shouted to the other shall we shoot them again for a bit yeah why not they let fly another electric barrage the heat and noise was quite fantastic slowly the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate the front had almost all melted away and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back toward s where they were squatting they huddled further back and waited for the end chapter but the end never came at least not then quite suddenly the barrage stopped and the sudden silence afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds the four stared at each other what happened said arthur they stopped said zaphod with a shrug why dunno do y ou want to go and ask them no they waited hello called out ford no answer thats odd perhaps its a trap they havent the wit what were those thuds dunno they waited for a few more seconds right said ford im going to have a look he glanced round at the others is no one going to say no you cant possibly let me go instead they all shook their heads oh well he said and stood up for a moment nothing happened then after a second or so nothing continued to happen ford peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer cautiously he stepped out into the open still nothing happened twenty yards away he could dimly see through th e smoke the space ­‐suited figure of one of the cops he was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground twenty yards in the other direction lay the second man no one else was anywhere to be seen this struck ford as being extremely odd slowly nervously he walked towards the first one the body lay reassuringly still as he approached it and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on the kill ­‐o­‐zap gun that still dangled from its limp fingers he reached down and picked i t up meeting no resistance the cop was quite clearly dead a quick examination revealed him to be from blagulon kappa ʹ he was a methane ­‐breathing life form dependent on his space suit for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of magrathea the tiny life­‐support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have blown up ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment these miniature suit computers usually had the full back ­‐up of the main computer back on the ship with which they were directly linked through the sub ­‐etha such a system was fail ­‐safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction which was unheard of he hurried over to the other prone figure and discovered that exactly the same impossible thing had h appened to him presumably simultaneously he called the others over to look they came shared his astonishment but not his curiosity lets get shot out of this hole said zaphod if whatever im supposed to be looking for is here i dont want it he grabbed the second kill ­‐o­‐zap gun blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor followed by the others he very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away the aircar was em pty but arthur recognized it as belonging to slartibartfast it had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel the note had an arrow drawn on it pointing at one of the controls it said this is probably the best button to press chapter the aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of r through the steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight ghastly grey lights congealed on the land r is a velocity measure defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late it is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances sinc e the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute but also with awareness of the third factor unless handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress ulcers and even death r is not a fixed velocity but it is clearly far too fast the aircar flung itself through the air at r and above deposited them next to the heart of gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence t hey had come presumably on important business of its own shivering the four of them stood and looked at the ship beside it stood another one it was the blagulon kappa policecraft a bulbous sharklike affair slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness the letters informed anyone who cared to read them as to where the ship was from what section of the police it was assigned to and where the power feeds should be connected it seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent even for a ship whose two ­‐man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a smoke ­‐filled chamber several m iles beneath the ground it is one of those curious things that is impossible to explain or define but one can sense when a ship is completely dead ford could sense it and found it most mysterious ʹ a ship and two policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead in his experience the universe simply didnt work like that the other three could sense it too but they could sense the bitter cold even more and hurried back into the heart of gold suffer ing from an acute attack of no curiosity ford stayed and went to examine the blagulon ship as he walked he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust marvin he exclaimed what are you doing dont feel you have to take any notice of me please came a muffled drone but how are you metalman said ford very depressed whats up i dont know said marvin ive never been there why said ford squatting down beside him and shivering are you l ying face down in the dust its a very effective way of being wretched said marvin dont pretend you want to talk to me i know you hate me no i dont yes you do everybody does its part of the shape of the universe i only have to talk t o somebody and they begin to hate me even robots hate me if you just ignore me i expect i shall probably go away he jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction that ship hated me he said dejectedly indicating the policecraft that ship said ford in sudden excitement what happened to it do you know it hated me because i talked to it you talked to it exclaimed ford what do you mean you talked to it simple i got very bored and depressed s o i went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed i talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the universe to it said marvin and what happened pressed ford it committed suicide said marvin and stalked off back to the heart of gold chapter that night as the heart of gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the horsehead nebula zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive pan galactic gargle blasters ford and tril lian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it and arthur took to his bed to flip through fords copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy since he was going to live in the place he reasoned hed better start finding out something about it he came across this entry it said the history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases those of survival inquiry and sophistication otherwise known as the how why and where phases for instance the first phase is characterized by the question how can we eat the second by the question why do we eat and the third by the question where shall we have lunch he got no further before the ships intercom buzzed into life hey ear thman you hungry kid said zaphods voice er well yes a little peckish i suppose said arthur ok baby hold tight said zaphod well take in a quick bite at the restaurant at the end of the universe douglas adams the restaurant at the end of the universe to jane and james with many thanks to geoffrey perkins for achieving the improbable to paddy kingsland lisa braun and alick hale munro for helping him to john lloyd for his help with the original milliways script to simon brett for starting the whole thing off to the paul simon album one trick pony which i played incessantly while writing this book five years is far too long and with very special thanks to jacqui graham for infinite patience kindness and food in adversity there is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be repl aced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable there is another theory which states that this has already happened chapter the story so far in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been wi dely regarded as a bad move many races believe that it was created by some sort of god though the jatravartid people of viltvodle vi believe that the entire universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the great green arkleseizure the jatravartids who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the coming of the great white handkerchief are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol de odorant before the wheel however the great green arkleseizure theory is not widely accepted outside viltvodle vi and so the universe being the puzzling place it is other explanations are constantly being sought for instance a race of hyperintellige nt pan ­‐dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called deep thought to calculate once and for all the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything for seven and a half million years deep thought computed and calculated and in the end announced that the answer was in fact forty ­‐two­‐and so another even bigger computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was and this computer which was called the earth was so large that it was frequen tly mistaken for a planet ʹ especially by the strange ape ­‐ like beings who roamed its surface totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program and this is very odd because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledg e nothing that ever happened on the earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense sadly however just before the critical moment of readout the earth was unexpectedly demolished by the vogons to make way ʹ so they claimed ʹ for a new hyperspace bypass and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever or so it would seem two of there strange ape ­‐like creatures survived arthur dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his ford prefect suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in the vicinity of betelgeuse and not from guildford as he had hitherto claimed and more to the point he knew how to hi tch rides on flying saucers tricia mcmillian ʹ or trillian ʹ had skipped the planet six months earlier with zaphod beeblebrox the then president of the galaxy two survivors they are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted ʹ to fin d the ultimate question and the ultimate answer of life the universe and everything and less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space a vogon ship is moving slowly towards them chapter like all vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed the unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships but in this case that was sad ly impossible uglier things have been spotted in the skies but not by reliable witnesses in fact to see anything much uglier than a vogon ship you would have to go inside and look at a vogon if you are wise however this is precisely what you will av oid doing because the average vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born ʹ or if you are a clearer minded thinker that the vogon had never been born in fact the average vo gon probably wouldnt even think once they are simple ­‐minded thick ­‐willed slug ­‐brained creatures and thinking is not really something they are cut out for anatomical analysis of the vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed misplac ed and dyspeptic liver the fairest thing you can say about them then is that they know what they like and what they like generally involves hurting people and wherever possible getting very angry one thing they dont like is leaving a job unfinishe d ʹ particularly this vogon and particularly ʹ for various reasons ʹ this job this vogon was captain prostetnic vogon jeltz of the galactic hyperspace planning council and he was it who had had the job of demolishing the so ­‐called planet earth he h eaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill ­‐fitting slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship heart of gold was being systematically scanned it mattered little to him that the heart of gold with its infinite improbability drive was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and had he had his way burnt and buried books as well it mattered even less to him that zaphod beeblebrox was aboard zaphod beeblebrox was now the ex ­‐president of the galaxy and though every police force in the galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had stolen the vogon was not interested he had other fish to fry it has been said that vogons are not above a little b ribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds and this was certainly true in his case when he heard the words integrity or moral rectitude he reached for his dictionary and when he heard the chink of ready money in larg e quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away in seeking so implacably the destruction of the earth and all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty there was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built but the matter had been glossed over he grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction computer he croaked get me my brain care specialist on the line within a few seconds the face of gag halfrunt appe ared on the screen smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years away from the vogon face he was looking at mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too though the vogon persistently referred to him as my private brain care spe cialist there was not a lot of brain to take care of and it was in fact halfrunt who was employing the vogon he was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work as one of the galaxys most prominent and successful psychiatrists he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake well he said hello my captain of vogons prostetnic and how are we feeling today the vogon capt ain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise halfrunts smile did not flicker for an instant well he said i think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a vogon you know the natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence that rumbled the vogon is what you always say well again said halfrunt i think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist good we are clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today now tell me what news of the mission we have located the ship wonderful said halfrunt wo nderful and the occupants the earthman is there excellent and a female from the same planet they are the last good good beamed halfrunt who else the man prefect yes and zaphod beeblebrox for an instant halfrunts s mile flickered ah yes he said i had been expecting this it is most regrettable a personal friend inquired the vogon who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out ah no said halfrunt in my profession you know we do not make personal friends ah grunted the vogon professional detachment no said halfrunt cheerfully we just dont have the knack he paused his mouth continued to smile but his e yes frowned slightly but beeblebrox you know he said he is one of my most profitable clients he had personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts he toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it still he said you are ready for your task yes good destroy the ship immediately what about beeblebrox well said halfrunt brightly zaphods just this guy you know he vanished from the screen the vogon captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew attack he said at that precise moment zaphod beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly two hours ago he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the restaurant at the end of the universe whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ships computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the improbability factors with a pencil the heart of golds improbability drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence there was nothing it couldnt do provided you knew exact ly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen he had stolen it when as president he was meant to be launching it he didnt know exactly why he had stolen it except that he liked it he didnt know why he had become pr esident of the galaxy except that it seemed a fun thing to be he did know that there were better reasons than these but that they were buried in a dark locked off section of his two brains he wished the dark locked off section of his two brains woul d go away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life which was to have a wonderfully good time at the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time he had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry starpox he shouted at that same precise moment ford prefect was in mid air this was not because of anything wrong with the ships artificial gravity field but because he was leaping down the stair ­‐well which led to the ships personal cabins it was a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly stumbled recovered raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniatur e service robots flying skidded round the corner burst into zaphods door and explained what was on his mind vogons he said a short while before this arthur dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea it was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the sirius cybernetics corporation it was called a nutri ­‐ matic drinks synthesizer and he had encoun tered it before it claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it when put to the test however it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost but nit quite entirely unlike tea he attempted to reason with the thing tea he said share and enjoy the machine replied and provided him with yet another cup of the sickly liquid he threw it away share and enjoy the machine repeated a nd provided him with another one share and enjoy is the company motto of the hugely successful sirius cybernetics corporation complaints division which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the corporat ion to have shown a consistent profit in recent years the motto stands ʹ or rather stood ʹ in three mile high illuminated letters near the complaints department spaceport on eadrax unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives ʹ now deceased the protruding upper halves of the letters now appear in the local language to read go s tick your head in a pig and are no longer illuminated except at times of special celebration arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid listen you machine he said you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff nutrition and pleasurable sense data burbled the machine share and enjoy it tastes filthy if you have enjoyed the experience of this drink continued the machine why not share it with your friends becaus e said arthur tartly i want to keep them will you try to comprehend what im telling you that drink that drink said the machine sweetly was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure ah said arthur so im a masochist on diet am i share and enjoy oh shut up will that be all arthur decided to give up yes he said then he decided hed be dammed if hed give up no he said look its very very simple all i want is a cup of tea you are going to make one for me keep quiet and listen and he sat he told the nutri ­‐matic about india he told it about china he told it about ceylon he told it about broad leaves drying in the sun he told it about silve r teapots he told it about summer afternoons on the lawn he told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldnt get scalded he even told it briefly about the history of the east india company so thats it is it said the nutri ­‐matic w hen he had finished yes said arthur that is what i want you want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water er yes with milk squirted out of a cow well in a manner of speaking i suppose im going to need some help with this o ne said the machine tersely all the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business well anything i can do said arthur youve done quite enough the nutri ­‐matic informed him it summoned up the ships computer hi t here said the ships computer the nutri ­‐matic explained about tea to the ships computer the computer boggled linked logic circuits with the nutri ­‐matic and together they lapsed into a grim silence arthur watched and waited for a while but nothing further happened he thumped it but still nothing happened eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge in the empty wastes of space the heart of gold hung still around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the galaxy towards it crept the ug ly yellow lump of the vogon ship chapter does anyone have a kettle arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge and instantly began to wonder why trillian was yelling at the computer to talk to her ford was thumping it and zaphod was kicking it and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on th e vision screen he put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to them hello he said at that moment zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble surfaces that contained the instruments that controlled the conventional photon drive they materialized beneath his hands and he flipped over to manual control he pushed he pulled he pressed and he swore the photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again something up said arthur hey didja hear that muttered zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls of the infinite improbability drive the monkey spoke the improbability drive gave two small whines and then also cut out pure history man said zaphod kicking the improbability drive a talking monkey if yo ure upset about something said arthur vogons snapped ford were under attack arthur gibbered well what are you doing lets get out of here cant computers jammed jammed it says all its circuits are occupied theres no power anywhere in the ship ford moved away from the computer terminal wiped a sleeve across his forehead and slumped back against the wall nothing we can do he said he glared at nothing and bit h is lip when arthur had been a boy at school long before the earth had been demolished he had used to play football he had not been at all good at it and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in important matches whenever this happened he used to experience a peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow the image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this mo ment a peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow he started to speak and stopped he started to speak again and stopped again finally he managed to speak er he said he cleared h is throat tell me he continued and said it so nervously that the others all turned to stare at him he glanced at the approaching yellow blob on the vision screen tell me he said again did the computer say what was occupying it i just ask out of interest their eyes were riveted on him and er well thats it really just asking zaphod put out a hand and held arthur by the scruff of the neck wha t have you done to it monkeyman he breathed well said arthur nothing in fact its just that i think a short while ago it was trying to work out how to yes make me some tea thats right guys the computer sang out suddenly just c oping with that problem right now and wow its a biggy be with you in a while it lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at arthur dent as if to relieve the tension the vogons chose that moment to start firing the ship shook the ship thundered outside the inch thick force ­‐ shield around it blistered crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen ­‐megahurt definit ­‐kil photrazon cannon and looked as if it wouldnt be arou nd for long four minutes is how long ford prefect gave itthree minutes and fifty seconds he said a short while later forty ­‐five seconds he added at the appropriate time he flicked idly at some useless switches then gave arthur an unfriendly loo k dying for a cup of tea eh he said three minutes and forty seconds will you stop counting snarled zaphod yes said ford prefect in three minutes and thirty ­‐five seconds aboard the vogon ship prostetnic vogon jeltz was puzzled he had expected a chase he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor beams he had expected to have to use the specially installed sub ­‐ cyclic normality assert ­‐i­‐tron to counter the heart of golds infinite improbability drive but the sub ­‐cyclic normalit y assert ­‐i­‐tron lay idle as the heart of gold just sat there and took it a dozen ­‐megahurt definit ­‐kil photrazon cannon continued to blaze away at the heart of gold and still it just sat there and took it he tested every sensor at his disposal to se e if there was any subtle trickery afoot but no subtle trickery was to be found he didnt know about the tea of course nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the heart of gold were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they had left to spend quite how zaphod beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on obviously the subject of death was in the air but more as something to be avoided than harped upon possibly the horror that zaphod experienced at the prospect of being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the same way about him and whats more be able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming president of the galaxy you want to talk to your great grandfather boggled ford yeah does it have to be now the ship continued to shake and thunder the temperature was rising the light was getting dimmer ʹ all the energy the computer didnt require for thinking abo ut tea was being pumped into the rapidly fading force ­‐field yeah insisted zaphod listen ford i think he may be able to help us are you sure you mean think pick your words with care suggest something else we can do er well ok round the central console now come on trillian monkeyman move they clustered round the central console in confusion sat down and feeling exceptionally foolish held hands with his third hand zaphod turned off the lights darkness gripped t he ship outside the thunderous roar of the definit ­‐kil cannon continued to rip at the force ­‐field concentrate hissed zaphod on his name what is it asked arthur zaphod beeblebrox the fourth what zaphod beeblebrox the fourth conce ntrate the fourth yeah listen im zaphod beeblebrox my father was zaphod beeblebrox the second my grandfather zaphod beeblebrox the third what there was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine now concentrate three mi nutes said ford prefect why said arthur dent are we doing this shut up suggested zaphod beeblebrox trillian said nothing what she thought was there to say the only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner wh ere marvin the paranoid android sat slumped ignoring all and ignored by all in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own round the central console four figures hunched in tight concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying shudder ing of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it they concentrated still they concentrated and still they concentrated the seconds ticked by on zaphods brow stood beads of sweat first of concentration then of frustration and finally of embarrassment at last he let out a cry of anger snatched back his hands from trillian and ford and stabbed at the light switch ah i was beginning to th ink youd never turn the lights on said a voice no not too bright please my eyes arent what they once were four figures jolted upright in their seats slowly they turned their heads to look though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the same place now who disturbs me at this time said the small bent gaunt figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge his two small wispy ­‐haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim memorie s of the birth of the galaxies themselves one lolled in sleep but the other squinted sharply at them if his eyes werent what they once were they must once have been diamond cutters zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment he gave the intricate little double nod which is the traditional betelgeusian gesture of familial respect oh er hi great granddad he breathed the little old figure moved closer towards them he peered through the dim light he thrust out a bony finger at his great grand son ah he snapped zaphod beeblebrox the last of our great line zaphod beeblebrox the nothingth the first the nothingth spat the figure zaphod hated his voice it always seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul he shifted awkwardly in his seat er yeah he muttered er look im really sorry about the flowers i meant to send them along but you know the shop was fresh out of wreaths and you forget snapped za phod beeblebrox the fourth well too busy never think of other people the living are all the same two minutes zaphod whispered ford in an awed whisper zaphod fidgeted nervously yeah but i did mean to send them he said and ill wr ite to my great grandmother as well just as soon as we get out of this your great grandmother mused the gaunt little figure to himself yeah said zaphod er how is she tell you what ill go and see her but first weve just got to your late great grandmother and i are very well rasped zaphod beeblebrox the fourth ah oh but very disappointed in you young zaphod yeah well zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this conversation and fords heavy breath ing at his side told him that the seconds were ticking away fast the noise and the shaking had reached terrifying proportions he saw trillian and arthurs faces white and unblinking in the gloom er great grandfather weve been following your pr ogress with considerable despondency yeah look just at the moment you see not to say contempt could you sort of listen for a moment i mean what exactly are you doing with your life im being attacked by a vogon fleet cried zaphod it was an exaggeration but it was his only opportunity so far of getting the basic point of the exercise across doesnt surprise me in the least said the little old figure with a shrug only its happening right now you see insisted zaphod feverishly the spectral ancestor nodded picked up the cup arthur dent had brought in and looked at it with interest er great granddad did you know interrupting the ghostly figure fixing zapho d with a stern look that betelgeuse five has developed a very slight eccentricy in its orbit zaphod didnt and found the information hard to concentrate on what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on er no look he said me spinning in my grave barked the ancestor he slammed the cup down and pointed a quivering stick ­‐like see ­‐through finger at zaphod your fault he screeched one minute thirty muttered ford his head in his hands yeah look great granddad can you actually help because help exclaimed the old man as if hed been asked for a stoat yeah help and like now because otherwise help repeated the old man as if hed been asked for a lightly grilled stoat in a bun with french fries h e stood amazed you go swanning your way round the galaxy with your the ancestor waved a contemptuous hand with your disreputable friends too busy to put flowers on my grave plastic ones would have done would have been quite appropriate from you but no too busy too modern too sceptical ʹ till you suddenly find yourself in a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally ­‐minded he shook his head ʹ carefully so as not to disturb the slumber of the other one which was already becoming res tive well i dont know young zaphod he continued i think ill have to think about this one one minute ten said ford hollowly zaphod beeblebrox the fourth peered at him curiously why does that man keep talking in numbers he said tho se numbers said zaphod tersely are the time weve got left to live oh said his great grandfather he grunted to himself doesnt apply to me of course he said and moved off to a dimmer recess of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he shouldnt just jump over and have done with it great grandfather he said it applies to us we are still alive and we are about to lose our lives good job too what what use is your life to anyone when i think of what youve made of it the phrase pigs ear comes irresistibly to my mind but i was president of the galaxy man huh muttered his ancestor and what kind of a job is that for a beebleb rox hey what only president you know of the whole galaxy conceited little megapuppy zaphod blinked in bewilderment hey er what are you at man i mean great grandfather the hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee this had the effect of reminding zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didnt feel a thing you know and i know what being president means young zaphod you know because youve been it and i know because im dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective we have a saying up here life is wasted on the living yeah said zaphod bitterly very good very deep right now i need aphorisms like i need holes in my heads fifty seconds grunted ford prefect where was i said zaphod beeblebrox the fourth pontificating said zaphod beeblebrox oh yes can this guy muttered ford quietly to zaphod actually in fa ct help us nobody else can whispered zaphod ford nodded despondently zaphod the ghost was saying you became president of the galaxy for a reason have you forgotten could we go into this later have you forgotten insisted the ghost yeah of course i forgot i had to forget they screen your brain when you get the job you know if theyd found my head full of tricksy ideas id have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat pension secretarial staff a fleet of shi ps and a couple of slit throats ah nodded the ghost in satisfaction then you do remember he paused for a moment good he said and the noise stopped forty ­‐eight seconds said ford he looked again at his watch and tapped it he looked up hey the noise has stopped he said a mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghosts hard little eyes ive slowed down time for a moment he said just for a moment you understand i would hate you to miss all i have to say no you listen to me you see ­‐through old bat said zaphod leaping out of his chair a ʹ thanks for stopping time and all that great terrific wonderful but b ʹ no thanks for the homily right i dont know what this great think im meant to be doing is and it looks to m e as if i was supposed not to know and i resent that right the old me knew the old me cared fine so far so hoopy except that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own brain ʹ my own brain ʹ and locked off the bits that knew and cared because if i knew and cared i wouldnt be able to do it i wouldnt be able to go and be president and i wouldnt be able to steal this ship which must be the important thing but this former self of mine killed himself off didnt he by changi ng my brain ok that was his choice this new me has its own choices to make and by a strange coincidence those choices involve not knowing and not caring about this big number whatever it is thats what he wanted thats what he got except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off well i dont want to know and i dont want to hear them thats my choice im not going to be anybodys puppet particularly not my own zapho d banged the console in fury oblivious to the dumbfolded looks he was attracting the old me is dead he raved killed himself the dead shouldnt hang about trying to interfere with the living and yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape said the ghost ah said zaphod sitting down again well thats different isnt it he grinned at trillian weakly zaphod rasped the apparition i think the only reason i waste my breath on you is that being dead i dont have any other use f or it ok said zaphod why dont you tell me what the big secret is try me zaphod you knew when you were president of the galaxy as did yooden vranx before you that the president is nothing a cipher somewhere in the shadows behind is anothe r man being something with ultimate power that man or being or something you must find ʹ the man who controls this galaxy and ʹ we suspect ʹ others possibly the entire universe why why exclaimed an astonished ghost why look around you lad does it look to you as if its in very good hands its alright the old ghost glowered at him i will not argue with you you will simply take this ship this improbability drive ship to where it is needed you will do it dont think you can escape your purpose the improbability field controls you you are in its grip whats this he was stand ing tapping at one of the terminals of eddie the shipboard computer zaphod told him whats it doing it is trying said zaphod with wonderful restraint to make tea good said his great grandfather i approve of that now zaphod he said t urning and wagging a finger at him i dont know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job i think you will not be able to avoid it however i am too long dead and too tired to care as much as i did the principal reason i am helping you now i s that i couldnt bear the thought of you and your modern friends slouching about up here understood yeah thanks a bundle oh and zaphod er yeah if you ever find you need help again you know if youre in trouble need a hand out of a t ight corner yeah please dont hesitate to get lost within the space of one second a bolt of light flashed from the wizened old ghosts hands to the computer the ghost vanished the bridge filled with billowing smoke and the heart of gold lea pt an unknown distance through the dimensions of time and space chapter ten light years away gag halfrunt jacked up his smile by several notches as he watched the picture on his vision screen relayed across the sub ­‐ether from the bridge of the vogon ship he saw the final shreds of the heart of golds force ­‐shield ripped aw ay and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke good he thought the end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had ordered on the planet earth he thought the final end of this dangerous to the psychiatric profession and subversive al so to the psychiatric profession experiment to find the question to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything he thought there would be some celebration with his fellows tonight and in the morning they would meet again their unhappy bewildered and highly profitable patients secure in the knowledge that the meaning of life would not now be once and for all well and truly sorted out he thought familys always embarrassing isnt it said ford to zaphod as the smoke began to cle ar he paused then looked about wheres zaphod he said arthur and trillian looked about blankly they were pale and shaken and didnt know where zaphod was marvin said ford wheres zaphod a moment later he said wheres marvin the r obots corner was empty the ship was utterly silent it lay in thick black space occasionally it rocked and swayed every instrument was dead every vision screen was dead they consulted the computer it said i regret that i have been temporarily cl osed to all communication meanwhile here is some light music they turned off the light music they searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment and alarm everywhere was dead and silent nowhere was there any trace of zaphod or of mar vin one of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the nutri ­‐matic machine was located on the delivery plate of the nutri ­‐matic drink synthesizer

dollars a day ʹ the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy if you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the guide offices assuming you had landed by now and freshened up with a quick dip and sho wer and then walked east you would pass along the leafy shade of life boulevard be amazed by the pale golden colour of the beaches stretching away to your left astounded by the mind ­‐surfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves as if it was nothing special surprised and eventually slightly irritated by the giant palm trees that hum toneless nothings throughout the daylight hours in other words continuously if you then walked to the end of life boulevard you would enter the lalamatine di strict of shops bolonut trees and pavement cafes where the um ­‐betans come to relax after a hard afternoons relaxation on the beach the lalamatine district is one of those very few areas which doesnt enjoy a perpetual saturday afternoon ʹ it enjoys inst ead the cool of a perpetual early saturday evening behind it lie the night clubs if on this particular day afternoon stretch of eveningtime ʹ call it what you will ʹ you had approached the second pavement cafe on the right you would have seen the usu al crowd of um ­‐betans chatting drinking looking very relaxed and casually glancing at each others watches to see how expensive they were you would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking hitch ­‐hikers from algol who had recently arrived on an arcturan megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few days they were angry and bewildered to discover that here within sight of the hitchhikers guide building itself a simple glass of fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixt y altairan dollars sell out one of them said bitterly if at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one you would have seen zaphod beeblebrox sitting and looking very startled and confused the reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had been sitting on the bridge of the starship heart of gold absolute sell out said the voice again zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two dishevelled hitch ­‐hikers at the next table where the hell was h e how had he got there where was his ship his hand felt the arm of the chair on which he was sitting and then the table in front of him they seemed solid enough he sat very still how can they sit and write a guide for hitch ­‐hikers in a place like this continued the voice i mean look at it look at it zaphod was looking at it nice place he thought but where and why he fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasse s in the same pocket he felt a hard smooth unidentified lump of very heavy metal he pulled it out and looked at it he blinked at it in surprise where had he got that he returned it to his pocket and put on the sunglasses annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched one of the lenses nevertheless he felt much more comfortable with them on they were a double pair of joo janta super ­‐chromatic peril sensitive sunglasses which had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger at the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you apart from the scratch the lenses were clear he relaxed but only a little bit the angry hitch ­‐hiker continued to glare at his monstrously expensive fruit juice worst thing that ever happened to the guide moving to ursa minor beta he grumbled theyve all gone soft you know ive even heard that theyve created a whole electronically synthesized universe in on e of their offices so they can go and research stories during the day and still go to parties in the evening not that day and evening mean much in this place ursa minor beta thought zaphod at least he knew where he was now he assumed that this must be his great grandfathers doing but why much to his annoyance a thought popped into his mind it was very clear and very distinct and he had now come to recognize these thoughts for what they were his instinct was to resist them they were the pre ­‐ordained promptings from the dark and locked off parts of his mind he sat still and ignored the thought furiously it nagged at him he ignored it it nagged at him he ignored it it nagged at him he gave in to it what the hell he thought go with th e flow he was too tired confused and hungry to resist he didnt even know what the thought meant chapter hello yes megadodo publications home of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy the most totally remarkable book in the whole of the known universe can i help you said the large pink ­‐winged insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy offices it fluttered its wings and rolled its eyes it glared at all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer soiling the carpets and leaving dirty handmarks on t he upholstery it adored working for the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy it just wished there was some way of keeping all the hitch ­‐hikers away werent they meant to be hanging round dirty spaceports or something it was certain that it had read somethi ng somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging round dirty spaceports unfortunately most of them seemed to come and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer after hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports and all they ever did was complain it shivered its wings what it said into the phone yes i passed on your message to mr zarniwoop but im afraid hes too cool to see you right now hes on an intergalactic cruise it waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who wa s angrily trying to engage its attention the petulant tentacle directed the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to its left and not to interrupt an important phone call yes said the insect he is in his office but hes on an intergalacti c cruise thank you so much for calling it slammed down the phone read the notice it said to the angry man who was trying to complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of misinformation contained in the book the hitchhikers gui de to the galaxy is an indispensable companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex and confusing universe for though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters it does at least make the reassuring claim that where it is inaccurate it is at least definitely inaccurate in cases of major discrepancy its always reality thats got it wrong this was the gist of the notice it said the guide is definitive reality is frequently inaccurate this has led to some interesting consequences for instance when the editors of the guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet traal literally it said ravenous bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists instead of ravenous bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beau ty was truth truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true the judges concurred and in a moving speech held that life itself was in contempt of court and duly confiscated it fro m all those there present before going off to enjoy a pleasant evenings ultragolf zaphod beeblebrox entered the foyer he strode up to the insect receptionist ok he said wheres zarniwoop get me zarniwoop excuse me sir said the insect ici ly it did not care to be addressed in this manner zarniwoop get him right get him now well sir snapped the fragile little creature if you could be a little cool about it look said zaphod im up to here with cool ok im so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a month i am so hip i have difficulty seeing over my pelvis now will you move before you blow it well if youd let me explain sir said the insect tapping the most petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal im afraid that isnt possible right now as mr zarniwoop is on an intergalactic cruise hell thought zaphod when hes going to be back he said back sir hes in h is office zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out in his mind he didnt succeed this cats on an intergalactic cruise in his office he leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle listen three eyes he said do nt you try to outweird me i get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal well just who do you think you are honey flounced the insect quivering its wings in rage zaphod beeblebrox or something count the heads said zaphod in a low rasp the insect blinked at him it blinked at him again you are zaphod beeblebrox it squeaked yeah said zaphod but dont shout it out or theyll all want one the zaphod beeblebrox no just a zaphod beeblebrox didnt you hear i come in six packs the insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation but sir it squealed i just heard on the sub ­‐ether radio report it said that you were dead yeah thats right said zaphod i just havent stopped moving yet now w here do i find zarniwoop well sir his office is on the fifteenth floor but but hes on an intergalactic cruise yeah yeah how do i get to him the newly installed sirius cybernetics corporation vertical people transporters are in the far corner sir but sir zaphod was turning to go he turned back yeah he said can i ask you why you want to see mr zarniwoop yeah said zaphod who was unclear on this point himself i told myself i had to come again sir zaphod leaned forward conspirationally i just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes he said as a result of an argument with the ghost of my great grandfather no sooner had i got there that my former self the one that operated on my brain popped into my head and said go see zarniwoop i have never heard of the cat that is all i know that and the fact that ive got to find the man who rules the universe he winked mr beeblebrox sir said the insect in awed wonder youre so weird you should be in movies yeah said zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing and you baby should be in real life the insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone a metal hand restrained it excuse me said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition collapse in tears this was not such an insect and it couldnt stand robots yes sir it snapped can i help you i doubt it said marvin well in that case if youll just excuse me six of the phones were now ringing a million things awaited the insects attention no one can help me intoned marvin yes sir well not that anyone tried of course the restraining metal hand fell limply by marvins side his head hung forward very slightly is that so said the insect tartly hardly worth anyones while to help a menial robot is it im sorry sir if i mean wheres the percentage in being kind or help ful to a robot if it doesnt have any gratitude circuits and you dont have any said the insect who didnt seem to be able to drag itself out of this conversation ive never had occasion to find out marvin informed it listen you miserable h eap of maladjusted metal arent you going to ask me what i want the insect paused its long thin tongue darted out and licked its eyes and darted back again is it worth it it asked is anything said marvin immediately what do you want im looking for someone who hissed the insect zaphod beeblebrox said marvin hes over there the insect shook with rage it could hardly speak then why did you ask me it screamed i just wanted something to talk to said marvin what pathetic isnt it with a grinding of gears marvin turned and trundled off he caught up with zaphod approaching the elevators zaphod span round in astonishment hey marvin he said m arvin how did you get here marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him i dont know he said but one moment i was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed and the next moment i was standing here feeling utterly miser able an improbability field i expect yeah said zaphod i expect my great grandfather sent you along to keep me company thanks a bundle grandad he added to himself under his breath so how are you he said aloud oh fine said marvin if you happen to like being me which personally i dont yeah yeah said zaphod as the elevator doors opened hello said the elevator sweetly i am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice i have be en designed by the sirius cybernetics corporation to take you the visitor to the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy into these their offices if you enjoy your ride which will be swift and pleasurable then you may care to experience some of the other ele vators which have recently been installed in the offices of the galactic tax department boobiloo baby foods and the sirian state mental hospital where many ex ­‐sirius cybernetics corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits sympathy a nd happy tales of the outside world yeah said zaphod stepping into it what else do you do besides talk i go up said the elevator or down good said zaphod were going up or down the elevator reminded him yeah ok up please there was a moment of silence downs very nice suggested the elevator hopefully oh yeah super good said zaphod now will you take us up may i ask you inquired the elevator in its sweetest most reasonable voice if youve cons idered all the possibilities that down might offer you zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall he didnt need this he thought to himself this of all things he had no need of he hadnt asked to be here if he was asked at this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him which was his usual reply to this he would probabl y have added something passionate on the subject of food one thing he didnt want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled the universe who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at because if it wasnt him it would only be someone else most of all he didnt want to be standing in an office b lock arguing with an elevator like what other possibilities he asked wearily well the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits theres the basement the microfiles the heating system er it paused nothing particularly exciting it a dmitted but they are alternatives holy zarquon muttered zaphod did i ask for an existentialist elevator he beat his fists against the wall whats the matter with the thing he spat it doesnt want to go up said marvin simply i think its afraid afraid cried zaphod of what heights an elevator thats afraid of heights no said the elevator miserably of the future the future exclaimed zaphod what does the wretched thing want a pension scheme at that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind them from the walls around them came the sound of suddenly active machinery we can all see into the future whispered the elevator in what sounded like terror its part of our programming zaphod looked out of the elevator ʹ an agitated crowd had gathered round the elevator area pointing and shouting every elevator in the building was coming down very fast he ducked back in marvin he said just get this elevator go up will you weve go t to get to zarniwoop why asked marvin dolefully i dont know said zaphod but when i find him hed better have a very good reason for me wanting to see him modern elevators are strange and complex entities the ancient electric winch and maximum ­‐capacity ­‐eight ­‐persons jobs bear as much relation to a sirius cybernetics corporation happy vertical people transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the sirian state mental hospital this is because they operate on t he curios principle of defocused temporal perception in other words they have the capacity to see dimly into the immediate future which enables the elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it thus eliminating al l the tedious chatting relaxing and making friends that people were previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators not unnaturally many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down up and down experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways as a sort of existential protest demanded participation in the decision ­‐making process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking an impoverished hitch ­‐hiker visiting any planets in the sirius star system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators at the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly fifteenth said the elevator and remember im only doing this because i like your robot zaphod and marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would take it zaphod looked around warily the corridor was deserted and silent and gave no clue as to where zarniwoop might be found all the doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked they were standing close to the bridge which led across from one tower of the building to the other through a large window the brilliant sun of ursa minor beta threw blocks of light in which danced small specks of dust a shadow flitted past momentarily left in the lurch by a lift muttered zaphod who was feeling at his least jaunty they both stood and looked in both directions you know something said zaphod to marvin more that you can possibly imagine im dead certain this building shoul dnt be shaking zaphod said it was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet ʹ and another one in the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more vigorously another shadow flitted past zaphod looked at the floor either he said not very co nfidently theyve got some vibro system for toning up your muscles while you work or he walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that moment his joo janta super ­‐chromatic peril sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black a large shadow flitted past the window with a sharp buzz zaphod ripped off his sunglasses and as he did so the building shook with a thunderous roar he leapt to the window or he said this buildings being bombed another roar cracked through t he building who in the galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company asked zaphod but never heard marvins reply because at that moment the building shook with another bomb attack he tried to stagger back to the elevator ʹ a pointless manoeuvre he realized but the only one he could think of suddenly at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from this one he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view a man the man saw him beeblebrox over here he shouted zaphod eyed him wi th distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building no called zaphod beeblebrox over here who are you a friend shouted back the man he ran towards zaphod oh yeah said zaphod anyones friend in particular or just generally well disp osed of people the man raced along the corridor the floor bucking beneath his feet like an excited blanket he was short stocky and weatherbeaten and his clothes looked as if theyd been twice round the galaxy and back with him in them do you know zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived your buildings being bombed the man indicated his awareness it suddenly stopped being light glancing round at the window to see why zaphod gaped as a huge sluglike gunmetal ­‐green spacecraft crept throu gh the air past the building two more followed it the government you deserted is out to get you zaphod hissed the man theyve sent a squadron of frogstar fighters frogstar fighters muttered zaphod zarquon you get the picture what a re frogstar fighters zaphod was sure hed heard someone talk about them when he was president but he never paid much attention to official matters the man was pulling him back through a door he went with him with a searing whine a small black spider ­‐like object shot through the air and disappeared down the corridor what was that hissed zaphod frogstar scout robot class a out looking for you said the man hey yeah get down from the opposite direction came a larger black spider ­‐like object it zapped past them and that was a frogstar scout robot class b out looking for you and that said zaphod as a third one seared through the air a frogstar scout robot class c out looking for you hey chuckled zaphod to himself pretty stupid robots eh from over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum a gigantic black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower the size and shape of a tank holy photon whats that a tank said the man frogstar scout robot class d come to get you should we leave i think we should marvin called zaphod what do you want marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and looked at them you see that robot coming towards us marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards them over the bridge he looked down at his own small metal body he looked back up at the tank i suppose you want me to stop it he said yeah whilst you save your skins yeah said zaphod get in there just so long said marvin as i know where i stand the man tugged at zaphods arm and zaphod fol lowed him off down the corridor a point occurred to him about this where are we going he said zarniwoops office is this any time to keep an appointment come on chapter marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor he was not in fact a particularly small robot his silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing he did however look pitifully smal l as the gigantic black tank rolled to a halt in front of him the tank examined him with a probe the probe withdrew marvin stood there out of my way little robot growled the tank im afraid said marvin that ive been left here to stop you the probe extended again for a quick recheck it withdrew again you stop me roared the tank go on no really i have said marvin simply what are you armed with roared the tank in disbelief guess said marvin the tanks engines rum bled its gears ground molecule ­‐sized electronic relays deep in its micro ­‐brain flipped backwards and forwards in consternation guess said the tank zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor down a second and along a third the bui lding continued to rock and judder and this puzzled zaphod if they wanted to blow the building up why was it taking so long with difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous unmarked doors and heaved at it with a sudden jolt it opened and they fell inside all this way thought zaphod all this trouble all this not ­‐lying ­‐on­‐ the­‐beach ­‐having ­‐a­‐wonderful ­‐time and for what a single chair a single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office the desk apart from a bit of d ancing dust and single revolutionary form of paper clip was empty where said zaphod is zarniwoop feeling that his already tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip hes on an intergalactic cruise said the man zaphod tried to size the man up earnest type he thought not a barrel of laughs he probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to running up and down heaving corridors breaking down doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices let me introduce myself the man said my name is roosta and this is my towel hello roosta said zaphod hello towel he added as roosta held out to him a rather nasty old flowery towel not knowing what to do with it he shook it by the corner outside the window one of the huge slug ­‐like gunmetal ­‐green spaceships growled past yes go on said mar vin to the huge battle machine youll never guess errmmm said the machine vibrating with unaccustomed thought laser beams marvin shook his head solemnly no muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble too obvious anti ­‐matter ray it hazarded far too obvious admonished marvin yes grumbled the machine somewhat abashed er how about an electron ram this was new to marvin whats that he said one of these said the machine with enthusiasm from its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal blaze of light behind marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a heap of dust the dust billowed briefly then settled no said marvin not one of those good though isnt it very good agreed ma rvin i know said the frogstar battle machine after another moments consideration you must have one of those new xanthic re ­‐structron destabilized zenon emitters nice arent they said marvin thats what youve got said the machine in co nsiderable awe no said marvin oh said the machine disappointed then it must be youre thinking along the wrong lines said marvin youre failing to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship between men and robots er i know said the battle machine is it it tailed off into thought again just think urged marvin they left me an ordinary menial robot to stop you a gigantic heavy ­‐duty battle machine whilst they ran off to save themselves what do y ou think they would leave me with oooh er muttered the machine in alarm something pretty damn devastating i should expect expect said marvin oh yes expect ill tell you what they gave me to protect myself with shall i yes alright said the battle machine bracing itself nothing said marvin there was a dangerous pause nothing roared the battle machine nothing at all intoned marvin dismally not an electronic sausage the machine heaved about with f ury well doesnt that just take the biscuit it roared nothing eh just dont think do they and me said marvin in a soft low voice with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side makes you spit doesnt it yes agreed marvin with feeling hell that makes me angry bellowed the machine think ill smash that wall down the electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and took out the wall next to the machine how do you think i feel said marvin bitte rly just ran off and left you did they the machine thundered yes said marvin i think ill shoot down their bloody ceiling as well raged the tank it took out the ceiling of the bridge thats very impressive murmured marvin you ain t seeing nothing yet promised the machine i can take out this floor too no trouble it took out the floor too hells bells the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below what a depressingly stupid machine said marvin and trudged away chapter so do we just sit here or what said zaphod angrily what do these guys out here want you beeblebrox said roosta theyre going to take you to the frogstar ʹ the most totally evil world in the galaxy oh yeah said zaphod theyll have to come and get me first they have come and got you said roosta look out of the window zaphod looked and gaped the grounds going away he gasped where ar e they taking the ground theyre taking the building said roosta were airborne clouds streaked past the office window out in the open air again zaphod could see the ring of dark green frogstar fighters round the uprooted tower of the building a network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower in a firm grip zaphod shook his head in perplexity what have i done to deserve this he said i walk into a building they take it away its not what youve done theyre worried about said roosta its what youre going to do well dont i get a say in that you did years ago youd better hold on were in for a fast and bumpy journey if i ever meet myself said zaphod ill hit myself so hard i wont know whats hit me marvin trudged in through the door looked at zaphod accusingly slumped in a corner and switched himself off on the bridge of the heart of gold all was silent arthur stared at the rack in front of him and thought he caught trillians eyes as she looked at him inquiringly he looked back at the rack finally he saw it he picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board that lay just in front of the rack the five squares had on them the five letters e x q u and i he laid them next to the letters s i t e exquisite he said on a triple word score scores rather a lot im afraid the ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the nth time trillian sighed and started to sort them out again up and do wn the silent corridors echoed ford prefects feet as he stalked the ship thumping dead instruments why did the ship keep shaking he thought why did it rock and sway why could he not find out where they were where basically were they the left ­‐hand tower of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the universe in a room halfway up it zaphod beeblebrox strode angrily roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel maintenance hey where did you say this building was flying to demanded zaphod the frogstar said roosta the most totally evil place in the universe do they have food there said zaphod food youre going to the frogstar and youre worried about whether they got food without food i may not make it to the frogstar out of the window they could see nothing but the flickering light of the forc e beams and vague green streaks which were presumably the distorted shapes of the frogstar fighters at this speed space itself was invisible and indeed unreal here suck this said roosta offering zaphod his towel zaphod stared at him as if he e xpected a cuckoo to leap out of his forehead on a small spring its soaked in nutrients explained roosta what are you a messy eater or something said zaphod the yellow stripes are high in protein the green ones have vitamin b and c complexes the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm extracts zaphod took and looked at it in amazement what are the brown stains he asked bar­‐b­‐q sauce said roosta for when i get sick of wheatgerm zaphod sniffed it doubtfully even more doubtful ly he sucked a corner he spat it out again ugh he stated yes said roosta when ive had to suck that end i usually need to suck the other end a bit too why asked zaphod suspiciously whats in that anti ­‐depressants said roosta ive gone right off this towel you know said zaphod handing it back roosta took it back from him swung himself off the desk walked round it sat in the chair and put his feet up beeblebrox he said sticking his hands behind his head have you any idea whats going to happen to you on the frogstar theyre going to feed me hazarded zaphod hopefully theyre going to feed you said roosta into the total perspective vortex zaphod had never heard of this he believed that he had heard of all the fun things in the galaxy so he assumed that the total perspective vortex was not fun he asked what it was only said roosta the most savage psychic torture a sentinent being can undergo zaphod nodded a resigned nod so he said no food huh listen said roosta urgently you can kill a man destroy his body break his spirit but only the total perspective vortex can annihilate a mans soul the treatment lasts seconds but the effect lasts the rest of your life you ever had a pan galactic gargle blaster asked zaphod sharply this is worse phreeow admitted zaphod much impressed any idea why these guys might want to do this to me he added a moment later they believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever they know what youre after could they drop me a note and let me know as well you know said roosta you know beeblebrox you want to meet the man who rules the universe can he cook said zaphod on reflection he added i do ubt if he can if he could cook a good meal he wouldnt worry about the rest of the universe i want to meet a cook roosta sighed heavily what are you doing here anyway demanded zaphod whats all this got to so with you im just one of those who planned this thing along with zarniwoop along with yooden vranx along with your great grandfather along with you beeblebrox me yes you i was told you had changed i didnt realize how much but i am here to do one job i will do it before i leave you what job man what are you talking about i will do it before i leave you roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence zaphod was terribly glad chapter the air around the second planet of the frogstar system was stale and unwholesome the dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over salt flats dried up marshland tangled and rotting vegetation and the crumbling remains of ruined cities no life moved across its surface the ground like that of many planets in this part of the galaxy had long been deserted the howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old decaying houses of the cities it was more desolate as it wh ipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the surface of this world at the top of these towers lived colonies of large scraggy evil smelling birds the sole survivors of the civilization that once lived h ere the howl of the wind was at its most desolate however when it passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities this pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the galaxy from without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across from within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend about a hundred yards or so away and sep arated from it by a pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of sorts that is to say that scattered over a largish area were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen cr ash­‐landed buildings flitting over and around these buildings was a mind a mind that was waiting for something the mind directed its attention into the air and before very long a distant speck appeared surrounded by a ring of smaller specks the la rger speck was the left ­‐hand tower of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy office building descending through the stratosphere of frogstar world b as it descended roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable silence that had grown up between the two me n he stood up and gathered his towel into a bag he said beeblebrox i will now do the job i was sent here to do zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner sharing unspoken thoughts with marvin yeah he said the building w ill shortly be landing when you leave the building do not go out of the door said roosta go out of the window good luck he added and walked out of the door disappearing from zaphods life as mysteriously as he had entered it zaphod leapt up and tried the door but roosta had already locked it he shrugged and returned to the corner two minutes later the building crashlanded amongst the other wreckage its escort of frogstar fighters deactivated their force beams and soared off into the ai r again bound for frogstar world a an altogether more congenial spot they never landed on frogstar world b no one did no one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the total perspective vortex zaphod was badly shaken by the cr ash he lay for a while in the silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced he felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life he felt bewildered he felt lonely he felt unloved eventually he felt he ought to get wh atever it was over with he looked around the cracked and broken room the wall had split round the door frame and the door hung open the window by some miracle was closed and unbroken for a while he hesitated then he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him then there must be a good reason for it with marvins help he got the window open outside it the cloud of dust aroused by the crash and the hulks of t he other buildings with which this one was surrounded effectively prevented zaphod from seeing anything of the world outside not that this concerned him unduly his main concern was what he saw when he looked down zarniwoops office was on the fifteent h floor the building had landed at a tilt of about forty ­‐five degrees but still the descent looked heart ­‐stopping eventually stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks that marvin appeared to be giving him he took a deep breath and clambere d out on to the steeply inclined side of the building marvin followed him and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground as he crawled the dank air and dust choked his lungs his eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin the occasional remark from marvin of the order of this is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it i ask merely for information did little to improve his state of mind about half ­‐way down the side of the shattered building they stopped to rest it seemed to zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual eventually he realized this wasnt so the robot just seem ed cheerful in comparison with his own mood a large scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly settling clouds of dust and stretching down its scrawny legs landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from zaphod it folded its ungain ly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch its wingspan must have been something like six feet and its head and neck seemed curiously large for a bird its face was flat the beak underdeveloped and half ­‐way along the underside of its wings the vesti ges of something handlike could be clearly seen in fact it looked almost human it turned its heavy eyes on zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion go away said zaphod ok muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust again zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment did that bird just talk to me he asked marvin nervously he was quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation that he was in fact hallucinating yes confirmed marvin poor souls said a deep ethereal voice in zaphods ear twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly caused zaphod to fall off the building he grabbed savagely at a protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it he hung on breathing heavily the v oice had no visible source whatever ʹ there was no one there nevertheless it spoke again a tragic history behind them you know a terrible blight zaphod looked wildly about the voice was deep and quiet in other circumstances it would even be described as soothing there is however nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere particularly if you are like zaphod b eeblebrox not at your best and hanging from a ledge eight storeys up a crashed building hey er he stammered shall i tell you their story inquired the voice quietly hey who are you panted zaphod where are you later then perhaps murmured the voice i am gargravarr i am the custodian of the total perspective vortex why cant i see you will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated the voice lifted if you move about two yards to your left why dont you try it zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the way down the side of the building gratefully he shifted himself across to them why dont i see you again at the bottom said the voice in his ear and as it spoke i t faded hey called out zaphod where are you itll only take a couple of minutes said the voice very faintly marvin said zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to him did a did a voice just yes marvin repl ied tersely zaphod nodded he took out his peril sensitive sunglasses again they were completely black and by now quite badly scratched by the unexpected metal object in his pocket he put them on he would find his way down the building more comfortab ly if he didnt actually have to look at what he was doing minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled foundations of the building and once more removing his sunglasses he dropped to the ground marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the dust and rubble from which position he seemed too disinclined to move ah there you are said the voice suddenly in zaphods ear excuse me leaving you like that its just that i have a terrible head for heights at least it added wistfully i did have a terrible head for heights zaphod looked around slowly and carefully just to see if he had missed something which might be the source of the voice all he saw however was the dus t the rubble and the towering hulks of the encircling buildings hey er why cant i see you he said why arent you here i am here said the voice slowly my body wanted to come but its a bit busy at the moment things to do people to see after what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added you know how it is with bodies zaphod wasnt sure about this i thought i did he said i only hope its gone for a rest cure continued the voice the way its been living recently it mu st be on its last elbows elbows said zaphod dont you mean last legs the voice said nothing for a while zaphod looked around uneasily he didnt know if it was gone or was still there or what it was doing then the voice spoke again so you are to be put into the vortex yes er well said zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance this cats in no hurry you know i can just slouch about and take in a look at the local scenery you know have you seen the local scenery asked the voice of gargravarr er no zaphod clambered over the rubble and rounded the corner of one of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view he looked out at the landscape of frogstar world b ah ok he said ill just sort of slouch ab out then no said gargravarr the vortex is ready for you now you must come follow me er yeah said zaphod and how am i meant to do that ill hum for you said gargravarr follow the humming a soft keening sound drifted through the air a pale sad sound that seemed to be without any kind of focus it was only by listening very carefully that zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it was coming slowly dazedly he stumbled off in its wake what else was there to do chapter the universe as has been observed before is an unsettlingly big place a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own devising and this is what most beings in fact do for instance in one corner of the eastern galactic arm lies the large forest planet oglaroon the entire intelligent population of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut tree in which tree they are born live fall in love carve tiny speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life the futility of death and the importance of birth control fight a few extreme ly minor wars and eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less accessible outer branches in fact the only oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the oth er trees might be capable of supporting life at all or indeed whether the other trees are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many oglanuts exotic though this behaviour may seem there is no life form in the galaxy which is not in som e way guilty of the same thing which is why the total perspective vortex is as horrific as it is for when you are put into the vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation and somewhere in it a tiny li ttle marker a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot which says you are here the grey plain stretched before zaphod a ruined shattered plain the wind whipped wildly over it visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome this gathered za phod was where he was going this was the total perspective vortex as he stood and gazed bleakly at it a sudden inhuman wail of terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from his body it screamed above the wind and died away zaphod s tarted with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium hey what was that he muttered voicelessly a recording said gargravarr of the last man who was put in the vortex it is always played to the next victim a sort of prelude hey it really sounds bad stammered zaphod couldnt we maybe slope off to a party or something for a while think it over for all i know said gargravarrs ethereal voice im probably at one my body that is it goes to a lot of parties without me says i only get in the way hey ho what is all this with your body said zaphod anxious to delay whatever it was that was going to happen to him well its its busy you know said gargravarr hesitantly you mean its got a mind of its own said zaphod there was a long and slightly chilly pause before gargravarr spoke again i have to say he replied eventually that i find that remark in rather poor taste zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology no matter said gar gravarr you werent to know the voice fluttered unhappily the truth is it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very hard to keep it under control the truth is that we are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation i su spect it will end in divorce the voice was still again leaving zaphod with no idea of what to say he mumbled uncertainly i think we are probably not very well suited said gargravarr again at length we never seemed to be happy doing the same thi ngs we always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing eventually we tried to combine the two but that only led to disaster as you can probably imagine and now my body refuses to let me in it wont even see me he paused again tragically the wind whipped across the plain it says i only inhibit it i pointed out that in fact i was meant to inhibit it and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec remark that got right up a bodys left nostril and so we left it it will probably get custody of my forename oh said zaphod faintly and whats that pizpot said the voice my name is pizpot gargravarr says it all really doesnt it errr said zaphod sympathetically and that is why i as a disembodied mind have this job custodian of the total perspective vortex no one will ever walk on the ground of this planet except the victims of the vortex ʹ they dont really count im afraid ah ill tell you the story would you like to hear it er many years ago this was a thriving happy planet ʹ people cities shops a normal world except that on the high streets of these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought necessary and slowly insidiously the numbers of these shoe shops were increasing its a well known economic phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation for the more shoe shops there were the more shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable they became and the worse they were to wear the more people had to buy to keep themse lves shod and the more the shops proliferated until the whole economy of the place passed what i believe is termed the shoe event horizon and it became no longer economically possible to build anything other than shoe shops result ʹ collapse ruin and famine most of the population died out those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds ʹ youve seen one of them ʹ who cursed their feet cursed the ground and vowed that none should walk on it again unhappy lot come i must take you to the vortex zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the plain and you he said you come from this hellhole pit do you no no said gargravarr taken aback i come from the frogstar world c beautiful place wonderful fishing i flit back there in the evenings though all i can do now is watch the total perspective vortex is the only thing on this planet with any functi on it was built here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep at that moment another dismal scream rent the air and zaphod shuddered what can do that to a guy he breathed the universe said gargravarr simply the whole infinite univers e the infinite suns the infinite distances between them and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot infinitely small hey im zaphod beeblebrox man you know muttered zaphod trying to flap the last remnants of his ego gargravarr made no reply but merely resumed his mournful humming till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain as they reached it a door hummed open in the side revealing a small darkened chamber within enter said gargravarr zaphod started with fear hey what now he said now zaphod peered nervously inside the chamber was very small it was steel ­‐lined and there was hardly space in it for more than one man it er it doesnt look like any kind of vortex to me said zapho d it isnt said gargravarr its just the elevator enter with infinite trepidation zaphod stepped into it he was aware of gargravarr being in the elevator with him though the disembodied man was not for the moment speaking the elevator began its descent i must get myself into the right frame of mind for this muttered zaphod there is no right frame of mind said gargravarr sternly you really know how to make a guy feel inadequate i dont the vortex does at the bottom of the shaft the rear of the elevator opened up and zaphod stumbled out into a smallish functional steel ­‐lined chamber at the far side of it stood a single upright steel box just large enough for a man to stand in it was that simple it connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a single thick wire is that it said zaphod in surprise that is it didnt look too bad thought zaphod and i get in there do i said zaphod you get in there said gargravarr and im afraid you must do it now ok ok said zaphod he opened the door of the box and stepped in inside the box he waited after five seconds there was a click and the entire universe was there in the box with him chapter the total perspective vortex derives its picture of the whole universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses to explain ʹ since every piece of matter in the universe is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the universe it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation ʹ every sun every planet their orbits their composition and their economic and social history from say one small piece of fairy cake the man who invented the total perspective vortex did so ba sically in order to annoy his wife trin tragula ʹ for that was his name ʹ was a dreamer a thinker a speculative philosopher or as his wife would have it an idiot and she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake have some sense of proportion she would say sometimes as often as thirty ­‐eight times in a single day and so he built the total perspective vortex ʹ just to show her and into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake and into the other end he plugged his wife so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it to trin tragulas horror the shock completely annihilated her brain but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a universe of this size then the one thi ng it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion the door of the vortex swung open from his disembodied mind gargravarr watched dejectedly he had rather liked zaphod beeblebrox in a strange sort of way he was clearly a man of many qualities eve n if they were mostly bad ones he waited for him to flop forwards out of the box as they all did instead he stepped out hi he said beeblebrox gasped gargravarrs mind in amazement could i have a drink please said zaphod you you have been in the vortex stammered gargravarr you saw me kid and it was working sure was and you saw the whole infinity of creation sure really neat place you know that gargravarrs mind was reeling in astonishment had his bo dy been with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging open and you saw yourself said gargravarr in relation to it all oh yeah yeah but what did you experience zaphod shrugged smugly it just told me what i knew all the time im a really terrific and great guy didnt i tell you baby im zaphod beeblebrox his gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and suddenly stopped startled he breathed heavily hey he said is that really a piece of fairy cake he ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with which it was surrounded if i told you how much i needed this he said ravenously i wouldnt have time to eat it he ate it chapter a short while later he was running across the plain in the direction of the ruined city the dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling night was beginning to fall too and the rough ground w as treacherous the elation of his recent experience was still with him though the whole universe he had seen the whole universe stretching to infinity around him ʹ everything and with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it having a conceited ego is one thing actually being told by a machine is another he didnt have time to reflect on this matter gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what had happened but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing so enough time for zaphod to make a break and find somewhere to hide what he was going to do he didnt know but feeling that he was the most important person in the universe gave him the confidence to believe that something would turn up nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for optimism he ran on and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city he walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny weeds the holes filled with rotting shoes the buildings he passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of them where could he hide he hurried on after a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the one down which he was walking and at its end lay a vast low building surrounded with sundry smaller ones the whole surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier the large main building still seemed reasonably solid and zaphod turned off to see if it might provide him with well with anything he approached the building along one side of it ʹ the front it would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area ʹ were three gigantic doors maybe sixty feet high the far one of these was open and towards this zaphod ran inside all was gloom dust and confusion giant cobwebs lay over everything part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed part of the rear wall had caved in and a thick choking dust lay inches over the floor through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed covered with debris the shapes were sometimes cylindrical sometimes bulbous sometimes like eggs or rather cracked eggs most of them were sp lit open or falling apart some were mere skeletons they were all spacecraft all derelict zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks there was nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable even the mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to collapse further into itself towards the rear of the building lay one old ship slightly larger than the others and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs its outline however seemed unbroken zaphod approached it with interest and as he did so he tripped over an old feedline he tried to toss the feedline aside and to his surprise discovered that it was still connected to the ship to his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also humming sligh tly he stared at the ship in disbelief and then back down at the feedline in his hands he tore off his jacket and threw it aside crawling along on his hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it connected with the ship the connect ion was sound and the slight humming vibration was more distinct his heart was beating fast he wiped away some grime and laid an ear against the ships side he could only hear a faint indeterminate noise he rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all about him and found a short length of tubing and a non ­‐ biodegradable plastic cup out of this he fashioned a crude stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship what he heard made his brains turn somersaults the voice said transtellar cruise lines would like to apologize to passengers for the continuing delay to this flight we are currently awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemon ­‐soaked paper napkins for your co mfort refreshment and hygiene during the journey meanwhile we thank you for your patience the cabin crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again zaphod staggered backwards staring wildly at the ship he walked around for a few moments in a daze in so doing he suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging but by only one support from the ceiling above him it was covered with grime but some of the figures were still discernible zaphods eyes searched amongst the figur es then made some brief calculations his eyes widened nine hundred years he breathed to himself that was how late the ship was two minutes later he was on board as he stepped out of the airlock the air that greeted him was cool and fresh ʹ the air conditioning was still working the lights were still on he moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow corridor and stepped nervously down it suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him please return to y our seat sir said the android stewardess and turning her back on him she walked on down the corridor in front of him when his heart had started beating again he followed her she opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through he foll owed her through the door they were now in the passenger compartment and zaphods heart stopped still again for a moment in every seat sat a passenger strapped into his or her seat the passengers hair was long and unkempt their fingernails were long the men wore beards all of them were quite clearly alive ʹ but sleeping zaphod had the creeping horrors he walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream by the time he was half­‐way down the aisle the stewardess had reached the other end she turned and spoke good afternoon ladies and gentlemen she said sweetly thank you for bearing with us during this slight delay we will be taking off as soon as we possibly can if you would like to wake up now i will serve you coffee and biscuits there was a slight hum at that moment all the passengers awoke they awoke screaming and clawing at their straps an d life support systems that held them tightly in their seats they screamed and bawled and hollered till zaphod thought his ears would shatter they struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a p acket of biscuits in front of each one of them then one of them rose from his seat he turned and looked at zaphod zaphods skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get off he turned and ran from the bedlam he plunged through the door and back into the corridor the man pursued him he raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor through the entrance chamber and beyond he arrived on the flight deck slammed and bolted the door behind him he leant back ag ainst the door breathing hard within seconds a hand started beating on the door from somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him passengers are not allowed on the flight deck please return to your seat and wait for the ship to tak e off coffee and biscuits are being served this is your autopilot speaking please return to your seat zaphod said nothing he breathed hard behind him the hand continued to knock on the door please return to your seat repeated the autopilot passengers are not allowed on the flight deck im not a passenger panted zaphod please return to your seat i am not a passenger shouted zaphod again please return to your seat i am not a hello can you hear me please return to your seat youre the autopilot said zaphod yes said the voice from the flight console youre in charge of this ship yes said the voice again there has been a delay passengers are to be kept temporarily in suspended animation for thei r comfort and convenience coffee and biscuits are being served every year after which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their continued comfort and convenience departure will take place when the flight stores are complete we apologize for the delay zaphod moved away from the door on which the pounding had now ceased he approached the flight console delay he cried have you seen the world outside this ship its a wasteland a desert civilizations been and gone man there a re no lemon ­‐soaked paper napkins on the way from anywhere the statistical likelihood continued the autopilot primly is that other civilizations will arise there will one day be lemon ­‐soaked paper napkins till then there will be a short delay ple ase return to your seat but but at that moment the door opened zaphod span round to see the man who had pursued him standing there he carried a large briefcase he was smartly dressed and his hair was short he had no beard and no long fingerna ils zaphod beeblebrox he said my name is zarniwoop i believe you wanted to see me zaphod beeblebrox wittered his mouths said foolish things he dropped into a chair oh man oh man where did you spring from he said ive been waiting her e for you he said in a businesslike tone he put the briefcase down and sat in another chair i am glad you followed instructions he said i was a bit nervous that you might have left my office by the door rather than the window then you would have been in trouble zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled when you entered the door of my office you entered my electronically synthesized universe he explained if you had left by the door you would have been back in the real one the artificial one works from here he patted the briefcase smugly zaphod glared at him with resentment an d loathing whats the difference he muttered nothing said zarniwoop they are identical oh ʹ except that i think the frogstar fighters are grey in the real universe whats going on spat zaphod simple said zarniwoop his self assurance and smugness made zaphod seethe very simple repeated zarniwoop i discovered the coordinated at which this man could be found ʹ the man who rules the universe and discovered that his world was protected b y an unprobability field to protect my secret ʹ and myself ʹ i retreated to the safety of this totally artificial universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner i was secure meanwhile you and i you and i said zaphod angrily you mean i knew you yes said zarniwoop we knew each other well i had no taste said zaphod and resumed a sullen silence meanwhile you and i arranged that you would steal the improbability drive ship ʹ the only one which could reach the rulers world ʹ and bring it to me here this you have now done i trust and i congratulate you he smiled a tight little smile which zaphod wanted to hit with a brick oh and in case you were wondering added zarniwoop this universe was created specifically f or you to come to you are therefore the most important person in this universe you would never he said with an even more brickable smile have survived the total perspective vortex in the real one shall we go where said zaphod sullenly he felt collapsed to your ship the heart of gold you did bring it i trust no where is your jacket zaphod looked at him in mystification my jacket i took it off its outside good we will go and find it zarniwoop stood up and gestured t o zaphod to follow him out in the entrance chamber again they could hear the screams of the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits it has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you said zarniwoop not pleasant for you bawled zaphod how do you think zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open a few feet away from them they could see zaphods jacket lying in the debris a very remarkable and very powerful ship said zarniwoop watch as they watched the poc ket on the jacket suddenly bulged it split it ripped the small metal model of the heart of gold that zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing it grew it continued to grow it reached after two minutes its full size at an improbability level said zarniwoop of oh i dont know but something very large zaphod swayed you mean i had it with me all the time zarniwoop smiled he lifted up his briefcase and opened it he twisted a single switch inside it goodbye artificial universe he said hello real one the scene before them shimmered briefly ʹ and reappeared exactly as before you see said zarniwoop exactly the same you mean repeated zaphod tautly that i had it with me all the time oh yes said zarniwoop of course that was the whole point thats it said zaphod you can count me out from hereon in you can count me out ive had all i want of this you play your own games im afraid you cannot leave said zarniwoo p you are entwined in the improbability field you cannot escape he smiled the smile that zaphod had wanted to hit and this time zaphod hit it chapter ford prefect bounded up to the bridge of the heart of gold trillian arthur he shouted its working the ships reactivated trillian and arthur were asleep on the floor come on you guys were going off were off he said kicking them awake hi there guys twittered the computer its really great to be back with you again i can tell you and i just want to say that shut up said ford tell us where the hell we are frogstar world b and man its a dump said zaphod running on to the bridge hi guys you must be so amazingly glad to see me you dont even find words to tell me what a cool frood i am what a what said arthur blearily picking himself up from the floor and not taking any of this in i know how you feel said zaphod im so great even i get tongue ­‐tied talking to myself hey its good to see you trillian ford monkeyman hey er computer hi there mr beeblebrox sir sure is a great honor to shut up and get us out of here fast fast fast sure thing fella where do you want to go anywhere doesnt matter shouted zaphod yes it does he said again we want to go to the nearest place to eat sure thing said the computer happily and a massive explosion rocket the bridge when zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye he regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest chapter four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness consciousness had died cold oblivion pulled the bodies d own and down into the pit of unbeing the roar of silence echoed dismally around them and they sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red that slowly engulfed them seemingly for ever after what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left the m lying on a cold hard shore the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of life the universe and everything cold spasms shook them lights danced sickeningly around them the cold hard shore tipped and span and then stood still it shone darkly ʹ it was a v ery highly polished cold hard shore a green blur watched them disapprovingly it coughed good evening madam gentlemen it said do you have a reservation ford prefects consciousness snapped back like elastic making his brain smart he looked up woozily at the green blur reservation he said weakly yes sir said the green blur do you need a reservation for the afterlife in so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows disdainfully this is what the green blur no w did afterlife sir it said arthur dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath is this the afterlife he stammered well i assume so said ford prefect trying to work out which way was u p he tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite direction from the cold hard shore on which he was lying and staggered to what he hoped were his feet i mean he said swaying gently theres no way we could have survived that blast is there no muttered arthur he had raised himself on to his elbows but it didnt seem to improve things he slumped down again no said trillian standing up no way at all a dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor it was zaphod beeblebrox attempting to speak i certainly didnt survive he gurgled i was a total goner wham bang and that was it yeah thanks t o you said ford we didnt stand a chance we must have been blown to bits arms legs everywhere yeah said zaphod struggling noisily to his feet if the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks said the green blur hovering impatiently beside them kerpow splat continued zaphod instantaneously zonked into our component molecules hey ford he said identifying one of the slowly solidifying blurs around him did you get that thing of your whole life flashing before you you got that too said ford your whole life yeah said zaphod at least i assume it was mine i spent a lot of time out of my skulls you know he looked at around him at the various shapes that were at last becoming proper shapes instead of vague an d wobbling shapeless shapes so he said so what said ford so here we are said zaphod hesitantly lying dead standing trillian corrected him er standing dead continued zaphod in this desolate restaurant said arthur d ent who had got to his feet and could now much to his surprise see clearly that is to say the thing that surprised him was not that he could see but what he could see here we are continued zaphod doggedly standing dead in this desolate five star said trillian restaurant concluded zaphod odd isnt it said ford er yeah nice chandeliers though said trillian they looked about themselves in bemusement its not so much an afterlife said arthur more a sort of aprè s vie the chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the low vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not in an ideal universe have been painted in that particular shade of deep turquoise and even if it had been it wouldnt have been highlighted by concealed moodlighting this is not however an ideal universe as was further evidenced by the eye ­‐crossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor and the way in which the fronting for the eighty ­‐yard long marble ­‐topped bar had been made th e fronting for the eighty ­‐yard long marble ­‐ topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand antarean mosaic lizard skins despite the fact that the twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in a few smar tly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar or relaxing in the richly coloured body ­‐hugging seats that were deployed here and there about the bar area a young vlhurg officer and his green steaming young lady passed through the large smoked glass doors at the far end of the bar into the dazzling light of the main body of the restaurant beyond behind arthur was a large curtained bay window he pulled aside the corner of the curtain and looked out at a landscape which under normal circumstances would have given arthur the creeping horrors these were not however normal circumstances for the thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up his back and off the top of his head was the sky the sky was an attendant flunkey polite ly drew the curtain back into place all in good time sir he said zaphods eyes flashed hey hang about you dead guys he said i think were missing some ultra ­‐important thing here you know something somebody said and we missed it arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he had just seen he said i said it was a sort of après yeah and dont you wish you hadnt said zaphod ford i said it was odd yeah shrewd but dull perhaps it was perhaps interrupted the green blur who had by this time resolved into the shape of a small wizened dark ­‐suited green waiter perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks drinks cried zaphod that was it see what you miss if you don t stay alert indeed sir said the waiter patiently if the lady and gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner dinner zaphod exclaimed with passion listen little green person my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night for the mere idea and the universe concluded the waiter determined not to be deflected on his home stretch will explode later for your pleasure fords head swivelled towards him he spoke with feeling wow he said what sort of drinks do you serve in this place the waiter laughed a polite little waiters laugh ah he said i think sir has perhaps misunderstood me oh i hope not breathed ford the waiter coughed a polite little waiters cough it is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented by the time journey he said so if i might suggest time journey said zaphod time journey said ford time journey said trillian you mean this isnt the afterlife said a rthur the waiter smiled a polite little waiters smile he had almost exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic little waiter afterlife sir he said no sir and were not dead said arthur the waiter tightened his lips aha ha he said sir is most evidently alive otherwise i would not attempt to serve sir in an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to describe zaphod beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other hey guys he said this is crazy we finally did it we finally got to where we were going this is milliways yes sir said the waiter laying on the patience with a trowel this is milliways ʹ the restaurant at the end of the universe end of what said arthur the universe repeated the waiter very clearly and unnec essarily distinctly when did that end said arthur in just a few minutes sir said the waiter he took a deep breath he didnt need to do this since his body was supplied with the peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival from

major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother there is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well ­‐adjusted family cant cope with there is also no problem about changing the course of history ʹ the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw all the important chan ges have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end the major problem is quite simply one of grammar and the main work to consult in this matter is

ʹ jumping forward two days in order to avoid it the event will be described differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time from a time in the

which is why the advertising executives of the star system of bastablon came up with this slogan if youve done six impossible things this morning why not round it off with breakfast at milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe chapter at the bar zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt his heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch he was miserably happy zaphod said ford whilst youre still capable of speech would you care to tell me what the photon happened where have you been where have we been small matter but id like it cleared up zaphods left head sobered up leaving his right to sink further into the obscurity of drink yeah he said ive been around they want me to find the man who rules the universe but i dont care to meet him i believe the man cant cook his left h ead watched his right head saying this and then nodded true it said have another drink ford had another pan galactic gargle blaster the drink which has been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging ­‐expensive and bad for the head whate ver had happened ford decided he didnt really care too much listen ford said zaphod everythings cool and froody you mean everythings under control no said zaphod i do not mean everythings under control that would not be cool and f roody if you want to know what happened lets just say i had the whole situation in my pocket ok ford shrugged zaphod giggled into his drink it frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top a wild ­‐skinne d sky ­‐gypsy approached them and played electric violin at them until zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to go away again the gypsy approached arthur and trillian sitting in another part of the bar i dont know what this place is said arthu r but i think it gives me the creeps have another drink said trillian enjoy yourself which said arthur the two are mutually exclusive poor arthur youre not really cut out for this life are you you call this life youre beginning to sound like marvin marvins the clearest thinker i know how do you think we make this violinist go away the waiter approached your table is ready he said seen from the outside which it never is the restaurant resembles a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten rock each of its arms houses the bars the kitchens the forcefield generators which protect the entire structure and the decayed planet on which it sits and the time turbines which slowly rock the whole affair backwards and forwards across the crucial moment in the centre sits the gigantic golden dome almost a complete globe and it was into this area that zaphod ford arthur and trillian now passed at least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them and covered every available surface the other surfaces were not available because they were already encrusted with jewels precious sea shells from santraginus gold leaf mosaic tiles lizard skins and a million unidentifiable embellishm ents and decorations glass glittered silver shone gold gleamed arthur dent goggled wowee said zaphod zappo incredible breathed arthur the people the things the things said ford prefect quietly are also people the peopl e resumed arthur the other people the lights said trillian the tables said arthur the clothes said trillian the waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs the end of the universe is very popular said zaphod threading his way unsteadily through the throng of tables some made of marble some of rich ultra ­‐mahagony some even of platinum and at each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves a nd studying menus people like to dress up for it continued zaphod gives it a sense of occasion the tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central stage area where a small band were playing light music at least a thousand tables was ar thurs guess and interspersed amongst them were swaying palms hissing fountains grotesque statuary in short all the paraphernalia common to all restaurants where little expense has been spared to give the impression that no expense has been spared arthur glanced around half expecting to see someone making an american express commercial zaphod lurched into ford who lurched back into zaphod wowee said zaphod zappo said ford my great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computers works you know said zaphod i told it to take us to the nearest place to eat and it sends us to the end of the universe remind me to be nice to it one day he paused hey everybodys here you know everybody who was anybody was said arthur at the end of the universe you have to use the past tense a lot said zaphod cos everythings been done you know hi guys he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms how did you do is that zaphod beeblebrox asked one iguana of another iguana i think so replied the second iguana well doesnt that just take the biscuit said the first iguana funny old thing life said the second iguana its what you make of it sai d the first and they lapsed back into silence they were waiting for the greatest show in the universe hey zaphod said ford grabbing for his arm and on account of the third pan galactic gargle blaster missing he pointed a swaying finger there s an old mate of mine he said hotblack desiato see the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on zaphod tried to follow fords finger with his eyes but it made him feel dizzy finally he saw oh yeah he said then recognition came a m oment later hey he said did that guy ever make it megabig wow bigger than the biggest thing ever other than me whos he supposed to be asked trillian hotblack desiato said zaphod in astonishment you dont know you never heard of disa ster area no said trillian who hadnt the biggest said ford loudest richest suggested zaphod rock band in the history of he searched for the word history itself said zaphod no said trillian zowee said z aphod here we are at the end of the universe and you havent even lived yet did you miss out he led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at the table arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance hey er hotblack he called out how you doing great to see you big boy hows the noise youre looking great really very very fat and unwell amazing he slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response the pan galactic gargle blasters swirling round inside him told him to plunge on regardless remember the old days he said we used to hang out right the bistro illegal remember slims throat emporium the evil drome boozarama great days eh hotblack desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great days or not ford was not perturbed and when we were hungry wed pose as public health inspectors you remember that and go around confiscating meals an d drinks right till we got food poisoning oh and then there were the long nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above the cafe lou in gretchen town new betel and you were always in the next room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all hated them and you said you didnt care and we said we did because we hated them so much fords eyes were beginning to mist over and you said you didnt want to be a star he continued wallowing in nostalgia because you despised the star system and we said hadra and sulijoo and me that we didnt think you had the option and what do you do now you buy star systems he turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables here he said is a man who buys star systems hotblack desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this fact and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly i think someones drunk muttered a purple bush ­‐like being into his wine glass ford staggered slightly and sat down heavily on the chair facing hotblack desiato whats that number you do he said unwisely grabbing at a bottle for support and tipping it over ʹ into a nearby glass as it happened not to waste a happy accident he drained the glass that really huge number he continued how does it go bwarm bwarm baderr something and in the stage act you do it ends up with this ship crashing right into the sun and you actually do it ford crashed his fist into his o ther hand to illustrate this feat graphically he knocked the bottle over again ship sun wham bang he cried i mean forget lasers and stuff you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn oh and terrible songs his eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on to the table something ought to be done about it he thought hey you want a drink he said it began to sink into his squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion a nd that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said hi ford or great to see you after all this time or in fact anything at all more to the point he had not yet even moved hotblack said ford a large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and pushed him aside he slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand th e owner was not hard to spot on account of his being something of the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it in fact he was built the way one builds leather sofas shiny lumpy and with lots of solid stuffing the suit into which the man s body had been stuffed looked as if its only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into a suit the face had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple but there the resemblance to anything sweet ende d kid said a voice which emerged from the mans mouth as if it had been having a really rough time down in his chest er yeah said ford conversationally he staggered back to his feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didnt c ome further up the mans body beat it said the man oh yeah said ford wondering how wise he was being and who are you the man considered this for a moment he wasnt used to being asked this sort of question nevertheless after a while he c ame up with an answer im the guy whos telling you to beat it he said before you get it beaten for you now listen said ford nervously ʹ he wished his head would stop spinning settle down and get to grips with the situation ʹ now listen he continued i am one of hotblacks oldest friends and he glanced at hotblack desiato who still hadnt moved so much as an eyelash and said ford again wondering what would be a good word to say after and the large man came up with a w hole sentence to go after and he said it and i am mr desiatos bodyguard it went and i am responsible for his body and i am not responsible for yours so take it away before it gets damaged now wait a minute said ford no minutes boom ed the bodyguard no waiting mr desiato speaks to no one well perhaps youd let him say what he thinks about the matter himself said ford he speaks to no one bellowed the bodyguard ford glanced anxiously at hotblack again and was forced to admit to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side there was still not the slightest sign of movement let alone keen interest in fords welfare why said ford whats the matter with him the bodyguard told him chapter the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy notes that disaster area a plutonium rock band from the gagrakacka mind zones are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the galaxy but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all regular conce rt goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty ­‐seven miles from the stage whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet ʹ or more frequently around a completely different planet their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy ­‐being meets girl ­‐being beneath a silvery moon which then explodes for n o adequately explored reason many worlds have now banned their act altogether sometimes for artistic reasons but most commonly because the bands public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties this has not however stopp ed their earnings from pushing back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics and their chief research accountant has recently been appointed professor of neomathematics at the university of maximegalon in recognition of both his general and his special th eories of disaster area tax returns in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space ­‐time continuum is not merely curved it is in fact totally bent ford staggered back to the table where zaphod arthur and trillian were sitting waiting for the fu n to begin gotta have some food said ford hi ford said zaphod you speak to the big noise boy ford waggled his head noncommittally hotblack i sort of spoke to him yeah whatd he say well not a lot really hes er yeah hes spending a year dead for tax reasons ive got to sit down he sat down the waiter approached would you like to see the menu he said or would you like to meet the dish of the day huh said ford huh said arthur huh s aid trillian thats cool said zaphod well meet the meat in a small room in one of the arms of the restaurant complex a tall thin gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in the face it was not a pretty face perhaps because oblivion had looked him in it so many times it was too long for a start the eyes too sunken and too hooded the cheeks too hollow his lips were too thin and too long and when they parted his teeth looked too mu ch like a recently polished bay window the hands that held the curtain were long and thin too they were also cold they lay lightly along the folds of the curtain and gave the impression that if he didnt watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of t heir own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner he let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his features went off to play somewhere more healthy he prowled around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evenings preying finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes a bell rang he pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up his hands brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow ­‐coloured sequins with which his jacket was festooned and he was gone through the door in the restaurant the lights dimmed the band quickened its pace a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that led up to the centre of the stage up the stairs bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure he burst on to the stage tripped lightly up to the microphone removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long thin hand and stood for a moment bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging th eir applause and displaying to them his bay window he waved to his particular friends in the audience even though there werent any there and waited for the applause to die down he held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely from ear to ear but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere confines of his face thank you ladies and gentlemen he cried thank you very much thank you so much he eyed them with a twinkling eye ladies and gentlemen he said the universe as we kno w it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour so welcome one and all to milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe with a gesture he deftly con jured another round of spontaneous applause with another gesture he cut it i am your host for tonight he said my name is max quordlepleen everybody knew this his act was famous throughout the known galaxy but he said it for the fresh applaus e it generated which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and wave and ive just come straight from the very very other end of time where ive been hosting a show at the big bang burger bar ʹ where i can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and gentlemen ʹ and i will be with you right through this historic occasion the end of history itself another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed down further on every table candles ignited themselves spontaneously elicit ing a slight gasp from all the diners and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million intimate shadows a tremor of excitement thrilled through the darkened restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very very slowly to dim to darken to fade maxs voice was hushed as he continued so ladies and gentlemen he breathed the candles are lit the band plays softly and as the force ­‐shielded dome above us fades into transparency revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars i can see were all in for a fabulous evenings apocalypse even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock descended on all those who had not seen this sight before a monstrous grisly ligh t poured in on them ʹ a hideous light ʹ a boiling pestilential light ʹ a light that would have disfigured hell the universe was coming to an end for a few interminable seconds the restaurant span silently through the raging void then max spo ke again for those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the tunnel he said this is it the band struck up again thank you ladies and gentlemen cried max ill be back with you again in just a moment and meanwhile i leave yo u in the very capable hands of mr reg nullify and his cataclysmic combo big hand please ladies and gentlemen for reg and the boys the baleful turmoil of the skies continued hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so normal conver sation resumed max began his round of the tables swapping jokes shouting with laughter earning his living a large dairy animal approached zaphod beeblebroxs table a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes small horns an d what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips good evening it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches i am the main dish of the day may i interest you in parts of my body it harrumphed and gurgled a bit wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at the m its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from arthur and trillian a resigned shrug from ford prefect and naked hunger from zaphod beeblebrox something off the shoulder perhaps suggested the animal braised in a white wine sauce er your shoulder said arthur in a horrified whisper but naturally my shoulder sir mooed the animal contentedly nobody elses is mine to offer zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animals shoulder appreciatively or th e rump is very good murmured the animal ive been exercising it and eating plenty of grain so theres a lot of good meat there it gave a mellow grunt gurgled again and started to chew the cud it swallowed the cud again or a casserole of me perh aps it added you mean this animal actually wants us to eat it whispered trillian to ford me said ford with a glazed look in his eyes i dont mean anything thats absolutely horrible exclaimed arthur the most revolting thing ive ever heard whats the problem earthman said zaphod now transferring his attention to the animals enormous rump i just dont want to eat an animal thats standing here inviting me to said arthur its heartless better than eating an animal tha t doesnt want to be eaten said zaphod thats not the point arthur protested then he thought about it for a moment alright he said maybe it is the point i dont care im not going to think about it now ill just er the universe rag ed about him in its death throes i think ill just have a green salad he muttered may i urge you to consider my liver asked the animal it must be very rich and tender by now ive been force ­‐feeding myself for months a green salad said ar thur emphatically a green salad said the animal rolling his eyes disapprovingly at arthur are you going to tell me said arthur that i shouldnt have green salad well said the animal i know many vegetables that are very clear on that po int which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly and here i am it managed a very slight bow glass of water p lease said arthur look said zaphod we want to eat we dont want to make a meal of the issues four rare steaks please and hurry we havent eaten in five hundred and seventy ­‐six thousand million years the animal staggered to its feet it gave a mellow gurgle a very wise choice sir if i may say so very good it said ill just nip off and shoot myself he turned and gave a friendly wink to arthur dont worry sir he said ill be very humane it waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen a matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge steaming steaks zaphod and ford wolfed straight into them without a seconds hesitation trillian paused then shrugged and started into hers arthu r stared at his feeling slightly ill hey earthman said zaphod with a malicious grin on the face that wasnt stuffing itself whats eating you and the band played on all around the restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted the air was f illed with talk of this and that and with the mingled scents of exotic plants extravagant foods and insidious wines for an infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax glancing at his watch m ax returned to the stage with a flourish and now ladies and gentlemen he beamed is everyone having one last wonderful time yes called out the sort of people who call out yes when comedians ask them if theyre having a wonderful time that s wonderful enthused max absolutely wonderful and as the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us preparing to tear apart the last of the red hot suns i know youre all going to settle back and enjoy with me what i know we will find all an immensely exciting and terminal experience he paused he caught the audience with a glittering eye believe me ladies and gentlemen he said theres nothing penultimate about this one he paused again tonight his timing was immaculate time af ter time he had done this show night after night not that the word night had any meaning here at the extremity of time all there was the endless repetition of the final moment as the restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of times furthest ed ge ʹ and back again this night was good though the audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand his voice dropped they had to strain to hear him this he said really is the absolute end the final chilling desolation in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes extinct this ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial it he dropped his voice still lower in the stillness a fly would not have dared clear its throat after this he said there is nothing void emptiness ob livion absolute nothing his eyes glittered again ʹ or did they twinkle nothing except of course for the sweet trolley and a fine selection of aldebaran liqueurs the band gave him a musical sting he wished they wouldnt he didnt need it not an artist of his calibre he could play the audience like his own musical instrument they were laughing with relief he followed on and for once he cried cheerily yo u dont need to worry about having a hangover in the morning ʹ because there wont be any more mornings he beamed at his happy laughing audience he glanced up at the sky going through the same dead routine every night but his glance was only for a f raction of a second he trusted it to do its job as one professional trusts another and now he said strutting about the stage at the risk of putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here this evening i would like to welcome a few parties he pulled a card from his pocket do we have he put up a hand to hold back the cheers do we have a party here from the zansellquasure flamarion bridge club from beyond the vortvoid of qvarne are they here a rousing cheer came fro m the back but he pretended not to hear he peered around trying to find them are they here he asked again to elict a louder cheer he got it as he always did ah there they are well last bids lads ʹ and no cheating remember this is a very s olemn moment he lapped up the laughter and do we also have do we have a party of minor deities from the halls of asgard away to his right came a rumble of thunder lightning arced across the stage a small group of hairy men with helmets sat looking very pleased with themselves and raised their glasses to him hasbeens he thought to himself careful with that hammer s ir he said they did their trick with the lightning again max gave them a very thin lipped smile and thirdly he said thirdly a party of young conservatives from sirius b are they here a party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing ro lls at each other and started throwing rolls at the stage they yapped and barked unintelligibly yes said max well this is all your fault you realize that and finally said max quieting the audience down and putting on his solemn face final ly i believe we have with us here tonight a party of believers very devout believers from the church of the second coming of the great prophet zarquon there were about twenty of them sitting right out on the edge of the floor ascetically dressed s ipping mineral water nervously and staying apart from the festivities they blinked resentfully as the spotlight was turned on them there they are said max sitting there patiently he said hed come again and hes kept you waiting a long time so lets hope hes hurrying fellas because hes only got eight minutes left the party of zarquons followers sat rigid refusing to be buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them max restrained his audience no but seriously though folks seriously though no offence meant no i know we shouldnt make fun of deeply held beliefs so i think a big hand please for the great prophet zarquon the audience clapped respectfully wherever hes got to he blew a kiss to t he stony ­‐faced party and returned to the centre of the stage he grabbed a tall stool and sat on it its marvellous though he rattled on to see so many of you here tonight ʹ no isnt it though yes absolutely marvellous because i know that so man y of you come here time and time again which i think is really wonderful to come and watch this final end of everything and then return home to your own eras and raise families strive for new and better societies fight terrible wars for what you kn ow to be right it really gives one hope for the future of all lifekind except of course he waved at the blitzing turmoil above and around them that we know it hasnt got one arthur turned to ford ʹ he hadnt quite got this place worked out in his mind look surely he said if the universe is about to end dont we go with it ford gave him a three ­‐pan­‐galactic ­‐gargle ­‐blaster look in other words a rather unsteady one no he said look he said as soon as you come into this div e you get held in this sort of amazing force ­‐shielded temporal warp thing i think oh said arthur he turned his attention back to a bowl of soup hed managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak look said ford ill show you he grabb ed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with it look he said again imagine this napkin right as the temporal universe right and this spoon as a transductional mode in the matter curve it took him a while to say this last part and arthur hated to interrupt him thats the spoon i was eating with he said alright said ford imagine this spoon he found a small wooden spoon on a tray of relishes this spoon but found it r ather tricky to pick up no better still this fork hey would you let go of my fork snapped zaphod alright said ford alright alright why dont we say why dont we say that this wine glass is the temporal universe what the one youve just knocked on the floor did i do that yes alright said ford forget that i mean i mean look do you know ʹ do you know how the universe actually began for a kick off probably not said arthur who wished he d never embarked on any of this alright said ford imagine this right you get this bath right a large round bath and its made of ebony where from said arthur harrods was destroyed by the vogons doesnt matter so you keep saying listen alright you get this bath see imagine youve got this bath and its ebony and its conical conical said arthur what sort of shhh said ford its conical so what you do is you see you fill it with fine white sand alright or sugar fine white sand andor sugar anything doesnt matter sugars fine and when its full you pull the plug out are you listening im listening you pull the plug out and it all just twirls away twirls away you see out of t he plughole i see you dont see you dont see at all i havent got to the clever bit yet you want to hear the clever bit tell me the clever bit ill tell you the clever bit ford thought for a moment trying to remember what the clever bit was the clever bit he said is this you film it happening clever thats not the clever bit this is the clever bit i remember now that this is the clever bit the clever bit is that you then thread the film in the projector backward s backwards yes threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit so then you just sit and watch it and everything just appears to spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath see and thats how the universe began is it said ar thur no said ford but its a marvellous way to relax he reached for his wine glass wheres my wine glass he said its on the floor ah tipping back his chair to look for it ford collided with the small green waiter who was approaching the table carrying a portable telephone ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because he was extremely drunk the waiter said that t hat was quite alright and that he perfectly understood ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence attempted to tug his forelock missed by six inches and slid under the table mr zaphod beeblebrox inquired the waiter er yeah said zaphod glancing up from his third steak there is a phone call for you hey what a phone call sir for me here hey but who knows where i am one of his minds raced the other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still shovelling in excuse me if i carry on wont you said his eating head and carried on there were now so many people after him hed lost count he shouldnt have made such a conspicuous entrance hell why not though he thought how do you know youre having fun if theres no one watching you have it maybe someone here tipped off the galactic police said trillian everyone saw you come in you mean they want to arrest me over the phone said zaphod could be im a pretty dangerous dude when im concerned yeah said a voice from under the table you go to pieces so fast people get hit by the shrapnel hey what is this judgment day snapped zaphod do we get to see that as well asked arthur nervously im in no hurry muttered zaphod ok so whos the cat on the phone he kicked ford hey get up there kid he said to him i may need you i am not said the waiter personally acquainted with the metal gentlemen in question sir metal yes sir did you say metal yes sir i said that i am not personally acquainted with the metal gentleman in question ok carry on but i am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a considerable number of millennia it seems you left here somewhat precipitately left here said zaphod are you being strange we only just arrived here indeed sir persisted the waiter doggedly but before you arrived here sir i understand that you left here zaphod tried this in one brain then in the other youre s aying he said that before we arrived here we left here this is going to be a long night thought the waiter precisely sir he said put your analyst on danger money baby advised zaphod no wait a minute said ford emerging above tabl e level again where exactly is here to be absolutely exact sir it is frogstar world b but we just left there protested zaphod we left there and came to the restaurant at the end of the universe yes sir said the waiter feeling that he was now into the home stretch and running well the one was constructed on the ruins of the other oh said arthur brightly you mean weve travelled in time but not in space listen you semi ­‐evolved simian cut in zaphod go climb a tree will you arthur bristled go bang your heads together four ­‐eyes he advised zaphod no no the waiter said to zaphod your monkey has got it right sir arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite or indeed coherent you jumped forward i believe five hundred and seventy ­‐six thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place explained the waiter he smiled he had a wonderful feeling that he had finally won through against what had seemed to be insuperable odds thats i t said zaphod i got it i told the computer to send us to the nearest place to eat thats exactly what it did give or take five hundred and seventy ­‐six thousand million years we never moved neat they all agreed this was very neat but who sa id zaphod is the cat on the phone whatever happened to marvin said trillian zaphod clapped his hands to his heads the paranoid android i left him moping about on frogstar b when was this well er five hundred and seventy ­‐six thousand million years ago i suppose said zaphod hey er hand me the rap ­‐rod plate captain the little waiters eyebrows wandered about his forehead in confusion i beg your pardon sir he said the phone waiter said zaphod grabbing it off him shee you guys are so unhip its a wonder your bums dont fall off indeed sir hey marvin is that you said zaphod into the phone how you doing kid there was a long pause before a thi n low voice came up the line i think you ought to know im feeling very depressed it said zaphod cupped his hands over the phone its marvin he said hey marvin he said into the phone again were having a great time food wine a little personal abuse and the universe going foom where can we find you again the pause you dont have to pretend to be interested in me you know said marvin at last i know perfectly well im only a menial robot ok ok said zaphod but where ar e you reverse primary thrust marvin thats what they say to me open airlock number three marvin marvin can you pick up that piece of paper can i pick up that piece of paper here i am brain the size of a planet and they ask me to yeah yeah sympathized zaphod hardly at all but im quite used to being humiliated droned marvin i can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water ive got one ready wait a minute er hey marvin interrupted zaphod but it was too late sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line whats he saying asked trillian nothing said zaphod he just phoned up to wash his head at us there said marvin comi ng back on the line and bubbling a bit i hope that gave satisfaction yeah yeah said zaphod now will you please tell us where you are im in the car park said marvin the car park said zaphod what are you doing there parking car s what else does one do in a car park ok hang in there well be right down in one movement zaphod leapt to his feet threw down the phone and wrote hotblack desiato on the bill come on guys he said marvins in the car park lets get on down whats he doing in the car park asked arthur parking cars what else dum dum but what about the end of the universe well miss the big moment ive seen it its rubbish said zaphod nothing but a gnab gib a what opposite of a big bang come on lets get zappy few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved their way through the restaurant to the exit their eyes were riveted on the horror of the skies an interesting effect to watch for max was telling them is in the upper left ­‐hand quadrant of the sky where if you look very carefully you can see the star system hastromil boiling away into the ultra ­‐violet anyone here from hastromil there were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at the back well said max beaming cheerfully at them its too late to worry about whether you left the gas on now chapter the main reception foyer was almost empty but ford nevertheless weaved his way through it zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall what are you doing to him asked arthur sobering him up said zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot lights flashed gases swirled hi said ford stepping out a moment later where are we going down to the car park come on what about the personnel time teleports said ford get us straight back to the heart of gold yeah but ive cooled on that ship zarniwoop can have i t i dont want to play his games lets see what we can find a sirius cybernetics corporation happy vertical people transporter took them down deep into the substrata beneath the restaurant they were glad to see it had been vandalized and didnt try t o make them happy as well as take them down at the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of cold stale air hit them the first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory faci lities for all of fifty major lifeforms nevertheless like every car park in the galaxy throughout the entire history of car parks this car park smelt predominantly of impatience they turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk that traver sed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim distance it was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship belonging to one of the diners upstairs some smallish and utilitarian mass production models others vast shining limos hips the playthings of the very rich zaphods eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have been avarice as he passed over them in fact its best to be clear on this point ­‐avarice is definitely what it was there he is said trillian marvin down there they looked where she was pointing dimly they could see a small metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner of a giant silver suncruiser at short intervals along the moving catwal k wide transparent tubes led down to floor level zaphod stepped off the catwalk into one and floated gently downwards the others followed thinking back to this later arthur dent thought it was the single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the galaxy hey marvin said zaphod striding over towards to him hey kid are we pleased to see you marvin turned and in so far as it is possible for a totally inert metal face to look reproachfully this is what it did no youre not he said no one ever is suit yourself said zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships ford went with him only trillian and arthur actually went up to marvin no really we are said trillian and patted him in a way that he disliked intensely hanging ar ound waiting for us all this time five hundred and seventy ­‐six thousand million three thousand five hundred and seventy ­‐nine years said marvin i counted them well here we are now said trillian fe eling ʹ quite correctly in marvins view ʹ that it was a slightly foolish thing to say the first ten million years were the worst said marvin and the second ten million years they were the worst too the third million years i didnt enjoy at all after that i went into a bit of decline he paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say something and then interrupted its the people you meet in this job that really get you down he said and paused again trillian cleared her throat is that the best conversation i had was over forty million years ago continued marvin again the pause oh d and that was with a coffee machine he waited thats a you dont like talking to me do you said marvin in a low desolate tone trillian talked to arthur i nstead further down the chamber ford prefect had found something of which he very much liked the look several such things in fact zaphod he said in a quiet voice just look at some of these little star trolleys zaphod looked and liked the craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but extraordinary and very much a rich kids toy it was not much to look at it resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about twenty feet long made of thin but tough metal foil at the rear end wa s a small horizontal two ­‐man cockpit it had a tiny charm ­‐drive engine which was not capable of moving it at any great speed the thing it did have however was a heat ­‐sink the heat ­‐sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and was contained wi thin a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic field situated half ­‐way along the length of the ship and this heat ­‐sink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow sun there to catch and ride the solar flares that burst out from its surface flare ­‐riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the most lionized men in the galaxy it is also of course stupefyingly dangerous ʹ those who dont die riding invari ably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the daedalus clubs après ­‐flare parties ford and zaphod looked and passed on and this baby said ford the tangerine star buggy with the black sunbusters again the star buggy was a small ship ʹ a totally misnamed one in fact because the one thing it couldnt manage was interstellar distances basically it was a sporty planet hopper dolled up to something it wasnt nice lines though they passed on the next one was a big one and thirty yards long ʹ a coach built limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind that of making the beholder sick with envy the paintwork and accessory detail clearly said not only am i rich enough to afford this ship i am also rich enough not to take it seriously it was wonderfully hideous just look at it said zaphod multi ­‐cluster quark drive perspulex running boards got to be a lazlar lyricon custom job he examined every inch yes he said look the infra ­‐pink lizard emblem on the neutrino cowling lazlars trade mark the man has no shame i was passed by one of these mothers once out by the axel nebula said ford i was going flat out and this thing just strolled past me star drive hardly ticking over just incredible zaphod whistled appr eciatively ten seconds later said ford it smashed straight into the third moon of jaglan beta yeah right amazing looking ship though looks like a fish moves like a fish steers like a cow ford looked round the other side hey come a nd see he called out theres a big mural painted on this side a bursting sun ʹ disaster areas trade mark this must be hotblacks ship lucky old bugger they do this terrible song you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun meant to be an amazing spectacle expensive in stunt ships though zaphods attention however was elsewhere his attention was riveted on the ship standing next to hotblack desiatos limo his mouths hung open that he said that is really bad for the eye s ford looked he too stood astonished it was a ship of classic simple design like a flattened salmon twenty yards long very clean very sleek there was just one remarkable thing about it its so black said ford prefect you can hardly make out its shape light just seems to fall into it zaphod said nothing he had simply fallen in love the blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible to tell how close you were standing to it your eyes just slide off it sai d ford in wonder it was an emotional moment he bit his lip zaphod moved forward to it slowly like a man possessed ʹ or more accurately like a man who wanted to possess his hand reached out to stroke it his hand stopped his hand reached out to stro ke it again his hand stopped again come and feel the surface he said in a hushed voice ford put his hand out to feel it his hand stopped you you cant he said see said zaphod its just totally frictionless this must be one mother of a mover he turned to look at ford seriously at least one of his heads did ʹ the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship what do you reckon ford he said you mean er ford looked over his shoulder you mean stroll off with it you think we should no nor do i but were going to arent we how can we not they gazed a little longer till zaphod suddenly pulled himself together we better shift soon he said in a moment or so the universe will have ended and all the captain creeps will be pouring down here to find their bourge ­‐mobiles zaphod said ford yeah how do we do it simple said zaphod he turned marv in he called slowly laboriously and with a million little clanking and creaking noises that he had learned to simulate marvin turned round to answer the summons come on over here said zaphod weve got a job for you marvin trudged towards t hem i wont enjoy it he said yes you will enthused zaphod theres a whole new life stretching out ahead of you oh not another one groaned marvin will you shut up and listen hissed zaphod this time theres going to be excitement an d adventure and really wild things sounds awful marvin said marvin all im trying to ask you i suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you what er yes yeah thats right said zaphod jumpily he was keeping at least three e yes on the entrance time was short well i wish youd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm said marvin because i havent got one he walked on up to the ship touched it and a hatchway swung open ford and zaphod stared at the op ening dont mention it said marvin oh you didnt he trudged away again arthur and trillian clustered round whats happening asked arthur look at this said ford look at the interior of this ship weirder and weirder breathed zaphod its black said ford everything in it is just totally black in the restaurant things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldnt be any more moments all eyes were fixed on the dome ot her than those of hotblack desiatos bodyguard which were looking intently at hotblack desiato and those of hotblack desiato himself which the bodyguard had closed out of respect the bodyguard leaned forward over the table had hotblack desiato been al ive he probably would have deemed this a good moment to lean back or even go for a short walk his bodyguard was not a man which improved with proximity on account of his unfortunate condition however hotblack desiato remained totally inert mr des iato sir whispered the bodyguard whenever he spoke it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were clambering over each other to get out of the way mr desiato can you hear me hotblack desiato quit naturally said nothing hotbl ack hissed the bodyguard again quite naturally hotblack desiato did not reply supernaturally however he did on the table in front of him a wine glass rattled and a fork rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass it settled on the table ag ain the bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt its time we get going mr desiato muttered the bodyguard dont want to get caught in the rush not in your condition you want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed there was a really big audience for it one of the best kakrafoon five ­‐hundred seventy ­‐six thousand and two million years ago had you will have been looking forward to it the fork rose again waggled in a non ­‐committal sort of way and dropped again ah come on said the bodyguard its going to have been great you knocked em cold the bodyguard would have given dr dan streetmentioner an apoplectic attack the black ship going into the sun always gets em and the new ones a beauty be real sorry to see it go if we get on do wn there ill set the black ship autopilot and well cruise off in the limo ok the fork tapped once in agreement and the glass of wine mysteriously emptied itself the bodyguard wheeled hotblack desiatos chair out of the restaurant and now cri ed max from the centre of the stage the moment youve all been waiting for he flung his arms into the air behind him the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords max had argued with them about this but they had claimed it was i n their contract that thats what they would do his agent would have to sort it out the skies begin to boil he cried nature collapses into the screaming void in twenty seconds time the universe itself will be at an end see where the light of in finity bursts in upon us the hideous fury of destruction blazed about them ʹ and at that moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance maxs eyes swivelled round to glare at the band none of them seemed to be playing a trumpet suddenly a wisp of smoke was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him the trumpet was joined by more trumpets over five hundred times max had done this show and nothing like this had ever happened before he drew back in alarm from the swirling smoke and as he did so a figure slowly materialized inside the figure of an anci ent man bearded robed and wreathed in light in his eyes were stars and on his brow a golden crown whats this whispered max wild ­‐eyed whats happening at the back of the restaurant the stony ­‐faced party from the church of the second coming of the great prophet zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying max blinked in amazement he threw up his arms to the audience a big hand please ladies and gentlemen he hollered for the great prophet zarquon he has come zarquon has come again thunderous applause broke out as max strode across the stage and handed his microphone to the prophet zarquon coughed he peered round at the ass embled gathering the stars in his eyes blinked uneasily he handled the microphone with confusion er he said hello er look im sorry im a bit late ive had the most ghastly time all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment he seeme d nervous of the expectant awed hush he cleared his throat er how are we for time he said have i just got a min ʹ and so the universe ended chapter one of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel book the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy apart from its relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words dont panic written in large friendly letters on its cover is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary the statistics relating to the geo ­‐social nature of the universe for instance are deftly set out between pages nine hundred and thirty ­‐eight thousand and twenty ­‐four and nine hundred and thirty ­‐eight thousand and twenty ­‐six and the simplistic style in which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors having to meet a publishing deadline copied the information off the back of a packet of breakfast cereal hastily embroidering it with a few footnoted in order to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly tortuous galactic copyri ght laws it is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book backwards in time through a temporal warp and then successfully sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement of the same laws here is a sample the universe ʹ some information to help you live in it area infinite the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy offers this definition of the word infinite infinite bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some much bigger than that in fact really amazingly imme nse a totally stunning size wow thats big time infinity is just so big that by comparison bigness itself looks really titchy gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept were trying to get across here imports none it is impossible to import things into an infinite area there being no outside to import things in from exports none see imports population none it is known that there are an infinite number of worlds simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in however not every one of them is inhabited therefore there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds any finite number div ided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds so the average population of all the planets in the universe can be said to be zero from this it follows that the population of the whole universe is also zero and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination monetary units none in fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the galaxy but none of them count the altairan dollar has recently collapsed the flaninian pobble bead is only exchangeable for other flaninian pobble beads and the triganic pu has its own very special problems its exchange rate of eight ningis to one pu is simple enough but since a ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles acros s each side no one has ever collected enough to own one pu ningis are not negotiable currency because the galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling small change from this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination art none the function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature and there simply isnt a mirror big enough ʹ see point one sex none well in fact there is an awful lot of this largely because of the total lack o f money trade banks art or anything else that might keep all the non ­‐existent people of the universe occupied however it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now because it really is terribly complicated for further information see guide chapters seven nine ten eleven fourteen sixteen seventeen nineteen twenty ­‐one to eighty ­‐four inclusive and in fact most of the rest of the guide chapter the restaurant continued existing but everything else had stopped temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that wasnt merely a vacuum it was simply nothing ʹ there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist the force ­‐shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque the party was over the din ers were leaving zarquon had vanished along with the rest of the universe the time turbines were preparing to pull the restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for the lunch sitting and max quordlepleen was back in his small curtained dress ing room trying to raise his agent on the tempophone in the car park stood the black ship closed and silent in to the car park came the late mr hotblack desiato propelled along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard they descended one of the tubes a s they approached the limoship a hatchway swung down from its side engaged the wheels of the wheelchair and drew it inside the bodyguard followed and having seen his boss safely connected up to his death ­‐support system moved up to the small cockpit he re he operated the remote control system which activated the autopilot in the black ship lying next to the limo thus causing great relief to zaphod beeblebrox who had been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes the black ship glided smoothly for ward out of its bay turned and moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly at the end it accelerated rapidly flung itself into the temporal launch chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past the milliways lunch menu quotes by permission a passage from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy the passage is this the history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases those of survival inquiry and sophistication otherw ise known as the how why and where phases for instance the first phase is characterized by the question how can we eat the second by the question why do we eat and the third by the question where shall we have lunch the menu goes on to sug gest that milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third question what it doesnt go on to say is that though it will usually take a large civilization many thousands of years to pas s through the how why and where phases small social groupings under stressful conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity how are we doing said arthur dent badly said ford prefect where are we going said trillian i dont know said zaphod beeblebrox why not demanded arthur dent shut up suggested zaphod beeblebrox and ford prefect basically what youre trying to say said arthur dent ignoring this suggestion is that were out of control the ship was rockin g and swaying sickeningly as ford and zaphod tried to wrest control from the autopilot the engined howled and whined like tired children in a supermarket its the wild colour scheme that freaks me said zaphod whose love affair with this ship had last ed almost three minutes into the flight every time you try to operate on of these weird black controls that are labelled in black on a black background a little black light lights up black to let you know youve done it what is this some kind of galac tic hyperhearse the walls of the swaying cabin were also black the ceiling was black the seats ʹ which were rudimentary since the only important trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be unmanned ʹ were black the control panel was black the instruments were black the little screws that held them in place were black the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black and when they had lifted up a corner of it they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wavelengths offered trillian or didnt have much imagination muttered arthur perhaps said marvin he was feeling very depressed in fact though they werent to know it the decor had been chosen in honour of its owners sad lamented and tax ­‐deductible condition the ship gave a particularly sickening lurch take it easy pleaded arthur youre making me space sick time s ick said ford were plummeting backwards through time thank you said arthur now i think i really am going to be ill go ahead said zaphod we could do with a little colour about this place this is meant to be a polite after ­‐dinner con versation is it snapped arthur zaphod left the controls for ford to figure out and lurched over to arthur look earthman he said angrily youve got a job to do right the question to the ultimate answer right what that thing said arthur i thought wed forgotten about that not me baby like the mice said its worth a lot of money in the right quarters and its all locked up in that head thing of yours yes but but nothing think about it t he meaning of life we get our fingers on that we can hold every shrink in the galaxy up to ransom and thats worth a bundle i owe mine a mint arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm alright he said but where do we start how should i know they say the ultimate answer or whatever is forty ­‐two how am i supposed to know what the question is it could be anything i mean whats six times seven zaphod looked at him hard for a moment then his eyes blazed with excitement forty ­‐two he cried arthur wiped his palm across his forehead yes he said patiently i know that zaphods faces fell im just saying that the question could be anything at all said arthur and i dont see how i am meant to know because hissed zaphod you were there when your planet did the big firework we have a thing on earth began arthur had corrected zaphod called tact oh never mind look i just dont know a low voice echoed dully round the cabin i know said m arvin ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing battle with stay out of this marvin he said this is organism talk its printed in the earthmans brainwave patterns continued marvin but i dont suppose youll be very interested in knowing that you mean said arthur you mean you can see into my mind yes said marvin arthur stared in astonishment and he said it amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small ah said arthur abuse yes confirmed marvin ah ignore him said zaphod hes only making it up making it up said marvin swivelling his head in a parod y of astonishment why should i want to make anything up lifes bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it marvin said trillian in the gentle kindly voice that only she was still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature if you knew all along why then didnt you tell us marvins head swivelled back to her you didnt ask he said simply well were asking you now metal man said ford turning round to look at him at that moment the ship suddenly s topped rocking and swaying the engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum hey ford said zaphod that sounds good have you worked out the controls of this boat no said ford i just stopped fiddling with them i reckon we just go to wherever t his ship is going and get off it fast yeah right said zaphod i could tell you werent really interested murmured marvin to himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off trouble is said ford that the one instrument in this wh ile ship that is giving any reading is worrying me if it is what i think it is and if its saying what i think its saying then weve already gone too far back into the past maybe as much as two million years before our own time zaphod shrugged time is bunk he said i wonder who this ship belongs to anyway said arthur me said zaphod no who it really belongs to really me insisted zaphod look property is theft right therefore theft is property therefore this ship is mine ok tell the ship that said arthur zaphod strode over to the console ship he said banging on the panels this is your new owner speaking to he got no further several things happened at once the ship dropped out of time travel mode and re ­‐emerged into real space all the controls on the console which had been shut down for the time trip now lit up a large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them none of these things however were responsible for the fact that zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards aga inst the rear of the cabin as were all the others they were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thuddered out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen chapter down on the dry red world of kakrafoon in the midd le of the vast rudlit desert the stage technicians were testing the sound system that is to say the sound system was in the desert not the stage technicians they had retreated to the safety of disaster areas giant control ship which hung in orbit so me four hundred miles above the surface of the planet and they were testing the sound system from there anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldnt have survived the tuning up if arthur dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos th en his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled manhattan risen out of the silos the neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seism ic amps behind them buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship the massive photon ­‐ajuitar the bass detonator and the megabang drum complex it was going to be a noi sy show aboard the giant control ship all was activity and bustle hotblack desiatos limoship a mere tadpole beside it had arrived and docked and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard a doctor a logician and a marine biologist had also just arrived flown in at phenomenal expense from maximegalon to try to reason with the lead singer who had locked himself in the bat hroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasnt a fish the bass player was busy machine ­‐gunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on board frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a beach on santraginus v over a hundred light years away where he claimed he had been happy over half an hour now and had found a small stone that would be his friend the bands manager was profoundly relieved it meant that for the seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would be right the sub ­‐ether was buzzing with the communications of the stage technicians testing the speaker channels and this it was that was being relayed to the interior of the black ship its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin and listened to the voices on the monitor speakers ok channel nine on power said a voice testing channel fifteen another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship channel fifteen aok said another voice a third voice cut in the black stunt ship is now in position it said its looking good gonna be a great sundive stage computer on line a computer voice answered on line it said take control of the black ship black ship locked into trajectory programme on standby testing channel twenty zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the sub­‐ether receiver bef ore the next mind ­‐pulverizing noise hit them he stood there quivering what said trillian in a small quiet voice does sundive mean it means said marvin that the ship os going to dive into the sun sun dive its very simple to understand what do you expect if you steal hotblack desiatos stunt ship how do you know said zaphod in a voice that would make a vegan snow lizard feel chilly that this is hotblack desiatos stuntship simple said marvin i parked it for him the why didnt you tell us you said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild things this is awful said arthur unnecessarily in the pause which followed thats what i said confirmed marvin on a different frequency the sub­‐ether receiver had picked up a public broadcast which now echoed round the cabin fine weather for the concert here this afternoon im standing here in front of the stage the reporter lied in the middle of the rudlit desert and with the ai d of hyperbinoptic glasses i can just about make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all around me behind me the speaker stacks rise like a sheer cliff face and high above me the sun is shining away and doesnt know whats going to hit it the environmentalist lobby do know whats going to hit it and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes tidal waves hurricanes irreparable damage to the atmosphere and all the usual things that environmentalists usually go on about but i ve just had a report that a representative of disaster area met with the environmentalists at lunchtime and had them all shot so nothing now lies in the way of zaphod switched it off he turned to ford you know what im thinking he said i think so said ford tell me what you think im thinking i think youre thinking its time we get off this ship i think youre right said zaphod i think youre right said ford how said arthur quiet said ford and zaphod were th inking so this is it said arthur were going to die i wish youd stop saying that said ford it is worth repeating at this point the theories that ford had come up with on his first encounter with human beings to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very obvious as it its a nice day or youre very tall or so this is it were going to die his first theory was that if human beings didnt keep exercising their lips their mouths probably seized up after a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory which was this ʹ if human beings dont keep exercising their lips their brains start working in fact this second theory is more literally true of the belcebron people of kakrafoon the belcebron people used to cause great resentment and insecurity amongst neighboring races b y being one of the most enlightened accomplished and above all quiet civilizations in the galaxy as a punishment for this behaviour which was held to be offensively self righteous and provocative a galactic tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases telepathy consequently in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds to anyone within a five mile radius they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather their l ittle aches and pains the match this afternoon and what a noisy place kakrafoon had suddenly become another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play host to a disaster area concert the timing of the concert was critical the ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to hit the sun six minutes and thirty ­‐seven seconds before the climax of the song to which it related so that the light of the solar flares had time to travel out to kakrafoon the ship had already bee n diving for several minutes by the time that ford prefect had completed his search of the other compartments of the black ship he burst back into the cabin the sun of kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen its blazing white inferno o f fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards unheeding the thumping and banging of zaphods hands on the control panel arthur and trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think that the best way o f dealing with approaching headlights is to stare them out zaphod span round wild ­‐eyed ford he said how many escape capsules are there none said ford zaphod gibbered did you count them he yelled twice said ford did you manage to raise the stage crew on the radio yeah said zaphod bitterly i said there were a whole bunch of people on board and they said to say hi to everybody ford goggled didnt you tell them who we were oh yeah they said it was a great hon our that and something about a restaurant bill and my executors ford pushed arthur aside and leaned forward over the control console does none of this function he said savagely all overridden smash the autopilot find it first nothing connects there was a moments cold silence arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin he stopped suddenly incidentally he said what does teleport mean another moment passed slowly the others turned to face him probably the wrong moment to ask said arthur its just i remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and i only bring it up because where said ford prefect quietly does it say teleport well just over here in fact said arthur pointing at a dark control box in the rear of the cabin just under the word emergency above the word system and beside the sign saying out of order in the pandemonium that instantly followed the only act ion to follow was that of ford prefect lunging across the cabin to the small black box that arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the single small black button set into it a six ­‐foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a compartment whic h resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new function in life as an electricians junk store half ­‐finished wiring hung from the ceiling a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on the floor and the programming panel lolled out of the cavit y in the wall into which it should have been secured a junior disaster area accountant visiting the shipyard where this ship was being constructed had demanded to know of the works foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely expensive teleport into a ship which only had one important journey to make and that unmanned the foreman had explained that the teleport was available at a ten percent discount and the accountant had explained that this was immaterial the foreman had explained that it wa s the finest most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could buy and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to buy it the foreman had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the ship and the accountant had ex plained that the ship sported a perfectly serviceable door the foreman had explained that the accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly from his left was a knuckle sandwich after the explanations had been concluded work was discontinued on the teleport which subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as sund explns at five times the price hells donkeys muttered zaphod as he and ford attempted to sort through th e tangle of wiring after a moment or so ford told him to stand back he tossed a coin into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel with a crackle and spit of light the coin vanished that much of it works said ford however there is no guidance system a matter transference teleport without guidance programming could put you well anywhere the sun of kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen who cares said zaphod we go where we go and said ford there is no aut osystem we couldnt all go someone would have to stay and operate it a solemn moment shuffled past the sun loomed larger and larger hey marvin kid said zaphod brightly how you doing very badly i suspect muttered marvin a shortish whi le later the concert on kakrafoon reached an unexpected climax the black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun massive solar flares licked out from it millions of miles into space thrilling an d in a few cases spilling the dozen or so flare riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment moments before the flare light reached kakrafoon the pounding desert cracked along a deep faultline a huge and hit herto undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air instantaneously vaporizing the river both abo ve and below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again those ­‐very few ­‐who witnessed the event and survived swear that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile ­‐thick panc ake flipped itself over and fell back down at that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water and struck the ground a year later the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick with flowers the structure of the atmosphere around the planet was subtly altered the sun blazed less harshly in the summer the cold bit less bitterly in the winter pleasant rain fell more often and slowly the desert world of kakrafoon became a paradise even the tele pathic power with which the people of kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion a spokesman for disaster area ʹ the one who had had all the environmentalists shot ʹ was later quoted as saying that it had been a go od gig many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music a few sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast artificially induced improbability field drifting in from a nearby region of space chapter arthur woke up and instantly regretted it hangovers hed had but never anything on this scale this was it this was the big one this was the ultimate pits matter transference beams he decided were not as much fun as say a good solid kick in the he ad being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull stomping throb he was experiencing he lay a while and thought the trouble with most forms of transport he thought is basically one of them not being worth all the bother on earth ʹ when there had been an earth before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass ʹ the problem had been with cars the disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of harm s way turning it into tar to cover the land with smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another ʹ particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become as a result of this very similar to the place you had left ie covered with tar full of smoke and short of fish and what about matter transference beams any form of transport which invo lved tearing you apart atom by atom flinging those atoms through the sub ­‐ether and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news many people had thought exactly this before a rthur dent and had even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it here is one that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the sirius cybernetics corporation teleport systems factory on happi ­‐werld iii aldebarans great ok algols pr etty neat betelgeuses pretty girls will knock you off your feet theyll do anything you like real fast and then real slow but if you have to take me apart to get me there then i dont want to go singing take me apart take me apart what a way to roam and if you have to take me apart to get me there id rather stay at home sirius is paved with gold so ive heard it said by nuts who then go on to say see tau before youre dead ill gladly take the high road or even take the low but if you have to take me apart to get me there then i for one wont go singing take me apart take me apart you must be off your head and if you try to take me apart to get me there ill stay right here in bed and so on another favorite song was much shorter i teleported home one night with ron and sid and meg ron stole meggies heart away and i got sidneys leg arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding though he was still aware of a dull stomp ing throb slowly carefully he stood up can you hear a dull stomping throb said ford prefect arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly ford prefect was approaching looking red eyed and pasty where are we gasped arthur ford looked around t hey were standing in a long curving corridor which stretched out of sight in both directions the outer steel wall ʹ which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in schools hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued ʹ curved over the tops of their heads where it met the inner perpendicular wall which oddly enough was covered in dark brown hessian wall weave the floor was of dark green ribbed rubber ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the outer wall it was several layers deep yet through it he could see pinpoints of distant stars i think were in a spaceship of some kind he said down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb trillian called arthur nervously zaphod ford shrugged nowhere about he said ive looked they could be anywhere an unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction judging by the way i feel i should think weve travelled a very long way indeed how do you feel bad do you think theyre where they are how they are theres no way we can know and no way we can do anything about it do what i do what dont think about it arthur turned this thought over in his mind reluctantly saw the wisdom o f it tucked it up and put it away he took a deep breath footsteps exclaimed ford suddenly where that noise that stomping throb pounding feet listen arthur listened the noise echoed round the corridor at them from an indeterminate dista nce it was the muffled sound of pounding footsteps and it was noticeably louder lets move said ford sharply they both moved ­‐in opposite directions not that way said ford thats where theyre coming from no its not said arthur they re coming from that way theyre not theyre they both stopped they both turned they both listened intently they both agreed with each other they both set off into opposite directions again fear gripped them from both directions the noise was getting louder a few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner wall they ran to it and hurried along it it was dark immensely long and as they passed down it gave them the impression that it was getting colder and col der other corridors gave off it to the left and right each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed they stopped for a moment in alarm the further down the corridor they went the louder became the sound of pounding feet they pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened furiously the cold the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet was getting to them badly ford shivered partly with the cold but partly with the memory of stories his favourite m other used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a betelgeusian ankle high to an arcturan megagrasshopper stories of dead ships haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotte n crews stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered such ships stories of ʹ then ford remembered the brown hessian wall weave in the first corridor and pulled himself together however ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their deat h hulks he thought to himself he would lay any money you liked it wasnt with hessian wall weave he grasped arthur by the arm back the way we came he said firmly and they started to retrace their steps a moment later they leap like startled lizar ds down the nearest corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in front of them hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber ford prefect stared after them joggers he hissed as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down the network of corridors joggers whispered arthur dent joggers said f ord prefect with a shrug the corridor they were concealed in was not like the others it was very short and ended at a large steel door ford examined it discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide the first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin and the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety ­‐nine things that hit their eyes were also coffins chapter the vault was low ceilinged dimly lit and gigantic at the far e nd about three hundred yards away an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar chamber similarly occupied ford prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the floor of the vault wild he said whats so great about dead people asked arthur nervously stepping down after him dunno said ford lets find out shall we on closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi they stood about waist high and were constructed of w hat appeared to be white marble which is almost certainly what it was ʹ something that only appeared to be white marble the tops were semi ­‐ translucent and through them could dimly be perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants they were humanoid and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was they came from far behind them but beyond that little else could be discerned rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy oily white gas which arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his ankles the sarcophagi too were intensely cold to the touch ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them he pulled a corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at something look theres a plaque on this one he explained to arthur its frosted over he rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters to arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out but ford instantly recognized an early form of galactic eezeereed it says golgafrincham ark fleet ship b hold seven telephone sanitizer second class ʹ and a seri al number a telephone sanitizer said arthur a dead telephone sanitizer best kind but whats he doing here ford peered through the top at the figure within not a lot he said and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his which alway s made people think hed been overdoing things recently and should try to get some rest he scampered over to another sarcophagus a moments brisk towel work and he announced this ones a dead hairdresser hoopy the next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an advertising account executive the one after that contained a second ­‐hand car salesman third class an inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught fords attention and he sq uatted down to unfasten it thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him a thought occurred to arthur if these are just coffins he said why are they kept so cold or indeed why are they kept anyway said ford tugging the hatchway open the gas poured down through it why in fact is anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand dead bodies through space ten thousand said arthur pointing at the archway through which the next chamber was dimly visible ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway he looked up again fifteen thousand he said theres another lot down there fifteen million said a voice thats a lot said ford a lot a lot turn around slowly barked the voice and put your hands up any other move and i blast you into tiny tiny bits hello said ford turning round slowly putting his hands up and not making any other move why said arthur dent isnt anyone ever pleased to see us standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the vault was the man who wasnt pleased to see them his displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he wa ved a long silver kill ­‐o­‐zap gun at them the designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush make it evil hed been told make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them if that means sticking all sort of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it this is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand it is a g un for going out and making people miserable with ford and arthur looked at the gun unhappily the man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them as he came into the light they could see his black and gold uniform on which the buttons wer e so highly polished that they shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash his lights in annoyance he gestured at the door out he said people who can supply that amount of fire power dont need to supply verbs as well ford and arthur went out closely followed by the wrong end of the kill ­‐o­‐zap gun and the buttons turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty ­‐four oncoming joggers now showered and changed who swept on past them into the vault arthur turne d to watch them in confusion move screamed their captor arthur moved ford shrugged and moved in the vault the joggers went to twenty ­‐four empty sarcophagi along the side wall opened them climbed in and fell into twenty ­‐ four dreamless sleeps chapter er captain yes number one just heard a sort of report thingy from number two oh dear high up in the bridge of the ship the captain stared out into the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation from where he reclined beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and above them the vast panorama of stars through which they were moving ʹ a panorama that had thinned out noticably during the course of the voyage turning and looking backwards over the vast two ­‐mile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them which seemed to form almost a solid band this was the view through the galactic centre from which they were travelling and indeed had been travelling for years at a speed that h e couldnt quite remember at the moment but he knew it was terribly fast it was something approaching the speed of something or other or was it three times the speed of something else jolly impressive anyway he peered into the bright distance behind t he ship looking for something he did this every few minutes or so but never found what he was looking for he didnt let it worry him though the scientist chaps had been very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion he wasnt panicking as far as he was concerned everything was going splendidly he dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge it crept back into his mind that he was feeling m ildly irritated about something now what was all that about a slight cough alerted him to the fact that the ships first officer was still standing nearby nice chap number one not of the very brightest had the odd spot of difficulty doing up his sho e laces but jolly good officer material for all that the captain wasnt a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces however long it took him not like that ghastly number two strutting about all over the place polishin g his buttons issuing reports every hour ships still moving captain still on course captain oxygen levels still being maintained captain give it a miss was the captains vote ah yes that was the thing that had been irritating him he pe ered down at number one yes captain he was shouting something or other about having found some prisoners the captain thought about this seemed pretty unlikely to him but he wasnt one to stand in his officers way well perhaps thatll keep him happy for a bit he said hes always wanted some ford prefect and arthur dent trudged onwards up the ships apparently endless corridors number two marched behind them barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or trying any funny stuff they seemed to have passed at least a mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave finally they reached a large steel door which slid open when number two shouted at it they entered to the eyes of ford prefect and arthur dent the most rem arkable thing about the ships bridge was not the fifty foot diameter hemispherical dome which covered it and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down on them to people who have eaten at the restaurant at the end of the universe such wonde rs are commonplace nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that crowded the long circumferential wall around them to arthur this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like and to ford it looked thoroughly antiquated it confirmed his suspicions that disaster areas stuntship had taken them back at least a million if not two million years before their own time no the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath the bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rou gh hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the maximegalon museum of diseased imaginings an intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave the taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump as the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that number two approached it captain sir he shouted through clenched teeth ʹ a difficult trick but hed had years during which to perfect it a large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim of the monstrous bath ah hello number two said the captain waving a cheery sponge having a nice day number two snapped even further to attention than he already was i have brought you the prisoners i located in freezer bay seven sir he yapped ford and arthur coughed in confusion er hello they said the captain beame d at them so number two had really found some prisoners well good for him thought the captain nice to see a chap doing what hes best at oh hello there he said to them excuse me not getting up having a quick bath well jynnan tonnyx all roun d then look in the fridge number one certainly sir it is a curious fact and one to which no one knows quite how much importance to attach that something like of all known worlds in the galaxy be they primitive or highly advanced have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx or gee ­‐nn­‐tn­‐ix or jino nd­‐o­‐nicks or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme the drinks themselves are not the same and vary between the sivolvian chinantomnigs which is ordinary water server at slightly above room temperature and the gagrakack an tzjin ­‐anthony ­‐ks which kills cows at a hundred paces and in fact the one common factor between all of them beyond the fact that the names sound the same is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any othe r worlds what can be made of this fact it exists in total isolation as far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph and yet it persists old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go o n about it young structural linguists get deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound importance and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time getting very angry with the young ones structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in ouisghian zodahs number two stood before the captains bathtub trembling with frust ration dont you want to interrogate the prisoners sir he squealed the captain peered at him in bemusement why on golgafrincham should i want to do that he asked to get information out of them sir to find out why they came here oh no no no said the captain i expect they just dropped in for a quick jynnan tonnyx dont you but sir theyre my prisoners i must interrogate them the captain looked at them doubtfully oh all right he said if you must ask them what they w ant to drink a hard cold gleam came into number twos eyes he advanced slowly on ford prefect and arthur dent all right you scum he growled you vermin he jabbed ford with the kill ­‐o­‐zap gun steady on number two admonished the captain gently what do you want to drink number two screamed well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me said ford what about you arthur arthur blinked what oh er yes he said with ice or without bellowed number two oh with please said ford lemon yes please said ford and do you have any of those little biscuits you know the cheesy ones im asking the questions howled number two his body quaking with apoplectic fury er number two s aid the captain softly sir push off would you theres a good chap im trying to have a relaxing bath number twos eyes narrowed and became what are known in the shouting and killing people trade as cold slits the idea presumably being to giv e your opponent the impression that you have lost your glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake why this is frightening is an as yet unresolved problem he advanced on the captain his number twos mouth a thin hard line again tricky to know why this is understood as fighting behaviour if whilst wandering through the jungle of traal you were suddenly to come upon the fabled ravenous bugblatter beast you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line rather than as it u sually is a gaping mass of slavering fangs may i remind you sir hissed number two at the captain that you have now been in that bath for over three years this final shot delivered number two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to pract ise darting eye movements in the mirror the captain squirmed in his bath he gave ford prefect a lame smile well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine he said ford slowly lowered his hands it provoked no reaction arthur lowered his treading very slowly and carefully ford moved over to the bath pedestal he patted it nice he lied he wondered if it was safe to grin very slowly and carefully he grinned it was safe er he said to the captain yes said the captain i wonder said ford could i ask you actually what your job is in fact a hand tapped him on the shoulder he span round it was the first officer your drinks he said ah thank you said ford he and arthur took their jynnan tonnyx arthur si pped his and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a whisky and soda i mean i couldnt help noticing said ford also taking a sip the bodies in the hold bodies said the captain in surprise ford paused and thought to himself never take anything for granted he thought could it be that the captain doesnt know hes got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship the captain was nodding cheerfully at him he also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck ford looked around number t wo was staring at him in the mirror but only for an instant his eyes were constantly on the move the first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling benignly bodies said the captain again ford licked his lips yes he said all those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives you know down in the hold the captain stared at him suddenly he threw back his head and laughed oh theyre not dead he said good lord no no theyre frozen theyre going to be revived ford did something he very rarely did he blinked arthur seemed to come out of a trance you mean youve got a hold full of frozen hairdressers he said oh yes said the captain millions of them hairdressers tired tv producers ins urance salesmen personnel officers security guards public relations executives management consultants you name them were going to colonize another planet ford wobbled very slightly exciting isnt it said the captain what with that lot said arthur ah now dont misunderstand me said the captain were just one of the ships in the ark fleet were the b ark you see sorry could i just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me arthur obliged and a casca de of pink frothy water swirled around the bath the captain let out a sigh of pleasure thank you so much my dear fellow do help yourselves to more drinks of course ford tossed down his drink took the bottle from the first officers tray and refilled his glass to the top what he said is a b ark this is said the captain and swished the foamy water around joyfully with the duck yes said ford but well what happened you see was said the captain our planet the world from which we have come was so to speak doomed doomed oh yes so what everyone thought was lets pack the whole population into some giant spaceships and go and set tle on another planet having told this much of his story he settled back with a satisfied grunt you mean a less doomed one promoted arthur what did you say dear fellow a less doomed planet you were going to settle on are going to settl e on yes so it was decided to build three ships you see three arks in space and im not boring you am i no no said ford firmly its fascinating you know its delightful reflected the captain to have someone else to talk to for a ch ange number twos eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled back on the mirror like a pair of flies briefly distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat trouble with a long journey like this continued the captain is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot which gets terribly boring because half the time you know what youre going to say next only half the time asked arthur in surprise the captain thought for a moment yes about half id say anyway ʹ wheres the soap he fished around and found it yes so anyway he resumed the idea was that into the first ship the a ship would go all the brilliant leaders the scientists the great artists you know all the achievers and into the third or c ship would go all the people who did the actual work who made things and did things and then into the b ship ʹ thats us ʹ would go everyone else the middlemen you see he smiled happily at them and we were sent off first he concluded and hummed a little bathing tune the little bathing tune which had been composed for him by one of his worlds most exciting and prolific jingle writer who was currently asleep in hold thirty ­‐six some nine hundred yards behind them covered what woul d otherwise have been an awkward moment of silence ford and arthur shuffled their feet and furiously avoided each others eyes er said arthur after a moment what exactly was it that was wrong with your planet then oh it was doomed as i said said the captain apparently it was going to crash into the sun or something or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us something of the kind absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was oh said the first officer suddenly i thought it was that the planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot piranha bees wasnt that it number two span around eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that only comes with the amount o f practise he was prepared to put in thats not what i was told he hissed my commanding officer told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten by an enormous mutant star goat oh really said ford prefect yes a monstr ous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth ten thousand miles long breath that would boil oceans claws that could tear continents from their roots a thousand eyes that burned like the sun slavering jaws a million miles across a monster such as you have never never ever and they made sure they sent you lot off first did they inquired arthur oh yes said the captain well everyone said very nicely i thought that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut and where the phones were clean oh yes agreed ford i can see that would be very important and the other ships er they followed on after you did they for a moment the captain did not answer he twisted round in his bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic centre he squinted into the inconceivable distance ah well its funny you should say that he said and allowed himself a slight f rown at ford prefect because curiously enough we havent heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago but they must be behind us somewhere he peered off into the distance again ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown unless o f course he said softly they were eaten by the goat ah yes said the captain with a slight hesitancy creeping into his voice the goat his eyes passed over the solid shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge they wink ed away innocently at him he stared out at the stars but none of them said a word he glanced at his first and second officers but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a moment he glanced at ford prefect who raised his eyebrows at him its a f unny thing you know said the captain at last but now that i actually come to tell the story to someone else i mean does it strike you as odd number two errrrrrrrrrrr said number two well said ford i can see that youve got a lot of things youre going to talk about so thanks for the drinks and if you could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet ah well thats a little difficult you see said the captain because our trajectory thingy was preset before we left golgafrincham i think partly because im not very good with figures you mean were stuck here on this ship exclaimed ford suddenly losing patience with the whole charade when are you meant to be reaching this planet youre meant to be colonizing oh were nearly there i think said the captain any second now its probably time i was getting out of this bath in fact oh i dont know though why stop just when im enjoying it so were actually going to land in a minute well not so much land in fact not actually land as such no er what are you talking about said ford sharply well said the captain picking his way through the words carefully i think as far a s i can remember we were programmed to crash on it crash shouted ford and arthur er yes said the captain yes its all part of the plan i think there was a terribly good reason for it which i cant quite remember at the moment it was someth ing to with er ford exploded youre a load of useless bloody loonies he shouted ah yes that was it beamed the captain that was the reason chapter the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy has this to say about the planet of golgafrincham it is a planet with an ancient and mysterious history rich in legend red and occasionally green with the blood of those who sought in times gone by to conquer her a land of parched and barren landscapes of sweet and sultry air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musty lichens beneath a land of fevered brows and intoxicated imaginings parti cularly amongst those who taste the lichens a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath a land also of steel and blood and heroism a land of the body and of the spirit thi s was its history and in all this ancient and mysterious history the most mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the great circling poets of arium these circling poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait f or small bands of unwary travellers circle round them and throw rocks at them and when the travellers cried out saying why didnt they go away and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock ­‐throwing business they wo uld suddenly stop and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninety ­‐four great song cycles of vassilian these songs were all of extraordinary beauty and even more extraordinary length and all fell into exactly the same pattern the first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the city of vassilian a party of five sage princes with four horses the princes who are of course brave noble and wise travel widely in distant lands fought giant ogres pursue exotic philosophies take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished the second and much longer part of each song would then tell of all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back all this lay in the planets remote past it was however a descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom which enabled th e people of golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population the other two ­‐thirds stayed firmly at home and lived full rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone chapter that night the ship crash ­‐landed on to an utterly insignificant little green ­‐blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy in the hours preceding the crash ford prefect had fought furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre ­‐ordained flight path it had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had been programmed to convey its payload safely i n uncomfortably to its new home but to cripple itself beyond repair in the process its screaming blazing descent through the atmosphere had stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding and its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky sw amp had left its crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep ­‐ frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to settle almost at once slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime once or twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors ʹ the detritus of its descent ʹ flashed across the sky in the grey pre ­‐dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and sank for ever into the stinking depths when the sun came up that morn ing it shed its thin watery light over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers public relations executives opinion pollsters and the rest all clawing their way desperately to dry land a less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight ba ck down again but it continued to climb its way through the sky and after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures countless numbers had unsurprisingly been lost to the swamp in the night and millions more had been sucked down with the ship but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside each looking for a few square feet of solid ground on whi ch to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal two figures moved further afield from a nearby hillside ford prefect and arthur dent watched the horror of which they could not feel a part filthy dirty trick to pull muttered arthur ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged an imaginative solution to a problem id have thought he said why cant people just learn to live together in peace and harmony said arthur ford gave a loud very hollow laugh forty ­‐two he said with a malicious grin no doesnt work never mind arthur looked at him as if hed gone mad and seeing nothing to indicate the contrary realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened what do you thin k will happen to them all he said after a while in an infinite universe anything can happen said ford even survival strange but true a curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the landscape and then settles again on the scene of mis ery below them i think theyll manage for a while he said arthur looked up sharply why do you say that he said ford shrugged just a hunch he said and refused to be drawn to any further questions look he said suddenly arthur follo wed his pointing finger down amongst the sprawling masses a figure was moving ʹ or perhaps lurching would be a more accurate description he appeared to be carrying something on his shoulder as he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he seemed t o wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken fashion after a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him movie camera said ford recording the historic movement well i dont know about you said ford again after a moment but im off he sat a while in silence after a while this seemed to require comment er when you say youre off what do you mean exactly said arthur good question said ford im gettin g total silence looking over his shoulder arthur saw that he was twiddling with knobs on a small box ford had already introduced this box as a sub ­‐ etha sens ­‐o­‐matic but arthur had merely nodded absently and not pursued the matter in his mind the univ erse still divided into two parts ʹ the earth and everything else the earth having been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass meant that this view of things was a little lopsided but arthur tended to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home sub­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐matics belonged firmly in the everything else category not a sausage said ford shaking the thing sausage thought arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the primitive world about him wha t i wouldnt give for a good earth sausage would you believe said ford in exasperation that there are no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted tip are you listening to me what said arthur were in trouble said fo rd oh said arthur this sounded like month ­‐old news to him until we pick up anything on this machine said ford our chances of getting off this planet are zero it may be some freak standing wave effect in the planets magnetic field ʹ in which case we just travel round and round till we find a clear reception area coming he picked up his gear and strode off arthur looked down the hill the man with the movie camera had struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his colleagues collapsing arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after ford chapter i trust you had a pleasant meal said zarniwoop to zaphod and trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship heart of gold and lay panting on the floor zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him you he spat he staggered to his fee t and stomped off to find a chair to slump into he found one and slumped into it i have programmed the computer with the improbability coordinates pertinent to our journey said zarniwoop we will arrive there very shortly meanwhile why dont you r elax and prepare yourself for the meeting zaphod said nothing he got up again and marched over to a small cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old janx spirit he took a long pull at it and when this is all done said zaphod savagely its don e alright im free to go and do what the hell i like and lie on beaches and stuff it depends what transpires from the meeting said zarniwoop zaphod who is this man said trillian shakily wobbling to her feet whats he doing here whys he o n our ship hes a very stupid man said zaphod who wants to meet the man who rules the universe ah said trillian taking the bottle from zaphod and helping herself a social climber chapter the major problem ʹ one of the major prob lems for there are several ʹ one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them to summarize it is a well known fact that those people who most want to rule people are ipso facto those least suited to do it to summarize the summary anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job to summarize the summary of the summary people are a problem and so this is the situation we find a succession of galactic presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that theyre not and so mewhere in the shadows behind them ʹ who who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to chapter on a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular ʹ nowhere that is that could ever be found since it is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this galaxy have a key ʹ it was raining it was bucketing down and had been for hours it beat the top of the sea into a mist it pounded the trees it churned and slopped a stret ch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath the rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land it obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to the se ashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there the noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within but went largely unnoticed by its occupant whose attention was otherwise engaged he was a ta ll shambling man with rough straw ­‐coloured hair that was damp from the leaking roof his clothes were shabby his back was hunched and his eyes though open seemed closed in his shack was an old beaten ­‐up armchair an old scratched table an old mattre ss some cushions and a stove that was small but warm there was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat and this was currently the focus of the mans attention he bent his shambling form over it pussy pussy pussy he said coochicoochicoochic oo pussy want his fish nice piece of fish pussy want it the cat seemed undecided on the matter it pawed rather condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out and then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor pussy not eat his fish pussy get thin and waste away i think said the man doubt crept into his voice i imagine this is what will happen he said but how can i tell he proffered the fish again pussy think he said eat fish or not eat fish i think it is better if i dont get involved he sighed i think fish is nice but then i think that rain is wet so who am i to judge he left the fish on the floor for the cat and retired to his se at ah i seem to see you eating it he said at last as the cat exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and pounced on to the fish i like it when i see you eat the fish said the man because in my mind you will waste away i f you dont he picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a pencil he held one in one hand and the other in the other and experimented with the different ways of bringing them together he tried holding the pencil under the paper then over the paper then next to the paper he tried wrapping the paper round the pencil he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper it made a mark and he was delighted with the di scovery as he was every day he picked up another piece of paper from the table this had a crossword on it he studied it briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest he tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the feel of the bones of his hip fish come from far away he said or so im told or so i imagine im told when the men come or when in my mind the men come in their six black ships do they come in your mind too what do you see pussy he looked at the c at which was more concerned with getting the fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations and when i hear their questions do you hear questions what do their voices mean to you perhaps you just think theyre singing songs to you he reflected on this and saw the flaw in the supposition perhaps they are singing songs to you he said and i just think theyre asking me questions he paused again sometimes he would pause for days just to see what it was like do you think they came today he said i do theres mud on the floor cigarettes and whisky on the table fish on a plate for you and a memory of them in my mind hardly conclusive evidence i know but then all evidence is circumstantial and look what else th eyve left me he reached over to the table and pulled some things off it crosswords dictionaries and a calculator he played with the calculator for an hour whilst the cat went to sleep and the rain outside continued to pour eventually he put t he calculator aside i think i must be right in thinking they ask me questions he said to come all that way and leave all these things for the privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour or so it seems to me who can tell who can tell from the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from the stove he inhaled deeply and sat back i think i saw another ship in the sky today he said at last a big white one ive never seen a big white one just the six bla ck ones and the six green ones and the others who say they come from so far away never a big white one perhaps six small black ones can look like one big white one at certain times perhaps i would like a glass of whisky yes that seems more likely he stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the mattress he poured in a measure from his whisky bottle he sat again perhaps some other people are coming to see me he said a hundred yards away pelted by the torrential rain lay the heart of gold its hatchway opened and three figures emerged huddling into themselves to keep the rain off their faces in there shouted trillian above the noise of the rain yes said zarniwoop that shack yes weird said zaphod but its in the middle of nowhere said trillian we must have come to the wrong place you cant rule the universe from a shack they hurried through the pouring rain and arrived wet through at the door they knocked they shivered the door ope ned hello said the man ah excuse me said zarniwoop i have reason to believe do you rule the universe said zaphod the man smiled at him i try not to he said are you wet zaphod looked at him in astonishment wet he cried doesnt it look as if were wet thats how it looks to me said the man but how you feel about it might be an altogether different matter if you feel warmth makes you dry youd better come in they went in they looked around the tiny shack zarniwoop with slight distaste trillian with interest zaphod with delight hey er said zaphod whats your name the man looked at them doubtfully i dont know why do you think i should have one it seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name he invited trillian to sit in the chair he sat on the edge of the chair zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and zaphod lay on the mattress wowee said zaphod the seat of power he tickled the cat listen said zarniwoop i must ask you some questions alright said the man kindly you can sing to my cat if you like would he like that asked zaphod youd better ask him said the man does he talk said zaphod i have no memory of him talking said the man but i am very unreliable zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket now he said you do rule the universe do you how can i tell said the man zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper how long have you been doing this ah said the man this is a question about the past is it zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement this wasnt exactly what he had been expecting yes he said how ca n i tell said the man that the past isnt a fiction designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind zarniwoop stared at him the steam began to rise from his sodden clothes so you answer all questions like this he said the man answered quickly i say what it occurs to me to say when i think i hear people say things more i cannot say zaphod laughed happily ill drink to that he said and pulled out the bottle of janx spirit he leaped up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the universe who took it with pleasure good on you great ruler he said tell it like it is no listen to me said zarniwoop people come to you do they in ships i think s o said the man he handed the bottle to trillian and they ask you said zarniwoop to take decisions for them about peoples lives about worlds about economies about wars about everything going on out there in the universe out there said the man out where out there said zarniwoop pointing at the door how can you tell theres anything out there said the man politely the doors closed the rain continued to pound the roof inside the shack it was warm but you know theres a whole universe out there cried zarniwoop you cant dodge your responsibilities by saying they dont exist the ruler of the universe thought for a long while whilst zarniwoop quivered with anger youre very sure of your facts he said at last i couldnt trust the thinking of a man who takes the universe ʹ if there is one ʹ for granted zarniwoop still quivered but was silent i only decide about my universe continued the man quietly my universe is my eyes and my ears anything else i s hearsay but dont you believe in anything the man shrugged and picked up his cat i dont understand what you mean he said you dont understand that what you decide in this shack of yours affects the lives and fates of millions of people t his is all monstrously wrong i dont know ive never met all these people you speak of and neither i suspect have you they only exist in words we hear it is folly to say you know what is happening to other people only they know if they exist t hey have their own universes of their own eyes and ears trillian said i think im just popping outside for a moment she left and walked into the rain do you believe other people exist insisted zarniwoop i have no opinion how can i say id better see whats up with trillian said zaphod and slipped out outside he said to her i think the universe is in pretty good hands yeah very good said trillian they walked off into the rain inside zarniwoop continued but dont yo u understand that people live or die on your word the ruler of the universe waited for as long as he could when he heard the faint sound of the ships engines starting he spoke to cover it its nothing to do with me he said i am not involved wit h people the lord knows i am not a cruel man ah barked zarniwoop you say the lord you believe in something my cat said the man benignly picking it up and stroking it i call him the lord i am kind to him alright said zarniwoop p ressing home his point how do you know he exists how do you know he knows you to be kind or enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness i dont said the man with a smile i have no idea it merely pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appe ars to be a cat do you behave any differently please i think i am tired zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about where are the other two he said suddenly what other two said the ruler of the universe settling back i nto his chair and refilling his whisky glass beeblebrox and the girl the two who were here i remember no one the past is a fiction to account for stuff it snapped zarniwoop and ran out into the rain there was no ship the rain continued t o churn the mud there was no sign to show where the ship had been he hollered into the rain he turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked the ruler of the universe dozed lightly in his chair after a while he played with the pencil and the p aper again and was delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other various noises continued outside but he didnt know whether they were real or not he then talked to his table for a week to see how it would react chapter the stars came out that night dazzling in their brilliance and clarity ford and arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of judging and finally stopped to rest the night was cool and balmy the air pure the sub ­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐matic total ly silent a wonderful stillness hung over the world a magical calm which combined with the soft fragrances of the woods the quiet chatter of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits even ford prefect who had seen m ore worlds than he could count on a long afternoon was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful he had ever seen all that day they had passed through rolling green hills and valleys richly covered with grasses wild scented flowers and tall thickl y leaved trees the sun had warmed them light breezes had kept them cool and ford prefect had checked his sub ­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐ matic at less and less frequent intervals and had exhibited less and less annoyance at its continued silence he was beginning to t hink he liked it here cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling refreshed but hungry ford had stuffed some small rolls into his satchel at milliways and they breakfasted off those bef ore moving on so far they had wandered purely at random but now they struck out firmly eastwards feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from and where they were going shortly befo re noon they had their first indication that the world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one a half glimpsed face amongst the trees watching them it vanished at the moment they both saw it but the image they were both left with was of a humanoi d creature curious to see them but not alarmed half an hour later they glimpsed another such face and ten minutes after that another a minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped short before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about two dozen men and women they stood still and quiet facing ford and arthur around some of the women huddled some small children and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches ford and arthur held their breath the tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high they all stooped forward slightly had longish arms and lowish foreheads and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers seeing that they carried no weapon s and made no move towards them ford and arthur relaxed slightly for a while the two groups simply stared at each other neither side making any move the natives seemed puzzled by the intruders and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were qu ite clearly not issuing any invitations for a full two minutes nothing continued to happen after two minutes ford decided it was time something happened hello he said the women drew their children slightly closer to them the men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome ʹ it was not resented in any great degree it was just not welcome one of the men who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the group and wh o might therefore have been their leader stepped forward his face was quiet and calm almost serene ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh he said quietly this caught arthur by surprise he had grown so used to receiving an instantaneous and unconscio us translation of everything he heard via the babel fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didnt seem to be working vague shadows of meaning had flickered at the back of his mind but there was nothing he could get any firm grasp on he guessed correctly as it happens that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language and that the babel fish was therefore powerless to help he glanced at ford who was infinitely more experienced in these matters i think said ford out of the corner of his mouth hes asking us if wed mind walking on round the edge of the village a moment later a gesture from the man ­‐creature seemed to confirm this ruurgggghhhh urrgggh urgh urgh uh ruh rruurruuh ug continued the man ­‐creature the general gist said ford as far as i can make out is that we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like but if we would walk round his village rather than through it would make them all very happy so what do we do i think we make them happy said ford slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing this seemed to go down very well with the natives who bowed to t hem very slightly and then went about their business ford and arthur continued their journey through the wood a few hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in their path ʹ berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries and pulpy green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears so far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen though the trees and bushed were laden with them look at it this way ford prefect had said fruit and berries on strange planets either make you live or make you die therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when youre going to die if you dont that way you stay ahead the secret of healthy hitch ­‐hiking is to eat junk f ood they looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion it looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger look at it this way said ford er yes said arthur im trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it said ford the leaf ­‐dappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things which looked like pears the things which looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter and riper than any arthur had ever seen even in ice cream commercials why dont we eat them and think about it afterwards he said maybe thats what they want us to do alright look at it this way sounds good so far its there for us to eat ei ther its good or its bad either they want to feed us or to poison us if its poisonous and we dont eat it theyll just attack us some other way if we dont eat we lose out either way i like the way youre thinking said ford now eat one hesitantly arthur picked up one of those things that looked like pears i always thought that about the garden of eden story said ford eh garden of eden tree apple that bit remember yes of course i do your god person puts an apple tre e in the middle of a garden and says do what you like guys oh but dont eat the apple surprise surprise they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting gotcha it wouldnt have made any difference if they hadnt eaten it why not beca use if youre dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they wont give up theyll get you in the end what are you talking about never mind eat the fruit you know this place almost looks like the garden of eden eat the fruit sounds quite like it too arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear its a pear he said a few moments later when they had eaten the lot fo rd prefect turned round and called out thank you thank you very much he called youre very kind they went on their way for the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path and though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man ­‐creature amongst the trees they never again made direct contact th ey decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone the fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles because that was where the sea started having no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed the sea it was reasonably calm only about sixty miles wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing landing in a country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left life was in short ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them when the craving for company became too great they would know where to find it but for the moment they were happy to feel that the golgafrinchans we re hundreds of miles behind them nevertheless ford prefect began to use his sub ­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐matic more often again only once did he pick up a signal but that was so faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken on a whim they turned northwards after weeks of travelling they came to another sea built another raft and crossed it this time it was harder going the climate was getting colder arthur suspected a streak of masochi sm in ford prefect ʹ the increasing difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that was otherwise lacking he strode onwards relentlessly their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty the vast jagged snow covered peaks ravished their senses the cold began to bite into their bones they wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which ford prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex ­‐ pralite monks runn ing a mind ­‐surfing resort in the hills of hunian the galaxy is littered with ex ­‐pralite monks all on the make because the mental control techniques the order have evolved as a form of devotional discipline are frankly sensational ʹ and extraordinary numbers of monks leave the order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives fords technique seemed to consist mainly of standing stil l for a while and smiling after a while an animal ʹ a deer perhaps ʹ would appear from out of the trees and watch him cautiously ford would continue to smile at it his eyes would soften and shine and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love a love which reached out to embrace all of creation a wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding countryside peaceful and serene emanating from this transfigured man slowly the deer would approach step by step until it was almost nuzzling him whereupon ford prefect would reach out to it and break its neck pheromone control he said it was you just have to know how to generate the right smell chapter a few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a coastline wh ich swept diagonally before them from the south ­‐west to the north ­‐east a coastline of monumental grandeur deep majestic ravines soaring pinnacles of ice ­‐fjords for two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks and glaciers awe ­‐struck wit h beauty arthur yelled ford suddenly it was the afternoon of the second day arthur was sitting on a high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy promontories arthur yelled ford again arthur looked to where fords voice had come from carried faintly in the wind ford had gone to examine a glacier and arthur found him there crouching by the solid wall of blue ice he was tense with excitement ʹ his eyes darted up to meet arthurs look he said look arthur looked he saw the solid wall of blue ice yes he said its a glacier ive already seen it no said ford youve looked at it you havent seen it look ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice arthur peered ʹ he saw nothing but vague shadows move back from it insisted ford look again arthur moved back and looked again no he said and shrugged what am i supposed to be looking for and suddenly he saw it you see it he saw it his mouth started to speak but his brain decided it hadnt got anything to say yet and shut it again his brain then started to contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again once more gathering up the jaw his brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion for a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth and simultaneousl y tried to think about what was buried in the ice which is probably why the legs went and arthur dropped restfully to the ground the thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shadows in the ice about eighteen inches beneath the surface looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet each about three feet high and for those like arthur who couldnt read magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face hangin g in the ice it was an old face thin and distinguished careworn but not unkind it was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on chapter a thin whine filled the air it w hirled and howled through the trees upsetting the squirrels a few birds flew off in disgust the noise danced and skittered round the clearing it whooped it rasped it generally offended the captain however regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulge nt eye little could disturb his equanimity indeed once he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial a hollow had been scooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him not particularly warm water it must be said as they hadnt yet worked out a way of heating it never mind that would come an d in the meantime search parties were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring preferably one in a nice leafy glade and if it was near a soap mine ʹ perfection to those who said that they had a feeling soap wasnt found in mines the capta in had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough and this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged no life was very pleasant and the greatest thing about it was that when the hot spring was found complete wi th leafy glade en suite and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap mine had been located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be more pleasant still it was very important to have things to lo ok forward to wail wail screech wail howl honk squeak went the bagpipes increasing the captains already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop that was something he looked forward to as well what else was plea sant he asked himself well so many things the red and gold of the trees now that autumn was approaching the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and his assistant the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock ­‐hewn bath the only thing nicer than a phone that didnt ring all the time or indeed at all was six phones that didnt ring all the time or indeed at all nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting the captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak the afternoon committee meetings were his favourite other eyes watched the assembling crowds high in a tree on the edge of the clearing squatted ford prefect lately returned from foreign climes after his six month journey he was lean and healthy his eyes gleamed he wore a reindeer ­‐skin coat his beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a country ­‐rock singers he and arthur dent had been watching the golgafrinchans for almost a week now and ford had decided to stir things up a bit the clearing was now full hundreds of men and women lounged around chatting eating fruit playing cards and generally having a fairly relaxed time of it their track suits were now all dirty and even torn but they all had immaculately styled hair ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their track su its full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the coming winter fords eyes narrowed they couldnt be interested in botany of a sudden could they in the middle of these speculations the captains voice rose abo ve the hubbub alright he said id like to call this meeting to some sort of order if thats at all possible is that alright with everybody he smiled genially in a minute when youre all ready the talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own a few of those in his immediate vicinity threw some leaves to him if there was any reason for this then it escaped ford prefect for the moment a small group of people had clustered round the captain and one of them was clearly beginning to speak he did this by standing up clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a mi nute the crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him a moment of silence followed which ford judged to be the right dramatic moment to make his entry the man turned to speak ford dropped down out of the tree hi there he said the crowd swivelled round ah my dear fellow called out the captain got any matches on you or a lighter anything like that no said ford sounding a little deflated it wasnt what hed prepared he decided hed better be a little stronger o n the subject no i havent he continued no matches instead i bring you news pity said the captain weve all run out you see havent had a hot bath in weeks ford refused to be headed off i bring you news he said of a discovery t hat might interest you is it on the agenda snapped the man whom ford had interrupted ford smiled a broad country ­‐rock singer smile now come on he said well im sorry said the man huffily but speaking as a management consultant of many years standing i must insist on the importance of observing the committee structure ford looked round the crowd hes mad you know he said this is a prehist oric planet address the chair snapped the management consultant there isnt chair explained ford theres only a rock the management consultant decided that testiness was what the situation now called for well call it a chair he said testily why not call it a rock asked ford you obviously have no conception said the management consultant not abandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned hauteur of modern business methods and you have no conception of where you are said ford a girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it shut up you two she said i want to table a motion you mean boulder a motion tittered a hairdresser order order yapped the manag ement consultant alright said ford lets see how you are doing he plonked himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his temper the captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise i would like to call to order he said pl easantly the five hundred and seventy ­‐third meeting of the colonization committee of fintlewoodlewix ten seconds thought ford as he leapt to his feet again this is futile he exclaimed five hundred and seventy ­‐three committee meetings and you havent even discovered fire yet if you would care said the girl with the strident voice to examine the agenda sheet agenda rock trilled the hairdresser happily thank you ive made that point muttered ford you will see continued the girl firmly that we are having a report from the hairdressers fire development sub ­‐committee today oh ah ʹ said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is recognized the whole galaxy over as meaning er will next tuesday do alright said ford rounding on him what have you done what are you going to do what are your thoughts on fire development well i dont know said the hairdresser all they gave me was a couple of sticks so what have you done with the m nervously the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed over the fruits of his labour to ford ford held them up for all to see curling tongs he said the crowd applauded never mind said ford rome wasnt burnt in a day the crowd hadnt the faintest idea what he was talking about but they loved it nevertheless they applauded well youre obviously being totally naive of course said the girl when youve been in marketing as long as i have youll know that before any n ew product can be developed it has to be properly researched weve got to find out what people want from fire how they relate to it what sort of image it has for them the crowd were tense they were expecting something wonderful from ford stick it up your nose he said which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know insisted the girl do people want fire that can be applied nasally do you ford asked the crowd yes shouted some no shouted others happily they did nt know they just thought it was great and the wheel said the captain what about this wheel thingy it sounds a terribly interesting project ah said the marketing girl well were having a little difficulty there difficulty exclaimed ford difficulty what do you mean difficulty its the single simplest machine in the entire universe the marketing girl soured him with a look alright mr wiseguy she said youre so clever you tell us what colour it should have the crowd went wild one up to the home team they thought ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again almighty zarquon he said have none of you done anything as if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from the entrance to the clearing the crowd couldnt believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of their golgafrincham rd regiment dress uniforms about half of th em still carried kill ­‐o­‐zap guns the rest now carried spears which they struck together as they marched they looked bronzed healthy and utterly exhausted and bedraggled they clattered to a halt and banged to attention one of them fell over and never moved again captain sir cried number two ʹ for he was their leader ʹ permission to report sir yes alright number two welcome back and all that find any hot springs said the captain despondently no sir thought you wouldnt number t wo strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath we have discovered another continent when was this it lies across the sea said number two narrowing his eyes significantly to the east ah number two turned to face the crowd he raised his gun above his head this is going to be great thought the crowd we have declared war on it wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing ʹ this was beyond all expectation wait a minute shouted ford prefec t wait a minute he leapt to his feet and demanded silence after a while he got it or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem do we have to have the piper demanded ford oh yes said the captain weve given him a grant ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly decided that that way madness lay instead he slung a well judged rock at the piper and turned to face number two war he said yes number two gazed contemptuously at ford prefect on th e next continent yes total warfare the war to end all wars but theres no one even living there yet ah interesting thought the crowd nice point number twos gaze hovered undisturbed in this respect his eyes were like a couple of mosquito s that hover purposefully three inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes fly swats or rolled newspapers i know that he said but there will be one day so we have left an open ­‐ended ultimatum what and blown up a few m ilitary installations the captain leaned forward out of his bath military installations number two he said for a moment the eyes wavered yes sir well potential military installations alright trees the moment of uncertainty passed ʹ his eyes flickered like whips over his audience and he roared we interrogated a gazelle he flipped his kill ­‐o­‐zap gun smartly under his arm and marched off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the ecstatic crowd a few steps was all he managed before he was caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the c learing ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together so what else have you done he inquired after the celebrations had died down we have started a culture said the marketing girl oh yes said ford yes one of our film producers i s already making a fascinating documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area theyre not cavemen they look like cavemen do they live in caves well they live in huts perhaps theyre having their caves redecorated called out a wag from the crowd ford rounded on him angrily very funny he said but have you noticed that theyre dying out on their journey back ford and arthur had come across two derelict vil lages and the bodies of many natives in the woods where they had crept away to die those that still lived were stricken and listless as if they were suffering some disease of the spirit rather than the body they moved sluggishly and with an infinite sa dness their future had been taken away from them dying out repeated ford do you know what that means er we shouldnt sell them any life insurance called out the wag again ford ignored him and appealed to the whole crowd can you try a nd understand he said that its just since weve arrived that theyve started dying out in fact that comes over terribly well in this film said the marketing girl and just gives it that poignant twist which is the hallmark of the really great d ocumentary the producers very committed he should be muttered ford i gather said the girl turning to address the captain who was beginning to nod off that he wants to make one about you next captain oh really he said coming to with a start thats awfully nice hes got a very strong angle on it you know the burden of responsibility the loneliness of command the captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment well i wouldnt overstress that angle you know he said finally ones never alone with a rubber duck he held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the crowd all the while the management consultant had been sitting in stony silence his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate that h e was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary at this point he decided he would not wait all day after all he would merely pretend that the last half hour hadnt happened he rose to his feet if he said tersely we could for a moment m ove on to the subject of fiscal policy fiscal policy whooped ford prefect fiscal policy the management consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish could have copied fiscal policy he repeated that is what i said how can you hav e money demanded ford if none of you actually produces anything it doesnt grow on trees you know if you would allow me to continue ford nodded dejectedly thank you since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender we ha ve of course all become immensely rich ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with which their track suits were stuffed but we have also continued the management c onsultant run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability which means that i gather the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ships peanut murmurs of alarm came from the crowd the management consultant waved them down so in order to obviate this problem he continued and effectively revaluate the leaf we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign and er burn down all t he forests i think youll all agree thats a sensible move under the circumstances the crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in their pockets whereu pon they let out whoops of delight and gave the management consultant a standing ovation the accountants amongst them looked forward to a profitable autumn youre all mad explained ford prefect youre absolutely barmy he suggested youre a bu nch of raving nutters he opined the tide of opinion started to turn against him what had started out as excellent entertainment had now in the crowds view deteriorated into mere abuse and since this abuse was in the main directed at them they wearied of it sensing this shift in th e wind the marketing girl turned on him is it perhaps in order she demanded to inquire what youve been doing all these months then you and that other interloper have been missing since the day we arrived weve been on a journey said ford we went to try and find out something about this planet oh said the girl archly doesnt sound very productive to me no well have i got news for you my love we have discovered this planets future ford waited for this statement to have its effect it didnt have any they didnt know what he was talking about he continued it doesnt matter a pair of fetid dingos kidneys what you all choose to do from now on burn down the forests anything it wont make a scrap of difference your fu ture history has already happened two million years youve got and thats it at the end of that time your race will be dead gone and good riddance to you remember that two million years the crowd muttered to itself in annoyance people as rich as t hey had suddenly become shouldnt be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away they didnt need to bother ford was already stalking out of the clearing pausing only to shake his he ad at number two who was already firing his kill ­‐o­‐zap gun into some neighbouring trees he turned back once two million years he said and laughed well said the captain with a soothing smile still time for a few more baths could someone pass me the sponge i just dropped it over the side chapter a mile or so away through the wood arthur dent was too busily engrossed with what he was doing to hear ford prefect approach what he was doing was rather curious and this is what it was on a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square subdivided into one hundred and sixty ­‐nine smaller squares thirteen to a side furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each sitting morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native men whom arthur dent was trying to introduce the curious concept embodied in these stones so far they had not done well they had attempted to eat some of them bury others and throw the rest of them away arthur had finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out which was not even as far as hed man aged to get the day before along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of these creatures there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence in an attempt to egg them along arthur set out a number of letters on the boar d himself and then tried to encourage the natives to add some more themselves it was not going well ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree no said arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled some of the letters round in a fit of ab ysmal dejection q scores ten you see and its on a triple word score so look ive explained the rules to you no no look please put down that jawbone alright well start again and try to concentrate this time ford leaned his elbow again st the tree and his hand against his head what are you doing arthur he asked quietly arthur looked up with a start he suddenly had a feeling that all this might look slightly foolish all he knew was that it had worked like a dream on him when he was a child but things were different then or rather would be im trying to teach the cavemen to play scrabble he said theyre not cavemen said ford they look like cavemen ford let it pass i see he said its uphill work said art hur wearily the only word they know is grunt and they cant spell it he sighed and sat back whats that supposed to achieve asked ford weve got to encourage them to evolve to develop arthur burst out angrily he hoped that the weary sigh a nd then the anger might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of foolishness from which he was currently suffering it didnt he jumped to his feet can you imagine what a world would be like descended from those cretins we arrived with he said imagine said ford rising his eyebrows we dont have to imagine weve seen it but arthur waved his arms about hopelessly weve seen it said ford theres no escape arthur kicked at a stone did you tell them what weve d iscovered he asked hmmmm said ford not really concentrating norway said arthur slartibartfasts signature in the glacier did you tell them whats the point said ford what would it mean to them mean said arthur mean you know perfectly well what it means it means that this planet is the earth its my home its where i was born was said ford alright will be yes in two million years time why dont you tell them that go and say to them excuse me id just like to point out that in two million years time i will be born just a few miles from here see what they say theyll chase you up a tree and set fi re to it arthur absorbed this unhappily face it said ford those zeebs over there are your ancestors not these poor creatures here he went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging listlessly with the stone letters he shook his head put the scrabble away arthur he said it wont save the human race because this lot arent going to be the human race the human race is currently sitting round a rock on the other side of this hill making documentaries about themselves arthur wi nced there must be something we can do he said a terrible sense of desolation thrilled through his body that he should be here on the earth the earth which had lost its future in a horrifying arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose i ts past as well no said ford theres nothing we can do this doesnt change the history of the earth you see this is the history of the earth like it or leave it the golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from in two million years they get destroyed by the vogons history is never altered you see it just fits together like a jigsaw funny old thing life isnt it he picked up the letter q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush where it hit a young rabbit the rabbit hurtled off in terror and didnt stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked on one of its bones and died on the bank of a stream which subsequently washed it away during the following weeks ford prefect swallowed his pride and struck up a relationship w ith a girl who had been a personnel officer on golgafrincham and he was terribly upset when she suddenly passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox the only moral it is possible to draw from thi s story is that one should never throw the letter q into a pivet bush but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable like most of the really crucial things in life this chain of events was completely invisible to ford prefect and arthur dent they were looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing the other letters around poor bloody caveman said arthur theyre not what oh never mind the wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged on the rock its all been a bit of waste of time for them hasnt it said arthur uh uh urghhhhh muttered the native and banged on the rock again theyve been outevolved by telephone sanitizers urgh gr gr gruh insisted the native continuing to bang on the rock why does he keep banging on the rock said arthur i think he probably wants you to scrabble with him again said ford hes pointing at the letters probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again poor bastard i keep on telling him theres only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc the native banged on the rock again they looked over his shoulder their eyes popped there amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid out in a clear straight line they spelt two words the words were thes e forty ­‐two grrrurgh guh guh explained the native he swept the letters angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his colleague ford and arthur stared at him then they stared at each other did that say what i thought it said they both said to each other yes they both said forty ­‐two said arthur forty ­‐two said ford arthur ran over to the two natives what are you trying to tell us he shouted whats it supposed to mean one of them rolled over on the ground kicked his legs up in the air rolled over again and went to sleep the other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at ford prefect whatever it was they had to say they had already said it you know w hat this means said ford not entirely forty ­‐two is the number deep thought gave as being the ultimate answer yes and the earth is the computer deep thought designed and built to calculate the question to the ultimate answer so we are led to believe and organic life was part of the computer matrix if you say so i do say so that means that these natives these apemen are an integral part of the computer program and that we and the golgafrinchans are not but t he cavemen are dying out and the golgafrinchans are obviously set to replace them exactly so do you see what this means what cock up said ford prefect arthur looked around him this planet is having a pretty bloody time of it he said ford puzzled for a moment still something must have come out of it he said at last because marvin said he could see the question printed in your brain wave patterns but probably the wrong one or a distortion of the right one it might give us a clue though if we could find it i dont see how we can though they moped about for a bit arthur sat on the ground and started pulling up bits of grass but found that it was nt an occupation he could get deeply engrossed in it wasnt grass he could believe in the trees seemed pointless the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to be crawled through ford fiddled with his sub ­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐matic it was silent he sighed and put it away arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home ­‐made scrabble set it was a t he sighed and out it down again the letter he put down next to it was an i that spelt it he tossed another couple of letters next to them they were an s and an h as it happened by a curious coincidence the resulting word perfectly expressed the way arthur was feeling about things just then he stared at it for a moment he hadnt done it deliberately it was j ust a random chance his brain got slowly into first gear ford he said suddenly look if that question is printed in my brain wave patterns but im not consciously aware of it it must be somewhere in my unconscious yes i suppose so there mi ght be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern forward oh yes yes by introducing some random element that can be shaped by that pattern like how like by pulling scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded ford leapt to his feet brilliant he said he tugged his towel out of his satchel and with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag totally mad he said utter nonsense but well do it because its brilliant nonsense come on come on the sun passed respectfully behind a cloud a few small sad raindrops fell they piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them into the bag they shook them up right said ford close your eyes pull them out come on come on come on arthur closed his eyes and plunged h is hand into the towelful of stones he jiggled them about pulled out four and handed them to ford ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them w said ford h a t what he blinked i think its working he said arthur pushed three more at him d o y doy oh perhaps it isnt working said ford heres the next three o u g doyoug its not making sense im afraid arthur pulled another two from the bag ford put them in place e t doyouget do you g et shouted ford it is working this is amazing it really is working more here arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as he could go i f said ford y o u m u l t i p l y what do you get if you multiply s i x six b y by six by what do you get if you multiply six by n i n e six by nine he paused come on wheres the next one er thats the lot said arthur thats all there were he sat back nonplussed he rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no more letters you mean thats it said ford thats it six by nine forty ­‐two thats it thats all there is chapter the sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them a b ird sang a warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the flowers carrying their scent away through the woods an insect droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in the late afternoon the sound of voices lilted throu gh the trees followed a moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at the sight of ford prefect and arthur dent apparently lying on the ground in agony but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter no dont go called ford prefect between gasps well be with you in a moment whats the matter asked one of the girls she was the taller and slimmer of the two on golgafrincham she had been a junior personnel officer but hadnt liked it much ford pulled himself together excuse me he s aid hello my friend and i were just contemplating the meaning of life frivolous exercise oh its you said the girl you made a bit of a spectacle of yourself this afternoon you were quite funny to begin with but you did bang on a bit did i oh yes yes what was all that for asked the other girl a shorter round ­‐ faced girl who had been an art director for a small advertising company on golgafrincham whatever the privations of this world were she went to sleep every night profoundly gr ateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the morning it wouldnt be a hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste for for nothing nothings for anything said ford prefect happily come and join us im ford this is arthur we were just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait the girls looked at them doubtfully im agda said the tall one this is mella hello agda hello mella said ford do you talk at all said mella to arthur oh eventually said arthur with a smile but not as much as ford good there was a slight pause what did you mean asked agda about only having two million years i couldnt make sense of what you were saying oh that said ford it doesnt matter its just that the world gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass said arthur with a shrug but thats two million years away and anyway its just vogons doing what vogons do vogons said mel la yes you wouldnt know them whered you get this idea from it really doesnt matter its just like a dream from the past or the future arthur smiled and looked away does it worry you that you dont talk any kind of sense asked agda listen forget it said ford forget all of it nothing matters look its a beautiful day enjoy it the sun the green of the hills the river down in the valley the burning trees even if its only a dream its a pretty horrible idea said me lla destroying a world just to make a bypass oh ive heard of worse said ford i read of one planet off in the seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic bar billiards got potted straight into a black hole killed ten b illion people thats mad said mella yes only scored thirty points too agda and mella exchanged glances look said agda theres a party after the committee meeting tonight you can come along if you like yeah ok said ford id li ke to said arthur many hours later arthur and mella sat and watched the moon rise over the dull red glow of the trees that story about the world being destroyed began mella in two million years yes you say it as if you really think its true yes i think it is i think i was there she shook her head in puzzlement youre very strange she said no im very ordinary said arthur but some very strange things have happened to me you co uld say im more differed from than differing and that other world your friend talked about the one that got pushed into a black hole ah that i dont know about it sounds like something from the book what book arthur paused the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy he said at last whats that oh just something i threw into the river this evening i dont think ill be wanting it any more said arthur dent douglas adams life the universe and everything for sa lly chapter the regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of arthur dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was it wasnt just that the cave was cold it wasnt just that it was damp and smelly it was the fact that the cave wa s in the middle of islington and there wasnt a bus due for two million years time is the worst place so to speak to get lost in as arthur dent could testify having been lost in both time and space a good deal at least being lost in space kept you b usy he was stranded in prehistoric earth as the result of a complex sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the galaxy than he ever dreamt existed and though his life had now turned ve ry very very quiet he was still feeling jumpy he hadnt been blown up now for five years since he had hardly seen anyone since he and ford prefect had parted company four years previously he hadnt been insulted in all that time either except jus t once it had happened on a spring evening about two years previously he was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds he turned and stared with hope suddenly clambering through his heart rescue escape the castaways impossible dream ʹ a ship and as he watched as he stared in wonder and excitement a long silver ship descended through the warm evening air quietly without fuss its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology it alighted gently on the ground and what little hum it had generated died away as if lulled by the evening calm a ramp extended itself light streamed out a tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway it walked down the ramp and stood in front of arthur youre a jerk dent it said simply it was alien very alien it had a peculiar alien tallness a peculiar alien flattened head peculiar slitty little alien eyes extravagantly draped golden ropes with a peculiarly alien collar design and pale grey­‐green alien skin which had about it that lustrous shine which most grey ­‐green faces can only acquire with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap arthur boggled at it it gazed levelly at him arthurs first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been overwhelmed by astonishment and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use of his vocal chords at this moment whh he said bu hu uh he added ru ra wah who he managed finally to say and lapsed into a frantic kind of silence he was feeling the e ffects of having not said anything to anybody for as long as he could remember the alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand arthur dent it said arthur nodded helplessly arthur philip dent pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap er er yes er er confirmed arthur youre a jerk repeated the alien a complete asshole er the creature nodded to itself made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship er said arthur desperately er dont give me that snapped the alien it marched up the ramp through the hatchway and disappeared into the ship the ship sealed itself it started to make a low throbbing hum er hey shouted arthur and started to run helplessly towards it wait a minute he called what is this what wait a minute the ship rose as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground and hovered briefly it swept strangely up into the evening sky it passed up through the clouds illuminating them briefly and then was gone leaving arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing a helplessly tiny little dance what he screamed what w hat hey what come back here and say that he jumped and danced until his legs trembled and shouted till his lungs rasped there was no answer from anyone there was no one to hear him or speak to him the alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the atmosphere on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the universe from each other its occupant the alien with the expensive complexion leaned back in its single seat his name was wowbagger the infinitely prolonged he was a man with a purpose not a very good purpose as he would have been the first to admit but it was at least a purpose and it did at least keep him on the move wowba gger the infinitely prolonged was ʹ indeed is ʹ one of the universes very small number of immortal beings those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it but wowbagger was not one of them indeed he had come to hate them the load o f serene bastards he had had his immortality thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands the precise details of the accident are not important because no one has ever manag ed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened and many people have ended up looking very silly or dead or both trying wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression put some light jazz on the ships stereo and reflected that he could have made it if it hadnt been for sunday afternoons he really could have done to begin with it was fun he had a ball living dangerously taking risks cleaning up on high ­‐yield long ­‐term investments and just generally outliving the hel l out of everybody in the end it was the sunday afternoons he couldnt cope with and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about when you know that youve had all the baths you can usefully have that day that however hard you star e at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four oclock and you will enter the long dark te atime of the soul so things began to pall for him the merry smiles he used to wear at other peoples funerals began to fade he began to despise the universe in general and everyone in it in particular this was the point at which he conceived his pur pose the thing which would drive him on and which as far as he could see would drive him on forever it was this he would insult the universe that is he would insult everybody in it individually personally one by one and this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over in alphabetical order when people protested to him as they sometimes had done that the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time he w ould merely fix them with a steely look and say a man can dream cant he and so he started out he equipped a spaceship that was built to last with the computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire popula tion of the known universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved his ship fled through the inner orbits of the sol star system preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space computer he said here yipped the computer where next computing that wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the night the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite darkness with light every one every single one was on h is itinerary most of them he would be going to millions of times over he imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky like a childs numbered dots puzzle he hoped that from some vantage point in the universe it might be see n to spell a very very rude word the computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its calculations folfanga it said it beeped fourth world of the folfanga system it continued it beeped again estimated journey time three weeks it continued further it beeped again there to meet with a small slug it beeped of the genus a ­‐rth­‐ urp­‐hil­‐ipdenu i believe it added after a slight pause during which it beeped that you had decided to call it a brainless prat wowbagger grunted he watched the majesty of creation outside his window for a moment or two i think ill take a nap he said and then added what network areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours the computer beeped cosmovid thinkpix and home brain box it said and beeped any movies i havent seen thirty thousand times already no uh theres angst in space youve only seen that thirty ­‐three thousand five hundred and seventeen t imes wake me for the second reel the computer beeped sleep well it said the ship fled on through the night meanwhile on earth it began to pour with rain and arthur dent sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life thinking of things he could have said to the alien and swatting flies who also had a rotten evening the next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because he thought it would be useful to keep things in chapter this morn ing two years later than that was sweet and fragrant as he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a better name for it or find a better cave though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of horror he was suddenly i n a terrifically good mood he wrapped his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at the bright morning the air was clear and scented the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass around his cave the birds were chirruping at each o ther the butterflies were flitting about prettily and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could it wasnt all the pastoral delights that were making arthur feel so cheery though he had just had a wonderful ide a about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation the nightmares the failure of all his attempts at horticulture and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric earth which was that he would go mad he beamed again and t ook a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from his supper he chewed happily for a few moments and then decided formally to announce his decision he stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills to add weight to his words he stu ck the rabbit bone in his hair he spread his arms out wide i will go mad he announced good idea said ford prefect clambering down from the rock on which he had been sitting arthurs brain somersaulted his jaw did press ­‐ups i went mad for a while said ford did me no end of good you see said ford ʹ where have you been interrupted arthur now that his head had finished working out around said ford around and about he grinned in what he accurately judged to be an infuriating manner i just took my mind off the hook for a bit i reckoned that if the world wanted me badly enough it would call back it did he took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his sub­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐matic at least he said i think it did this has been playing up a bit he shook it if it was a false alarm i shall go mad he said again arthur shook his head and sat down he looked up i thought you must be dead he said simply so did i for a while said ford and then i decided i was a lemon for a couple of weeks a kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of a gin and tonic arthur cleared his throat and then did it again where he said did you find a gin an d tonic said ford brightly i found a small lake that thought it was a gin and tonic and jumped in and out of that at least i think it thought it was a gin and tonic i may he added with a grin which would have sent sane men scampering into tree s have been imagining it he waited for a reaction from arthur but arthur knew better than that carry on he said levelly the point is you see said ford that there is no point in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad you might just as well give in and save your sanity for later and this is you sane again is it said arthur i ask merely for information i went to africa said ford yes yes what was that like and this is your cave is it said ford er yes said arthur he felt very strange after nearly four years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see ford that he could almost cry ford was on the other hand an almost immediately annoying person very nice said ford in reference to arthurs cave you must hate it arthur didnt bother to reply africa was very interesting said ford i behaved very oddly there he gazed thoughtfully into the distance i took up being cruel to animals he said airily but only he added as a hobby oh yes said arthur warily yes ford assured him i wont disturb you with the details because they would ʹ what disturb you but you may be interested to know that i am singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe and i tried to learn to fly do you believe me tell me said arthur ill tell you later ill just mention that the guide says the guide the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy you remember yes i remember throwing it in the river yes said ford but i fished it out you didnt tell me i didnt want you to throw it in again fair enough admitted arthur it says what the guide says the guide says there is an art to flying said ford or rather a knack the knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss he smiled weakly he pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows they were all torn and worn through i havent done very well so far he said he stuck out his hand im very glad to see you again arthur he added arthur shook his head in a sudden access of emot ion and bewilderment i havent seen anyone for years he said not anyone i can hardly even remember how to speak i keep forgetting words i practise you see i practise by talking to talking to what are those things people think youre mad if you talk to like george the third kings suggested ford no no said arthur the things he used to talk to were surrounded by them for heavens sake ive planted hundreds myself they all died trees i practise by talking to trees whats t hat for ford still had his hand stuck out arthur looked at it with incomprehension shake prompted ford arthur did nervously at first as if it might turn out to be a fish then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming flood of relief he shook it and shook it after a while ford found it necessary to disengage they climbed to the top o f a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around them what happened to the golgafrinchans asked ford arthur shrugged a lot of them didnt make it through the winter three years ago he said and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a holiday and set off on a raft history says that they must have survived huh said ford well well he stuck his hands on his hips and looked round again at the empty world suddenly there was about ford a sense of energy and purpose were going he said excitedly and shivered with energy where how said arthur i dont know said ford but i just fee l that the time is right things are going to happen were on our way he lowered his voice to a whisper i have detected he said disturbances in the wash he gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow h is hair back dramatically at that point but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he hadnt quite taken his meaning ford repeated it the wash said arthur the space ­‐time wash said ford and as the wind blew briefly past at that moment he bared his teeth into it arthur nodded and then cleared his throat are we talking about he asked cautiously some sort of vogon laundromat or what are we talking abo ut eddies said ford in the space ­‐time continuum ah nodded arthur is he is he he pushed his hands into the pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance what said ford er who said arthur is eddy then exactly ford looked angrily at him will you listen he snapped i have been listening said arthur but im not sure its helped ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody from a telephone company accounts department there seem he said to be some pools he said of instability he said in the fabric he said arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where ford was holding it ford swept on before arthur could turn the foolish look into a foolish remark in the fabric of space ­‐time he said ah that said arthur yes that confirmed ford they stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric earth and stare d each other resolutely in the face and its done what said arthur it said ford has developed pools of instability has it said arthur his eyes not wavering for a moment it has said ford with a similar degree of ocular immobility good said arthur see said ford no said arthur there was a quiet pause the difficulty with this conversation said arthur after a sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop is that its very different from most of the ones ive had of late which as i explained have mostly been with trees they werent like this except perhaps some of the ones ive had with elms which sometimes get a bit bogged down arthur said ford hello yes said arthur just believe everything i tell you and it will all be very very simple ah well im not sure i believe that they sat down and composed their thoughts ford got out his sub ­‐etha sens ­‐o­‐matic it was making vague humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly flat battery said arthur no said ford there is a moving disturbance in the fabric of space ­‐time an eddy a pool of instabi lity and its somewhere in our vicinity where ford moved the device in a slow lightly bobbing semi ­‐circle suddenly the light flashed there said ford shooting out his arm there behind that sofa arthur looked much to his surprise there was a velvet paisley ­‐ covered chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them he boggled intelligently at it shrewd questions sprang into his mind why he said is there a sofa in that field i told you shouted ford leaping to his feet eddie s in the space ­‐ time continuum and this is his sofa is it asked arthur struggling to his feet and he hoped though not very optimistically to his senses arthur shouted ford at him that sofa is there because of the space ­‐time instability iv e been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to grips with its been washed out of the continuum its space ­‐time jetsam it doesnt matter what it is weve got to catch it its our only way out of here he scrambled rapidly down the roc ky outcrop and made off across the field catch it muttered arthur then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass with a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of ford prefect and the irrational piece of furniture they careered wildly through the grass leaping laughing shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way the sun shone dreamily on the s waying grass tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake arthur felt happy he was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad and now he was already chasing a chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric earth the sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through othe rs ford and arthur pounded chaotically after it but it dodged and weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography which it was still they pursued still it danced and span and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrop he graph and they were practically on top of it with a heave and a shout they leapt on it the sun winked out they fell through a sickening nothingness and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at lords cricked ground st johns wood london towards the end of the last test match of the australian series in the year ­‐ with england needing only twenty ­‐eight runs to win important facts from galactic history number one reproduced from the siderial daily mentioners book of popular ga lactic history the night sky over the planet krikkit is the least interesting sight in the entire universe chapter it was a charming and delightful day at lords as ford and arthur tumbled haphazardly out of a space ­‐time anomaly and hit the immaculate turf rather hard the applause of the crowd was tremendous it wasnt for them but instinctively they bowed anyway which was fortunate because the small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding whistled mere millimetres over arthurs head in the crowd a man collapsed they threw themselves back to the ground which seemed to spin hideously around them what was that hissed arthur something red hissed ford back at him where are we er somewhere green shape s muttered arthur i need shapes the applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of astonishment and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what they had just seen or no t this your sofa said a voice what was that whispered ford arthur looked up something blue he said shape said ford arthur looked again it is shaped he hissed at ford with his brow savagely furrowing like a policeman they remained crouched there for a few moments frowning deeply the blue thing shaped like a policeman tapped them both on the shoulders come on you two the shape said lets be having you these words had an electrifying effect on arthur he lea pt to his feet like an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled glanced at the panorama around him which had suddenly settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness where did you get this from he yelled at the policema n shape what did you say said the startled shape this is lords cricket ground isnt it snapped arthur where did you find it how did you get it here i think he added clasping his hand to his brow that i had better calm down he squatte d down abruptly in front of ford it is a policeman he said what do we do ford shrugged what do you want to do he said i want you said arthur to tell me that i have been dreaming for the last five years ford shrugged again and obli ged youve been dreaming for the last five years he said arthur got to his feet its all right officer he said ive been dreaming for the last five years ask him he added pointing at ford he was in it having said this he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch brushing down his dressing gown he then noticed his dressing gown and stopped he stared at it he flung himself at the policeman so where did i get these clothes from he howled he collapsed and lay twitching on t he grass ford shook his head hes had a bad two million years he said to the policeman and together they heaved arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the pitch and were only briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of the sofa on the way reaction to all this from the crowd were many and various most of them couldnt cope with watching it and listened to it on the radio instead well this is an interesting incident brian said one radio commentator to another i dont think there ha ve been any mysterious materializations on the pitch since oh since well i dont think there have been any ʹ have there ʹ that i recall edgbaston ah now what happened then well peter i think it was canter facing willcox coming up to bowl from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight across the pitch there was a pause while the first commentator considered this ye e s he said yes theres nothing actually very mysterious about that is there he didn t actually materialize did he just ran on no thats true but he did claim to have seen something materialize on the pitch ah did he yes an alligator i think of some description ah and had anyone else noticed it apparently not and no one was able to get a very detailed description from him so only the most perfunctory search was made and what happened to the man well i think someone offered to take him off and give him some lunch but he explained that hed already had a rather good one so the matter was dropped and warwickshire went on to win by three wickets so not very like this current instance for those of you whove just tuned in you may be interested to know that er two men two rathe r scruffily attired men and indeed a sofa ʹ a chesterfield i think yes a chesterfield have just materialized here in the middle of lords cricket ground but i dont think they meant any harm theyve been very good ­‐ natured about it and sorry can i interrupt you a moment peter and say that the sofa has just vanished so it has well thats one mystery less still its definitely one for the record books i think particularly occurring at this dramatic moment in play england now needi ng only twenty ­‐four runs to win the series the men are leaving the pitch in the company of a police officer and i think everyones settling down now and play is about to resume now sir said the policeman after they had made a passage through the c urious crowd and laid arthurs peacefully inert body on a blanket perhaps youd care to tell me who you are where you come from and what that little scene was all about ford looked at the ground for a moment as if steadying himself for something th en he straightened up and aimed a look at the policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of the six hundred light ­‐years distance between earth and fords home near betelgeuse all right said ford very quietly ill tell you yes well that wont be necessary said the policeman hurriedly just dont let whatever it was happen again the policeman turned around and wandered off in search of anyone who wasnt from betelgeuse fortunately the ground was full of them arthu rs consciousness approached his body as from a great distance and reluctantly it had had some bad times in there slowly nervously it entered and settled down in to its accustomed position arthur sat up where am i he said lords cricket grou nd said ford fine said arthur and his consciousness stepped out again for a quick breather his body flopped back on the grass ten minutes later hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment tent the colour started to come back to his haggard fa ce howre you feeling said ford im home said arthur hoarsely he closed his eyes and greedily inhaled the steam from his tea as if it was ­‐well as far as arthur was concerned as if it was tea which it was im home he repeated home its england its today the nightmare is over he opened his eyes again and smiled serenely im where i belong he said in an emotional whisper there are two things i fell which i should tell you said ford tossing a copy of the guardian over the ta ble at him im home said arthur yes said ford one is he said pointing at the date at the top of the paper that the earth will be demolished in two days time im home said arthur tea he said cricket he added with pleasure mo wn grass wooden benches white linen jackets beer cans slowly he began to focus on the newspaper he cocked his head on one side with a slight frown ive seen that one before he said his eyes wandered slowly up to the date which ford was idly tapping at his face froze for a second or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which arctic ice ʹ floes do so spectacularly in the spring and the other thing said ford is that you appear to have a bone in your beard he tossed back his tea outside the refreshment tent the sun was shining on a happy crowd it shone on white hats and red faces it shone on ice lollies and melted them it shone on the tears of small children whose ice lollies had just melted and fallen off the stick it shone on the trees it flashed off whirling cricket bats it gleamed off the utterly extraordinary object which was parked behind the sight ­‐screens and which nobody appeared to have noticed it beamed on ford and arthur as they emerged blinking from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene around them arthur was shaking perhaps he said i should no said ford sharply what said arthu r dont try and phone yourself up at home how did you know ford shrugged but why not said arthur people who talk to themselves on the phone said ford never learn anything to their advantage but look said ford he picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an imaginary dial hello he said into the imaginary mouthpiece is that arthur dent ah hello yes this is arthur dent speaking dont hang up he looked at the imaginary mouthpiece in disappointment he hung u p he said shrugged and put the imaginary phone neatly back on its imaginary hook this is not my first temporal anomaly he added a glummer look replaced the already glum look on arthur dents face so were not home and dry he said we coul d not even be said replied ford to be home and vigorously towelling ourselves off the game continued the bowler approached the wicket at a lope a trot and then a run he suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms and legs out of which flew a ball th e batsman swung and thwacked it behind him over the sight ­‐screens fords eyes followed the trajectory of the ball and jogged momentarily he stiffened he looked along the flight path of the ball again and his eyes twitched again this isnt my towel said arthur who was rummaging in his rabbit ­‐skin bag shhh said ford he screwed his eyes up in concentration i had a golgafrinchan jogging towel continued arthur it was blue with yellow stars on it this isnt it shhh said ford again he covered one eye and looked with the other this ones pink said arthur it isnt yours is it i would like you to shut up about your towel said ford it isnt my towel insisted arthur that is the point i am trying to and the time at which i would like you to shut up about it continued ford in a low growl is now all right said arthur starting to stuff it back into the primitively stitched rabbit ­‐skin bag i realize that it is probably not important in the cosmic scale of things its just odd thats all a pink towel suddenly instead of a blue one with yell ow stars ford was beginning to behave rather strangely or rather not actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a way which was strangely different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved what he was doing was this regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow members of the crowd gathered round the pitch he was waving his hands in sharp movements across his face ducking down behind some people leaping up behind others then standing still and blinking a lot after a moment or two of this he started to stalk forward slowly and stealthily wearing a puzzled frown of concentration like a leopard thats not sure whether its just seen a half­‐empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty plain this isnt my bag either said arthur suddenly fords spell of concentration was broken he turned angrily on arthur i wasnt talking about my towel said arthur weve established that that isnt mine its just that the b ag into which i was putting the towel which is not mine is also not mine though it is extraordinarily similar now personally i think that that is extremely odd especially as the bag was one i made myself on prehistoric earth these are also not my stone s he added pulling a few flat grey stones out of the bag i was making a collection of interesting stones and these are clearly very dull ones a roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated whatever it was that ford said in reply to this piece of information the cricket ball which had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into arthurs mysterious rabbit ­‐skin bag now i would say that that was also a very curious event said arthur rapidly closing the bag a nd pretending to look for the ball on the ground i dont think its here he said to the small boys who immediately clustered round him to join in the search it probably rolled off somewhere over there i expect he pointed vaguely in the direction in which he wished they would push off one of the boys looked at him quizzically you all right said the boy no said arthur then why you got a bone in your beard said the boy im training it to like being wherever its put arthur prided himself on saying this it was he thought exactly the sort of thing which would entertain and stimulate young minds oh said the small boy putting his head to one side and thinking about it whats your name dent said arthur arthur dent youre a jerk dent said the boy a complete asshole the boy looked past him at something else to show that he wasnt in any particular hurry to run away and then wandered off scratching his nose suddenly arthur remembered that the earth was goin g to be demolished again in two days time and just this once didnt feel too bad about it play resumed with a new ball the sun continued to shine and ford continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking somethings on your mind isnt i t said arthur i think said ford in a tone of voice which arthur by now recognized as one which presaged something utterly unintelligible that theres an sep over there he pointed curiously enough the direction he pointed in was not the one in which he was looking arthur looked in the one direction which was towards the sight ­‐screens and in the other which was at the field of play he nodded he shrugged he shrugged again a what he said an sep an s ep and whats t hat somebody elses problem ah good said arthur and relaxed he had no idea what all that was about but at least it seemed to be over it wasnt over there said ford again pointing at the sight ­‐screens and looking at the pitch where said arthur there said ford i see said arthur who didnt you do said ford what said arthur can you see said ford patiently the sep i thought you said that was somebody elses problem thats right arthur nodded slowly carefully and with an air of immense stupidity and i want to know said ford if you can see it you do yes what said arthur does it look like well how should i know you fool shouted ford if you can see it you tell me arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with ford his brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel ford took him by the arm an sep he said is something that we cant see or dont see or our brain doesnt let us see because we think that its somebody elses problem thats what sep means somebody elses problem the brain just edits it out its like a blind spot if you look at it dire ctly you wont see it unless you know precisely what it is your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye ah said arthur then thats why yes said ford who knew what arthur was going to say youve been jumping up and yes down and blinking yes and i think youve got the message i can see it said arthur its a spaceship for a moment arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation provoked a roar erupted from the crowd and from every direction people were running shouting yelling tumbling over each other in a tumult of confusion he stumbled back in astonishment and glanced fearfully around then he glanced around again in even greater astonishment exciting isnt it said an apparition the apparition wobbled in front of arthurs eyes though the truth of the matter is probably that arthurs eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition his mouth wobbled as well w w w w his mouth said i think your team have just won said the apparition w w w w repeated arthur and punctuated each wobble with a prod at ford prefects back ford was staring at the tumult in trepidation you are english arent you said the apparition w w w w yes said arthur well your team as i say have just won the match it means they retain the ashes you must be very pleased i must say im rather fond of cricket though i wouldnt like anyone outside this planet to hear me saying that oh dear no the apparition g ave what looked as if it might have been a mischievous grin but it was hard to tell because the sun was directly behind him creating a blinding halo round his head and illuminating his silver hair and beard in a way which was awesome dramatic and hard t o reconcile with mischievous grins still he said itll all be over in a couple of days wont it though as i said to you when we last met i was very sorry about that still whatever will have been will have been arthur tried to speak but gav e up the unequal struggle he prodded ford again i thought something terrible had happened said ford but its just the end of the game we ought to get out oh hello slartibartfast what are you doing here oh pottering pottering said the o ld man gravely that your ship can you give us a lift anywhere patience patience the old man admonished ok said ford its just that this planets going to be demolished pretty soon i know that said slartibartfast and well i just wanted to make that point said ford the point is taken and if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket pitch at this point i do then its your ship it is i suppose ford turned away sharply at this point hello slartibartfast said arthur at last hello earthman said slartibartfast after all said ford we can only die once the old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch with eyes that seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent b earing on what was happening out there what was happening was that the crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the centre of the pitch what slartibartfast saw in it he alone knew ford was humming something it was just one note repeated at intervals he was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was humming but nobody did if anybody had asked him he would have said he was humming the first line of a nöel coward song called mad about the boy over and over again it would then have be en pointed out to him that he was only singing one note to which he would have replied that for reasons which he hoped would be apparent he was omitting the about the boy bit he was annoyed that nobody asked its just he burst out at last that if we dont go soon we might get caught in the middle of it all again and theres nothing that depresses me more than seeing a planet being destroyed except possibly still being on it when it happens or he added in an undertone hanging around crick et matches patience said slartibartfast again great things are afoot thats what you said last time we met said arthur they were said slartibartfast yes thats true admitted arthur all however that seemed to be afoot was a cere mony of some kind it was being specially staged for the benefit of tv rather than the spectators and all they could gather about it from where they were standing was what they heard from a nearby radio ford was aggressively uninterested he fretted as he heard it explained that the ashes were about to be presented to the captain of the english team out there on the pitch fumed when told that this was because they had now won them for the nth time positively barked with annoyance at the i nformation that the ashes were the remains of a cricket stump and when further to this he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket stump in question had been burnt in melbourne australia in to signify the death of english cricket h e rounded on slartibartfast took a deep breath but didnt have a chance to say anything because the old man wasnt there he was marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in his gait his hair beard and robes swept behind him looking very much as moses would have looked if sinai had been a well ­‐cut lawn instead of as it is more usually represented a fiery smoking mountain he said to meet him at his ship said arthur what in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing exploded ford meeting us at his ship in two minutes said arthur with a shrug which indicated total abdication of thought they started off towards it strange sounds reached their ears they tried not to listen but could not help noticing that slartibartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn containing the ashes as they were he said vitally important for the past present and future safety of the galaxy and that this was causing wild hilarity they resolved to ignore it what happened next they could not ignore with a noise like a hundred thousand people saying wop a steely white spaceship suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite menace and a slight hum then for a while it did nothing as if it expected everybody to go about their normal business and not mind it just hanging there then it did something quite extraordinary or rather it opened up and let something quite extraordinary com e out of it eleven quite extraordinary things they were robots white robots what was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to have come dressed for the occasion not only were they white but they carried what appeared to be cricket ba ts and not only that but they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls and not only that but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts of their legs these last were extraordinary because they appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously civilized robots to fly down from their hovering spaceship and start to kill people which is what they did hello said arthur something seems to be happening get to the ship shouted ford i dont want to know i dont want to see i dont want to hear he yelled as he ran this is not my planet i didnt choose to be here i dont want to get involved just get me out of here and get me to a party with people i can relate to smoke and flame billowed from the pitch well the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force here today burbled a radio happily to itself what i need shouted ford by way of clarifying his previous remarks is a strong drink and a peer ­‐group he continued to run pausing only for a moment to grab arthurs arm and drag him along with him arthur had adopted his normal crisis role which was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him theyre playing cricket muttered arthur stumbling along after ford i sw ear they are playing cricket i do not know why they are doing this but that is what they are doing theyre not just killing people theyre sending them up he shouted ford theyre sending us up it would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great deal more galactic history than arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels the ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting str okes the difference being that every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed the very first one of these had dispelled arthurs initial reaction that the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by australian margarine manufactur ers and then as suddenly as it had all started it was over the eleven white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight formation and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship which with the noise of a hundred thousand people saying foop promptly vanished into the thin air out of which it had wopped for a moment there was a terrible stunned silence and then out of the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of slartibartfast looking even more lik e moses because in spite of the continued absence of the mountain he was at least now striding across a fiery and smoking well­‐mown lawn he stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of arthur dent and ford prefect forcing their way throug h the frightened crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite direction the crowd was clearly thinking to itself about what an unusual day this was turning out to be and not really knowing which way if any to turn slartibartfast was gesturing urgently at ford and arthur and shouting at them as the three of them gradually converged on his ship still parked behind the sight ­‐screens and still apparently unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it who presumably had enough of their own p roblems to cope with at that time theyve garble warble farble shouted slartibartfast in his thin tremulous voice what did he say panted ford as he elbowed his way onwards arthur shook his head theyve something or other he said theyve table warble farble shouted slartibartfast again ford and arthur shook their heads at each other it sounds urgent said arthur he stopped and shouted what theyve garble warble fashes cried slartibartfast still waving at them he says said arthur that theyve taken the ashes that is what i think he says they ran on the said ford ashes said arthur tersely the burnt remains of a cricket stump its a trophy that he was panting is apparently what they have come and taken he shook his head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull strange thing to want to tell us snapped ford strange thing to take strange ship they had arrived at it th e second strangest thing about the ship was watching the somebody elses problem field at work they could now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because they knew it was there it was quite apparent however that nobody else could this wasnt b ecause it was actually invisible or anything hyper ­‐ impossible like that the technology involved in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninety ­‐nine thousand million nine hundred and ninety ­‐nine million nine hundred and ninety ­‐nine thousand nine hundred and ninety ­‐nine times out of a billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it the ultra ­‐famous sciento ­‐magician effrafax of wug once bet his life that given a year he coul d render the great megamountain magramal entirely invisible having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense lux ­‐o­‐ valves and refracto ­‐nullifiers and spectrum ­‐bypass ­‐o­‐matics he realized with nine hours to go that he wasnt going to make it so he and his friends and his friends friends and his friends friends friends and his friends friends friends friends and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company put in what now is widely r ecognized as being the hardest nights work in history and sure enough on the following day magramal was no longer visible effrafax lost his bet ʹ and therefore his life ʹ simply because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed a that when walkin g around the area that magramal ought to be he didnt trip over or break his nose on anything and b a suspicious ­‐looking extra moon the somebody elses problem field is much simpler and more effective and whats more can be run for over a hundred yea rs on a single torch battery this is because it relies on peoples natural disposition not to see anything they dont want to werent expecting or cant explain if effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected a cheap and simple somebody elses pr oblem field on it then people would have walked past the mountain round it even over it and simply never have noticed that the thing was there and this is precisely what was happening with slartibartfasts ship it wasnt pink but if it had been th at would have been the least of its visual problems and people were simply ignoring it like anything the most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a spaceship with guidance fins rocket engines and escape hatches and so on an d a great deal like a small upended italian bistro ford and arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply offended sensibilities yes i know said slartibartfast hurrying up to them at that point breathless and agitated but there is a reason come we must go the ancient nightmare is come again doom confronts us all we must leave at once i fancy somewhere sunny said ford ford and arthur followed slartibartfast into the ship and were so perplexed by what they saw inside it that they w ere totally unaware of what happened next outside a spaceship yet another one but this one sleek and silver descended from the sky on to the pitch quietly without fuss its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology it landed gently it extended a short ramp a tall grey ­‐green figure marched briskly out and approached the small knot of people who were gathered in the centre of the pitch tending to the casualties of the recent bizarre massacre it moved people aside with quiet understated authority and came at last to a man lying in a desperate pool of blood clearly now beyond the reach of any earthly medicine breathing coughing his last the figure knelt down quietly beside him arthur philip deodat asked the figure the man with horrified confusion in eyes nodded feebly youre a no ­‐good dumbo nothing whispered the creature i thought you should know that before you went important facts from galactic history number two reproduced from the siderial dai ly mentioners book of popular galactic history since this galaxy began vast civilizations have risen and fallen risen and fallen risen and fallen so often that its quite tempting to think that life in the galaxy must be a something akin to seasick ʹ space ­‐sick time sick history sick or some such thing and b stupid chapter it seemed to arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside and let them through it seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the cosmos were streaming through each other it seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the universe and that the wind was him it seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the universe and that the universe was a thought of his it seemed to the people at lords cricket ground that another north london restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do and that this was somebody elses problem what happened whispered arthur in considerable awe we took off said slartibartfast arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch he wasnt certain whether he had just got space ­‐sickness or religion nice mover said ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the degree to which he had been impressed by what slartibartfas ts ship had just done shame about the decor for a moment or two the old man didnt reply he was staring at the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning down then his b row cleared and he stared for a moment at the wide panoramic screen in front of him which displayed a bewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them his lips moved as if he was trying to spell something suddenly his eyes dart ed in alarm back to his instruments but then his expression merely subsided into a steady frown he looked back up at the screen he felt his own pulse his frown deepened for a moment then he relaxed its a mistake to try and understand mathematics he said they only worry me what did you say decor said ford pity about it deep in the fundamental heart of mind and universe said slartibartfast there is a reason ford glanced sharply around he clearly thought this was taking an optimistic view of things the interior of the flight deck was dark green dark red dark brown cramped and moodily lit inexplicably the resemblance to a small italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway small pools of light picked out pot plants g lazed tiles and all sorts of little unidentifiable brass things rafia ­‐wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows the instruments which had occupied slartibartfasts attention seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in concrete ford reached out and touched it fake concrete plastic fake bottles set in fake concrete the fundamental heart of mind and universe can take a running jump he thought to himself this is rubbish on the other hand it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved made the heart of gold seem like an electric pram he swung himself off t he couch he brushed himself down he looked at arthur who was singing quietly to himself he looked at the screen and recognized nothing he looked at slartibartfast how far did we just travel he said about said slartibartfast about two thir ds of the way across the galactic disc i would say roughly yes roughly two thirds i think its a strange thing said arthur quietly that the further and faster one travels across the universe the more ones position in it seems to be largely i mmaterial and one is filled with a profound or rather emptied of a yes very strange said ford where are we going we are going said slartibartfast to confront an ancient nightmare of the universe and where are you going to drop us off i will need your help tough look theres somewhere you can take us where we can have fun im trying to think of it we can get drunk and maybe listen to some extremely evil music hold on ill look it up he dug out his copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and tipped through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and rock and roll a curse has arisen from the mists of time said slartibartfast yes i expect so said ford hey he said lighting accidentally on one particular reference entry eccentrica gallumbits did you ever meet her the triple ­‐breasted whore of eroticon six some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body me i disagree i say five a curse said slartibartfast which will engulf the galaxy in fire and destruction and possibly bring the universe to a premature doom i mean it he added sounds like a bad time said ford with luck ill be drunk enough not to notice here he said stabbing his finger at the screen of the guide would be a really wicked place to go and i think we should what do you say arthur stop mumbling mantras and pay attention theres important stuff youre missing here arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head where are we going he said to confront an ancient night ʹ can it said ford arthur we are going out into the galaxy to have some fun is that an idea you can cope with whats slar tibartfast looking so anxious about said arthur nothing said ford doom said slartibartfast come he added with sudden authority there is much i must show and tell you he walked towards a green wrought ­‐iron spiral staircase set incompre hensibly in the middle of the flight deck and started to ascend arthur with a frown followed ford slung the guide sullenly back into his satchel my doctor says that i have a malformed public ­‐duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre he m uttered to himself and that i am therefore excused from saving universes nevertheless he stomped up the stairs behind them what they found upstairs was just stupid or so it seemed and ford shook his head buried his face in his hands and slumped against a pot plant crushing it against the wall the central computational area said slartibartfast unperturbed this is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed yes i know what it looks like but it is in fact a complex four­‐dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex mathematical functions it looks like a joke said arthur i know what it looks like said slartibartfast and went into it as he did so arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it might mean but he refused to believe it the universe could not possibly work like that he thought cannot possibly that he tho ught to himself would be as absurd as he terminated that line of thinking most of the really absurd things he could think of had already happened and this was one of them it was a large glass cage or box ­‐in fact a room in it was a table a long one around it were gathered about a dozen chairs of the bentwood style on it was a tablecloth ʹ a grubby red and white check tablecloth scarred with the occasional cigarette burn each presumably at a precise calculated mathematical position and on the tablecloth sat some half ­‐eaten italian meals hedged about with half ­‐eaten breadsticks and half ­‐drunk glasses of wine and toyed with listlessly by robots it was all completely artificial the robot customers were attended by a robot waiter a rob ot wine waiter and a robot maetre d the furniture was artificial the tablecloth artificial and each particular piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of say a pollo sorpreso without actually being one and all participated in a little dance together ʹ a complex routine involving the manipulation of menus bill pads wallets cheque books credit cards watches pencils and paper napkins which seemed to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence but n ever actually getting anywhere slartibartfast hurried in and then appeared to pass the time of day quite idly with the maetre d whilst one of the customer robots an autorory slid slowly under the table mentioning what he intended to do to some guy over some girl slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and passed a shrewd eye over the menu the tempo of the routine round the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken arguments broke out people attempted to prove things on napkins they waved fiercely at each other and attempted to examine each others pieces of chicken the waiters hand began to move on the bill pad more quickly than a human hand could manage and then more quickly than a human eye could follow the pace accelerated soon an extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group and seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly achieved a new vibration thrilled through the ship slartibartfast emerged from the glass room bistromathics he said the most powerful computational force known to parascience come to the room of informational illusions he swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake chapter the bistromatic drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with improbability factors bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers just as einstein observed that time was not an absolute but depended on the observers movement in space and that space was not an absolute but depended on the observers movement in time so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute but depend o n the observers movement in restaurants the first non ­‐absolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved this will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant and then bear no apparent relation to th e number of people who actually turn up or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the showmatchpartygig or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up the second non ­‐absolute number is the given time of a rrival which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts a recipriversexcluson a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself in other words the given time of arrival is the one moment of tim e at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of maths including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the somebody elses problem field the third and most mysterious piece of non ­‐absoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill the cost of each item the number of people at the table and what they are each prepared to pay for the number of pe ople who have actually brought any money is only a sub ­‐phenomenon in this field the baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously they were at the time put down to such things as politeness rudeness meanness flashness tiredness emotionality or the lateness of the hour and completely forgotten about on the following morning they were never tested under laboratory conditions of course because they never oc curred in laboratories ʹ not in reputable laboratories at least and so it was only with the advent of pocket computers that the startling truth became finally apparent and it was this numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of restaura nts do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the universe this single fact took the scientific world by storm it completely revolutionized it so many mathematical conferences got held in such good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died of obesity and heart failure and the science of math s was put back by years slowly however the implications of the idea began to be understood to begin with it had been too stark too crazy too much what the man in the street would have said oh yes i could have told you that about then some phra ses like interactive subjectivity frameworks were invented and everybody was able to relax and get on with it the small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the major research institutes singing strange chants to the effect that the univers e was only a figment of its own imagination were eventually given a street theatre grant and went away chapter in space travel you see said slartibartfast as he fiddled with some instruments in the room of informational illusions in space travel he stopped and looked about him the room of informational illusions was a welcome relief after the visual monstrosities of the central computational area there was nothing in it no information no illusions just themselves white walls and a few small instruments which looked as if they were meant to plug into something which slartibartfast couldnt find yes urged arthur he had picked up slartibartfasts sense of urgency but didnt know what to do with it yes what said the old man you were saying slartibartfast looked at him sharply the numbers he said are awful he resumed his search arthur nodded wisely to himself after a while he realized that this wasnt getting him anywhere and decided that he would say what after all in space travel repeated slartibartfast all the numbers are awful arthur nodded again and looked round to ford for help but ford was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it i was only said slartibartfast with a sigh trying to save you the trouble of asking me why all the ships computations were being done on a waiters bill pad arthur frowned why he said were all the ships computations being done on a wait ʹ he stopped slartibartfast said because in space travel all the numbers are awful he could tell that he wasnt getting his point across listen he said on a waiters bill pad numbers dance you must have encountered the phenomenon well on a waiters bill pad said slartibartf ast reality and unreality collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible within certain parameters what parameters its impossible to say said slartibartfast thats one of them strange but true at least i think its strange he added and im assured that its true at that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had been searching and clicked the instrument he was holding into it do not be alarmed he said and then suddenly darted an alarmed look at himself and lunged back its they didnt hear what he said because at that moment the ship winked out of existence around them and a starbattle ­‐ship the size of a small midlands industrial city plunged out of the sundered night towards them star lasers ablaze they gaped pop ­‐eyed and were unable to scream chapter another world another day another dawn the early mornings thinnest sliver of light appeared silently several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small cold and slightly damp there is a moment in every dawn when ligh t floats there is the possibility of magic creation holds its breath the moment passed as it regularly did on squornshellous zeta without incident the mist clung to the surface of the marshes the swamp trees were grey with it the tall reeds indist inct it hung motionless like held breath nothing moved there was silence the sun struggled feebly with the mist tried to impart a little warmth here shed a little light there but clearly today was going to be just another long haul across the sky nothing moved again silence nothing moved silence very often on squornshellous zeta whole days would go on like this and this was indeed going to be one of them fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort and a few hours later it reappeared squared its shoulders and started on up the sky again this time however something was happening a mattress had just met a robot hello robot said the mattress bleah said the robot and continued what it was doing which was walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle happy said the mattress the robot stopped and looked at the mattress it looked at it quizzically it was clearly a very stupid mattre ss it looked back at him with wide eyes after what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general contempt for all things mattressy the robot continued to walk round in tight cir cles we could have a conversation said the mattress would you like that it was a large mattress and probably one of quite high quality very few things actually get manufactured these days because in an infinitely large universe such as for in stance the one in which we live most things one could possibly imagine and a lot of things one would rather not grow somewhere a forest was discovered recently in which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit the life cycle of ratchet sc rewdriver fruit it quite interesting once picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years then one night it suddenly hatches discards its outer skin which crumbles into dust and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little m etal object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole for a screw this when found will get thrown away no one knows what it is supposed to gain from this nature in her infinite wisdom is presumably working on it no one reall y knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their lives either they are large friendly pocket ­‐sprung creatures which live quiet private lives in the marshes of squornshellous zeta many of them get caught slaughtered dried out shipped out and slep t on none of them seem to mind and all of them are called zem no said marvin my name said the mattress is zem we could discuss the weather a little marvin paused again in his weary circular plod the dew he observed has clearly falle n with a particularly sickening thud this morning he resumed his walk as if inspired by this conversational outburst to fresh heights of gloom and despondency he plodded tenaciously if he had had teeth he would have gritted them at this point he hadnt he didnt the mere plod said it all the mattress flolloped around this is a thing that only live mattresses in swamps are able to do which is why the word is not in more common usage it flolloped in a sympathetic sort of way moving a fairish bo dy of water as it did so it blew a few bubbles up through the water engagingly its blue and white stripes glistened briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had unexpectedly made it through the mist causing the creature to bask momentarily marvin pl odded you have something on your mind i think said the mattress floopily more than you can possibly imagine dreaded marvin my capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the infinite reaches of space itself except of course f or my capacity for happiness stomp stomp he went my capacity for happiness he added you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first the mattress globbered this is the noise made by a live swamp ­‐ dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal tragedy the word can also according to the ultra ­‐complete maximegalon dictionary of every language ever mean the noise made by the lord high sanvalvwag of hollop on discovering that he has forgotten his wifes birthday for the second year running since there was only ever one lord high sanvalvwag of hollop and he never married the word is only ever used in a negative or specula tive sense and there is an ever ­‐increasing body of opinion which holds that the ultra ­‐complete maximegalon dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to cart its microstored edition around in strangely enough the dictionary omits the word fl oopily which simply means in the manner of something which is floopy the mattress globbered again i sense a deep dejection in your diodes it vollued for the meaning of the word vollue buy a copy of squornshellous swamptalk at any remaindered bookshop or alternatively buy the ultra ­‐complete maximegalon dictionary as the university will be very glad to get it off their hands and regain some valuable parking lots and it saddens me you should be more mattresslike we live quiet retired live s in the swamp where we are content to flollop and vollue and regard the wetness in a fairly floopy manner some of us are killed but all of us are called zem so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to a minimum why are you walking in circle s because my leg is stuck said marvin simply it seems to me said the mattress eyeing it compassionately that it is a pretty poor sort of leg you are right said marvin it is voon said the mattress i expect so said marvin an d i also expect that you find the idea of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing you should tell your friends zem and zem when you see them later theyll laugh if i know them which i dont of course ʹ except insofar as i know all organic life forms which is much better than i would wish to ha but my life is but a box of wormgears he stomped around again in his tiny circle around his thin steel peg­‐leg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck but why do you just keep walking round and round said the mattress just to make the point said marvin and continued round and round consider it made my dear friend flurbled the mattress consider it made just another million years sa id marvin just another quick million then i might try it backwards just for the variety you understand the mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in this futil e and fruitless manner and with another quiet flurble he did so oh just over the one ­‐point ­‐five­‐million mark just over said marvin airily ask me if i ever get bored go on ask me the mattress did marvin ignored the question he merely trudg ed with added emphasis i gave a speech once he said suddenly and apparently unconnectedly you may not instantly see why i bring the subject up but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast and i am at a rough estimate thirty billion time s more intelligent than you let me give you an example think of a number any number er five said the mattress wrong said marvin you see the mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was in the presence of a not unremarkab le mind it willomied along its entire length sending excited little ripples through its shallow algae ­‐ covered pool it gupped tell me it urged of the speech you once made i long to hear it it was received very badly said marvin for a var iety of reasons i delivered it he added pausing to make an awkward humping sort of gesture with his not ­‐exactly ­‐good arm but his arm which was better than the other one which was dishearteningly welded to his left side over there about a mile dista nce he was pointing as well as he could manage and he obviously wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could manage through the mist over the reeds to a part of the marsh which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh there he repeated i was somewhat of a celebrity at the time excitement gripped the mattress it had never heard of speeches being delivered on squornshellous zeta and certainly not by celebrities water spattered off it as a thrill glurrie d across its back it did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do summoning every bit of its strength it reared its oblong body heaved it up into the air and held it quivering there for a few seconds whilst it peered through the mist over t he reeds at the part of the marsh which marvin had indicated observing without disappointment that it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh the effort was too much and it flodged back into its pool deluging marvin with smelly mud mos s and weeds i was a celebrity droned the robot sadly for a short while on account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing sun you can guess from my condition he added how narro w my escape was i was rescued by a scrap ­‐metal merchant imagine that here i am brain the size of never mind he trudged savagely for a few seconds he it was who fixed me up with this leg hateful isnt it he sold me to a mind zoo i was the s tar exhibit i had to sit on a box and tell my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive give us a grin little robot they would shout at me give us a little chuckle i would explain to them that to get my face to grin would take a good couple of hours in a workshop with a wrench and that went down very well the speech urged the mattress i long to hear of the speech you gave in the marshes there was a bridge built across the marshes a cyberstructured hyperbridge hundre ds of miles in length to carry ion ­‐buggies and freighters over the swamp a bridge quirruled the mattress here in the swamp a bridge confirmed marvin here in the swamp it was going to revitalize the economy of the squornshellous system th ey spent the entire economy of the squornshellous system building it they asked me to open it poor fools it began to rain a little a fine spray slid through the mist i stood on the platform for hundreds of miles in front of me and hundreds of mi les behind me the bridge stretched did it glitter enthused the mattress it glittered did it span the miles majestically it spanned the miles majestically did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible mist yes said marvin do you want to hear this story i want to hear your speech said the mattress this is what i said i said i would like to say that it is a very great pleasure honour and privilege for me to open this bridge but i cant because my lying circuits are all out of commission i hate and despise you all i now declare this hapless cy berstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly cross her and i plugged myself into the opening circuits marvin paused remembering the moment the mattress flurred and glurried it flolloped gupped and willomied doing this last in a particularly floopy way voon it wurfed at last and it was a magnificent occasion reasonably magnificent the entire thousand ­‐mile­‐long bridge spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire taking everybody with it there was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation during which a hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say wop and a team of white robots descended from the sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military fo rmation for a sudden violent moment they were all there in the swamp wrenching marvins false leg off and then they were gone again in their ship which said foop you see the sort of thing i have to contend with said marvin to the gobbering matt ress suddenly a moment later the robots were back again for another violent incident and this time when they left the mattress was alone in the swamp he flolloped around in astonishment and alarm he almost lurgled in fear he reared himself to see over the reeds but there was nothing to see just more reeds he listened but there was no sound on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of half ­‐crazed etymologists calling distantly to each other across the sullen mire chapter the body of arth ur dent span the universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it and each particular shard span silently through the void reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction and then the blackness b ehind the universe exploded and each particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell and the nothingness behind the blackness behind the universe erupted and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the shattered universe was at l ast the dark figure of an immense man speaking immense words these then said the figure speaking from an immensely comfortable chair were the krikkit wars the greatest devastation ever visited upon our galaxy what you have experienced slart ibartfast floated past waving its just a documentary he called out this is not a good bit terribly sorry trying to find the rewind control is what billions of billions of innocent do not called out slartibartfast floating past again and fiddling furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the room of informational illusions and which was in fact still stuck there agree to buy anything at this point peop le creatures your fellow beings music swelled ʹ again it was immense music immense chords and behind the man slowly three tall pillars began to emerge out of the immensely swirling mist experienced lived through ʹ or more often failed to live through think of that my friends and let us not forget ʹ and in just a moment i shall be able to suggest a way which will help us always to remember ʹ that before the krikkit wars the galaxy was that rare and wonderful thing a happy galaxy the music was going bananas with immensity at this point a happy galaxy my friends as represented by the symbol of the wikkit gate the three pillars stood out clearly now three pillars topped with two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingl y familiar to arthurs addled brain the three pillars thundered the man the steel pillar which represented the strength and power of the galaxy searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the pillar on the left which was clearly made of steel or something very like it the music thumped and bellowed the perspex pillar announced the man representing the forces of science and reason in the galaxy other searchlights played exotically up and down the righthand transparent pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and a sudden inexplicable craving for ice ­‐cream in the stomach of arthur dent and the thunderous voice continued the wooden pillar representing and here his voice became just very slightly hoarse with wonderful sentiments the forces of nature and spirituality the lights picked out the central pillar the music moved bravely up into the realms of complete unspeakability between them supporting the voice rolled on approaching its climax the golden bail of prosperity and the silver bail of peace the whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights and the music had now fortunately gone far beyond the limits of the discernible at the top of the three pillars the two brilliantly gleam ing bails sat and dazzled there seemed to be girls sitting on top of them or maybe they were meant to be angels angels are usually represented as wearing more than that though suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was presumably meant to be the cosmos and a darkening of the lights there is not a world thrilled the mans expert voice not a civilized world in the galaxy where this symbol is not revered even today even in primitive worlds it persists in racial memories this it was that the forces of krikkit destroyed and this it is that now locks their world away till the end of eternity and with a flourish the man produced in his hands a model of the wikkit gate scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole extraordinary spectacle but the model looked as if it must have been about three feet high not the original key of course that as everyone knows was destroyed blasted into the ever ­‐whirling eddies of the space ­‐time continuum and lost for ever this is a remarkable replica hand ­‐tooled by skilled craftsmen lovingly assembled using ancient craft secrets into a memento you will be proud to own in memory of those who fell and in tribute to the galaxy ʹ our galaxy ʹ which they died to defend slartibartfast floated past again at this moment found it he said we can lose all this rubbish just dont nod thats all now let us bow our heads in payment intoned the voice and then said it again much faster and backwards lights came and went the pillars disappeared the man gabled himself backwards into nothing the universe snappily reassembled itself around them you get the gist said slartibartfast im astonished said arthur and bewildered i was asleep said ford who floated into view at this point did i miss anything they found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the edge of an agonizingly high cliff the wind whipped out from their faces and across a bay on which the remains of one of the great est and most powerful space battle ­‐fleets ever assembled in the galaxy was briskly burning itself back into existence the sky was a sullen pink darkening via a rather curious colour to blue and upwards to black smoke billowed down out of it at an incred ible lick events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be distinguished and when a short while later a huge starbattle ­‐ship rushed away from them as if theyd said boo they only just recognized it as the point at which they had come i n but now things were too rapid a video ­‐tactile blur which brushed and jiggled them through centuries of galactic history turning twisting flickering the sound was a mere thin thrill periodically through the thickening jumble of events they sensed appalling catastrophes deep horrors cataclysmic shocks and these were always associated with certain recurring images the only images which ever stood out clearly from the avalance of tum bling history a wicket gate a small hard red ball hard white robots and also something less distinct something dark and cloudy but there was also another sensation which rose clearly out of the thrilling passage of time just as a slow series of cl icks when speeded up will lose the definition of each individual click and gradually take on the quality of a sustained and rising tone so a series of individual impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion ʹ and yet not an emotion if it w as an emotion it was a totally emotionless one it was hatred implacable hatred it was cold not like ice is cold but like a wall is cold it was impersonal not as a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal but like a computer ­‐issued parking summ ons is impersonal and it was deadly ʹ again not like a bullet or a knife is deadly but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly and just as a rising tone will change in character and take on harmonics as it rises so again this emotionless emoti on seemed to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a scream of guilt and failure and suddenly it stopped they were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening the sun was setting all around them softly undul ating green countryside rolled off gently into the distance birds sang about what they thought of it all and the general opinion seemed to be good a little way away could be heard the sound of children playing and a little further away than the apparen t source of that sound could be seen in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town the town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made of white stone the skyline was of gentle pleasing curves the sun had nearly set as if out of nowhere music began slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped a voice said this slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped i will tell you about it he said quietly the place was peaceful arthur felt happy even ford seeme d cheerful they walked a short way in the direction of the town and the informational illusion of the grass was pleasant and springy under their feet and the informational illusion of the flowers smelt sweet and fragrant only slartibartfast seemed appr ehensive and out of sorts he stopped and looked up it suddenly occurred to arthur that coming as this did at the end so to speak or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just blurredly experienced something nasty must be about to happen he was distressed to think that something nasty could happen to somewhere as idyllic as this he too glanced up there was nothing in the sky theyre not about to attack here are they he said he realized that this was merely a recording he was walki ng through but he still felt alarmed nothing is about to attack here said slartibartfast in a voice which unexpectedly trembled with emotion this is where it all started this is the place itself this is krikkit he stared up into the sky the sky from one horizon to another from east to west from north to south was utterly and completely black chapter stomp stomp whirrr pleased to be of service shut up thank you stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp whirrr thank you for making a simple door very happy hope your diodes rot thank you have a nice day stomp stomp stomp stomp whirrr it is my pleasure to open for you zark off and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done i said zark off thank you for listening to this message stomp stomp stomp stomp wop zaphod stopped stomping he had been stomping around the heart of gold for days and so far no door had said wop to him he was fairly ce rtain that no door had said wop to him now it was not the sort of thing doors said too concise furthermore there were not enough doors it sounded as if a hundred thousand people had said wop which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship it was dark most of the ships non ­‐essential systems were closed down it was drifting in a remote area of the galaxy deep in the inky blackness of space so which particular hundred thousand people would turn up at this point and say a totally u nexpected wop he looked about him up the corridor and down the corridor it was all in deep shadow there were just the very dim pinkish outlines of the doors which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke though he had tried every way he co uld think of stopping them the lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each other because neither of them was currently a particularly engaging sight and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking into his soul it had i ndeed been an error it had been late one night ʹ of course it had been a difficult day ʹ of course there had been soulful music playing on the ships sound system ʹ of course and he had of course been slightly drunk in other words all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of soul­‐searching had applied but it had nevertheless clearly been an error standing now silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered the moment and shivered his one head looked o ne way and his other the other and each decided that the other was the way to go he listened but could hear nothing all there had been was the wop it seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of people just to say one word he st arted nervously to edge his way in the direction of the bridge there at least he would feel in control he stopped again the way he was feeling he didnt think he was an awfully good person to be in control the first shock of that moment thinking back had been discovering that he actually had a soul in fact hed always more or less assumed that he had one as he had a full complement of everything else and indeed two of somethings but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep with in him had giving him a severe jolt and then to discover this was the second shock that it wasnt the totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a natural right to expect had jolted him again then he had thought about what his p osition actually was and the renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink he drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it he then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right freedom he said al oud trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom i cant cope with it he said darkly and sent a third drink down to see why the second hadnt yet reported on the condition of the first he looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right he poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass join forces with it and together they would get the second to pull itself together then all three would go off in search of the first give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well he felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all that so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully an d a sixth for moral support youre drinking too much said trillian his heads collided trying to sort out the four of her he could now see into a whole position he gave up and looked at the navigation screen and was astonished to see a quite phenomenal number of stars excitement and adventure and really wild things h e muttered look she said in a sympathetic tone of voice and sat down near him its quite understandable that youre going to feel a little aimless for a bit he boggled at her he had never seen anyone sit on their own lap before wow he said he had another drink youve finished the mission youve been on for years i havent been on it ive tried to avoid being on it youve still finished it he grunted there seemed to be a terrific party going on in his stomach i think it f inished me he said here i am zaphod beeblebrox i can go anywhere do anything i have the greatest ship in the know sky a girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty well are they as far as i can tell im not an expert in personal relationships trillian raised her eyebrows i am he added one hell of a guy i can do anything i want only i just dont have the faintest idea what he paused one thing he further added has suddenly ceased to lead to another ʹ in contradiction of which he had another drink and slid gracelessly off his chair whilst he slept it off trillian did a little research in the ships copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy it had some advice to offer on drunkenness go to it it said and good luck it was cross ­‐referenced to the entry concerning the size of the universe and ways of coping with that then she found the entry on han wavel an exotic holiday planet and one of the wonders of the galaxy han wavel is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra ­‐luxury hotels and casinos all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and rain the chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity against little is known of how this came about becau se none of the geophysicists probability statisticians meteoranalysts or bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there terrific thought trillian to herself and within a few hours the great white running ­‐shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy spaceport the ship was clearly causing a sensation on the ground and trillian was enjoying herself she heard zaphod moving around and whistling somewhere in the s hip how are you she said over the general intercom fine he said brightly terribly well where are you in the bathroom what are you doing staying here after an hour or two it became plain that he meant it and the ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway heigh ho said eddie the computer trillian nodded patiently tapped her fingers a couple of times and pushed the intercom switch i think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this point probably not replied zaphod from wherever he was i think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you out of yourself whatever you think i think said zaphod recreational impossibilities was a heading which caught trillians eye wh en a short while later she sat down to flip through the guide again and as the heart of gold rushed at improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction she sipped a cup of something undrinkable from the nutrimatic drink dispenser and read about how to fly the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying there is an art it says or rather a knack to flying the knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss pick a nice day it suggests and try it the first part is easy all it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight and the willingness not to mind that its going to hurt that is its going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground most people fail to miss the ground and if they are really trying properly the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard clearly its the second point the missing which presents the difficulties one problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally its no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you wont you have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when youre halfway there so that you are no longer thinking about falling or about t he ground or about how much its going to hurt if you fail to miss it it is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal hence most peoples failure and their eventual dis illusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport if however you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by say a gorgeous pair of legs tentacles pseudopodia according to phyllum andor personal inclination or a bomb going off in your vicinity or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in wha t might seem to be a slightly foolish manner this is a moment for superb and delicate concentration bob and float float and bob ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful they are most likely to say something along the lines of good god you cant possibly be flying it is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right waft hig her and higher try a few swoops gentle ones at first then drift above the treetops breathing regularly do not wave at anybody when you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve you will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight your speed your manoeuvrability and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do but just allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway you will also learn how to land properly which is something you will almost certainly cock up and cock up badly on your first attempt there are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve the all ­‐important moment of distraction they hire p eople with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit andor explain them at the crucial moments few genuine hitch ­‐hikers will be able to afford to join these clubs but some may be able to get temporary employment at them trillian read this longingly but reluctantly decided that zaphod wasnt really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly or for walking through mountains or for trying to get the brantisvogan civil service to acknowledge a change ­‐of­‐address card which were the other things listed under the heading recreational impossibilities instead she flew the ship to allosimanius syneca a world of ice snow mind ­‐hurtling beauty and stunning cold the trek from the snow plains of liska to the summit of t he ice crystal pyramids of sastantua is long and gruelling even with jet skis and a team of syneca snowhounds but the view from the top a view which takes in the stin glacier fields the shimmering prism mountains and the far ethereal dancing icelights is one which first freezes the mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty and trillian for one felt that she could do with a bit of having her mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty they w ent into a low orbit there lay the silverwhite beauty of allosimanius syneca beneath them zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the other doing crosswords till late into the night trillian nodded patiently again counted to a su fficiently high number and told herself that the important thing now was just to get zaphod talking she prepared by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen synthomatics the most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive ʹ delicately oiled meals scented fruits fragrant cheeses fine aldebaran wines she carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking things through zark off said zaphod trillian nodded patiently to herself counted to an even higher number tossed the tray lightly aside walked to the transport room and just teleported herself the hell out of his life she didnt even programme any coordinates she hadnt the faintest id ea where she was going she just went ʹ a random row of dots flowing through the universe anything she said to herself as she left is better than this good job too muttered zaphod to himself turned over and failed to go to sleep the next da y he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship pretending not to look for her though he knew she wasnt there he ignored the computers querulous demands to know just what the hell was going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag across a pair of its terminals after a while he began to turn down the lights there was nothing to see nothing was about to happen lying in bed one night ʹ and night was now virtually continuous on the ship ʹ he decided to pull himself together to get thi ngs into some kind of perspective he sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on he decided that there must be someone in the universe feeling more wretched miserable and forsaken than himself and he determined to set out and find him halfway to th e bridge it occurred to him that it might be marvin and he returned to bed it was a few hours later than this as he stomped disconsolately about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors that he heard the wop said and it made him very nervo us he leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis he laid his fingertips against the wall and felt an unusual vibration and now he could quite clearly hear slight noises and could hear whe re they were coming from ʹ they were coming from the bridge computer he hissed mmmm said the computer terminal nearest him equally quietly is there someone on this ship mmmmm said the computer who is it mmmmm mmm mmmmm said the computer what mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands oh zarquon he muttered to himself then he stared up the corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance from which more and purposeful noises were coming and in which the gagged terminals were situated computer he hissed again mmmmm when i ungag you mmmmm remind me to punch myself in the mouth mmmmm mmm either one now just tell me this one for yes two for no is it dangerous mmmmm it is mmmm you didnt just go mmmm twice mmmm mmmm hmmmm he inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding his way down it which was true he was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he suddenly realized to his horror that it was going to be nice to him and he stopped dead he hadnt been able to turn off the doors courtesy voice circuits this doorway to the bridge was conceale d from view within it because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to curve round and he had been hoping to enter unobserved he leant despondently back against the wall again and said some words which his other head was qui te shocked to hear he peered at the dim pink outline of the door and discovered that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the sensor field which extended out into the corridor and told the door when there was someone there for wh om it must open and to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark he pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself towards the door flattening his chest as much as he possibly could to avoid brushing against the very very dim perimet er of the field he held his breath and congratulated himself on having lain in bed sulking for the last few days rather than trying to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ships gym he then realized he was going to have to speak at this poi nt he took a series of very shallow breaths and then said as quickly and as quietly as he could door if you can hear me say so very very quietly very very quietly the door murmured i can hear you good now in a moment im going to ask you to open when you open i do not want you to say that you enjoyed it ok ok and i dont want you to say to me that i have made a simple door very happy or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your satisfaction to close again with the kno wledge of a job well done ok ok and i do not want you to ask me to have a nice day understand i understand ok said zaphod tensing himself open now the door slid open quietly zaphod slipped quietly through the door closed quietly behind him is that the way you like it mr beeblebrox said the door out loud i want you to imagine said zaphod to the group of white robots who swung round to stare at him at that point that i have an extremely powerful kill ­‐o­‐zap blaster pis tol in my hand there was an immensely cold and savage silence the robots regarded him with hideously dead eyes they stood very still there was something intensely macabre about their appearance especially to zaphod who had never seen one before or e ven known anything about them the krikkit wars belonged to the ancient past of the galaxy and zaphod had spent most of his early history lessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him and since his teaching c omputer had been an integral part of this plot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely different set of ideas which had then resulted in it being scrapped and sent to a home for degenerate cybermats whither it wa s followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine with the result a that zaphod never got near her and b that he missed out on a period of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him a t this moment he stared at them in shock it was impossible to explain why but their smooth and sleek white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean clinical evil from their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet they were clea rly the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to kill zaphod gulped in cold fear they had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall and had forced a passage through some of the vital innards of the ship through the tangled wreckage zapho d could see with a further and worse sense of shock that they were tunnelling towards the very heart of the ship the heart of the improbability drive that had been so mysteriously created out of thin air the heart of gold itself the robot closest to him was regarding him in such a way as to suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his body mind and capability and when it spoke what it said seemed to bear this impression out before going on to what it actually said it is worth reco rding at this point that zaphod was the first living organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over ten billion years if he had paid more attention to his ancient history lessons and less to his organic being he might have been mor e impressed by this honour the robots voice was like its body cold sleek and lifeless it had almost a cultured rasp to it it sounded as ancient as it was it said you do have a kill ­‐o­‐zap blaster pistol in your hand zaphod didnt know what it meant for a moment but then he glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to a wall bracket was indeed what he had thought it was yeah he said in a kind of relieved sneer which is q uite tricky well i wouldnt want to overtax your imagination robot for a while nobody said anything and zaphod realized that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation and that it was up to him i cant help noticing that you have pa rked your ship he said with a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction through mine there was no denying this without regard for any kind of proper dimensional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship precisely where they wante d it to be which meant that it was simply locked through the heart of gold as if they were nothing more than two combs again they made no response to this and zaphod wondered if the conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of questions havent you he added yes replied the robot er ok said zaphod so what are you cats doing here silence robots said zaphod what are you robots doing here we have come rasped the robot for the go ld of the bail zaphod nodded he waggled his gun to invite further elaboration the robot seemed to understand this the gold bail is part of the key we seek continued the robot to release our masters from krikkit zaphod nodded again he waggle d his gun again the key continued the robot simply was disintegrated in time and space the golden bail is embedded in the device which drives your ship it will be reconstituted in the key our masters shall be released the universal readjustment will continue zaphod nodded again what are you talking about he said a slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robots totally expressionless face he seemed to be finding the conversation depressing obliteration it said we seek the key it repeated we already have the wooden pillar the steel pillar and the perspex pillar in a moment we will have the gold bail no you wont we will stated the robot no you wont it makes my ship work in a moment repeated the robot patiently we will have the gold bail you will not said zaphod and then we must go said the robot in all seriousness to a party oh said zaphod startled can i come no said the robot we are going to shoot you oh ye ah said zaphod waggling his gun yes said the robot and they shot him zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before he fell down chapter shhh said slartibartfast listen and watch night had now fallen on ancient krikkit the sky was dark and empty the only light was coming from the nearby town from which pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze they stood beneath a tree from which heady fragrances wafted arou nd them arthur squatted and felt the informational illusion of the soil and the grass he ran it through his fingers the soil seemed heavy and rich the grass strong it was hard to avoid the impression that this was a thoroughly delightful place in all respects the sky was however extremely blank and seemed to arthur to cast a certain chill over the otherwise idyllic if currently invisible landscape still he supposed its a question of what youre used to he felt a tap on his shoulder and look ed up slartibartfast was quietly directing his attention to something down the other side of the hill he looked and could just see some faint lights dancing and waving and moving slowly in their direction as they came nearer sounds became audible too and soon the dim lights and noises resolved themselves into a small group of people who were walking home across the hill towards the town they walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree swinging lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and grass chattering contentedly and actually singing a song about how terribly nice everything was how happy they were how m uch they enjoyed working on the farm and how pleasant it was to be going home to see their wives and children with a lilting chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling particularly nice at this time of year and that it was a pity the dog had die d seeing as it liked them so much arthur could almost imagine paul mccartney sitting with his feet up by the fire on evening humming it to linda and wondering what to buy with the proceeds and thinking probably essex the masters of krikkit breathed slartibartfast in sepulchral tones coming as it did so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about essex this remark caused arthur a moments confusion then the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind and he discovered that he still didnt understand what the old man meant what he said the masters of krikkit said slartibartfast again and if his breathing had been sepulchral before this time he sounded like someone in hades with bronchitis arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little information he had at his disposal at this point the people in the group were clearly alien if only because they seemed a little tall thin angular and almost as pale as to be white but otherwise they appeared r emarkably pleasant a little whimsical perhaps one wouldnt necessarily want to spend a long coach journey with them but the point was that if they deviated in any way from being good straightforward people it was in being perhaps too nice rather than no t nice enough so why all this rasping lungwork from slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them then this krikkit angle was a tough one t oo he hadnt quite fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket and what slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if sensing what was going through his mind the game you know as cricket he said and his voice s till seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time of all the races on the galaxy only the english could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the universe and transform it into what im afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game rather fond of it myself he added but in most peoples eyes you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesque bad taste particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket thats very nasty um said arthur with a reflective frown to indicate that his cognitive syna pses were coping with this as best as they could um and these said slartibartfast slipping back into crypt guttural and indicating the group of krikkit men who had now walked past them are the ones who started it all and it will start tonight come we will follow and see why they slipped out from underneath the tree and followed the cheery party along the dark hill path their natural instinct was to tread quietly and stealthily in pursuit of their quarry though as they were simply walki ng through a recorded informational illusion they could as easily have been wearing euphoniums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now singing a different song it came lilting back to them through the soft night air and was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted mccartney kent and essex and enabled him to put in a fa ir offer for hampshire you must surely know said slartibartfast to ford what it is that is about to happen me said ford no did you not learn ancient galactic history when you were a child i was in the cybercubicle behind zaphod sai d ford it was very distracting which isnt to say that i didnt learn some pretty stunning things at this point arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that the party were singing the middle eight bridge which would have had mccartney firmly c onsolidated in winchester and gazing intently over the test valley to the rich pickings of the new forest beyond had some curious lyrics the songwriter was referring to meeting with a girl not under the moon or beneath the stars but above the grass which struck arthur a little prosaic then he looked up again at the bewildering black sky and had the distinct feeling that there was an important point here if only he could grasp what it was it gave him a feeling of being alone in the universe and he said so no said slartibartfast with a slight quickening of his step the people of krikkit have never thought to themselves we are alone in the universe they are surrounded by a huge dust cloud you see their single sun with its single world and they are right out on the utmost eastern edge of the galaxy because of the dust cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky at night it is totally blank during the day there is the sun but you cant look directly at that so they dont they are hardly aware of the sky its as if they had a blind spot which extended degrees from horizon to horizon you see the reason why they have never thought we are alone in the universe is that until tonight they dont know about the universe until tonight he moved on leaving the words ringing in the air behind him imagine he said never even thinking we are alone simply because it has never occurred to you to think that theres any other way to be he moved on again im afra id this is going to be a little unnerving he added as he spoke they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high up in the sightless sky above them they glanced upwards in alarm but for a moment or two could see nothing then arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them had heard the noise but that none of them seemed to know what to do with it they were glancing around themselves in consternation left right forwards backwards even at the ground it never occurred to them t o look upwards the profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few moments later when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half a mile from where they were standing was something that y ou had to be there to experience some speak of the heart of gold in hushed tones some of the starship bistromath many speak of the legendary and gigantic starship titanic a majestic and luxurious cruise ­‐liner launched from the great shipbuilding ast eroid complexes of artifactovol some hundreds of years ago now and with good reason it was sensationally beautiful staggeringly huge and more pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history see note below on the campaign for real tim e but it had the misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of improbability physics long before this difficult and cussed branch of knowledge was fully or at all understood the designers and engineers decided in their innocence to build a prototype improbability field into it which was meant supposedly to ensure that it was infinitely improbable that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship they did not realize that because of the quasi ­‐reciprocal and circular nature of all improbability calculations anything that was infinitely improbable was actually very likely to happen almost immediately the starship titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay beached like a silver arcturan megavoidwhale amongst the laser ­‐lit tracery of its construction gantries a brilliant cloud of pins and needles of light against the deep interstellar blackness but when launched it did not even manage to complete its very first radio message ʹ an sos ʹ before undergoing a sudden and gratuit ous total existence failure however the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another it was conclusively proven that more people watched the tri ­‐d coverage of the launch than actuall y existed at the time and this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever in the science of audience research another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova which the star ysllodins underwent a few hours later ysllodins is the star around which most of the galaxys major insurance underwriters live or rather lived but whilst these spaceships and other great ones which come to mind such as the galactic fleet battleships ʹ the gss daring the gss audacy and the gss suici dal insanity ʹ are all spoken of with awe pride enthusiasm affection admiration regret jealousy resentment in fact most of the better known emotions the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was krikkit one the first spaceship ever built by the people of krikkit this is not because it was a wonderful ship it wasnt it was a crazy piece of near junk it looked as if it had been knocked up in somebodys backyard and this was in fact precisely where it had been knocked up th e astonishing thing about the ship was not that it was one well it wasnt but that it was done at all the period of time which had elapsed between the moment that the people of krikkit had discovered that there was such a thing as space and the launchin g of their first spaceship was almost exactly a year ford prefect was extremely grateful as he strapped himself in that this was just another informational illusion and that he was therefore completely safe in real life it wasnt a ship he would have set foot in for all the rice wine in china extremely rickety was one phrase which sprang to mind and please may i get out was another this is going to fly said arthur giving gaunt looks at the lashed ­‐ together pipework and wiring which festoo ned the cramped interior of the ship slartibartfast assured him that it would that they were perfectly safe and that it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a little harrowing ford and arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed why not said ford go mad in front of them and of course totally unaware of their presence for the very good reason that they werent actually there were the three pilots they had also constructed the ship they had been on the hill path that ni ght singing wholesome heartwarming songs their brains had been very slightly turned by the nearby crash of the alien spaceship they had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that burnt ­‐up spaceship all the while singing lilting spaceship ­‐stripping ditties they had then built their own ship and this was it this was their ship and they were currently singing a little song about that too expressing the twin joys of achievement and ownership the chorus was a little poign ant and told of their sorrow that their work had kept them such long hours in the garage away from the company of their wives and children who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful by bringing them continual stories of how nicely the puppy was growing up pow they took off they roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it was doing no way said ford a while later after they had recovered from the shock of acceleration and were climbing up out of the planets atmosphe re no way he repeated does anyone design and build a ship like this in a year no matter how motivated i dont believe it prove it to me and i still wont believe it he shook his head thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at the nothingness o utside it the trip passed uneventfully for a while and slartibartfast fastwound them through it very quickly therefore they arrived at the inner perimeter of the hollow spherical dust cloud which surrounded their sun and home planet occupying as it were the next orbit out it was more as if there was a gradual change in the texture and consistency of space the darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them it was a very cold darkness a very blank and heavy darkness it was the darkness of the night sky of krikkit the coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on arthurs heart and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the krikkit pilots which hung in the air like a thick static charge they were now on the very bounda ry of the historical knowledge of their race this was the very limit beyond which none of them had ever speculated or even known that there was any speculation to be done the darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship inside was the silence of history their historic mission was to find out if there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky from which the wrecked spaceship could have come another world maybe strange and incomprehensible though this thought was to the enclosed minds of th ose who had lived beneath the sky of krikkit history was gathering itself to deliver another blow still the darkness thrummed at them the blank enclosing darkness it seemed closer and closer thicker and thicker heavier and heavier and suddenly it was gone they flew out of the cloud they saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear for a while they flew on motionless against the starry sweep of the galaxy itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the universe and then they turned round itll have to go the men of krikkit said as they headed back for home on the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace justice morality culture sport family life and the obliteration of all other life forms chapter so you see said slartibartfast slowly stirring his artificially constructed coffee and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers between the interactive perceptions of mind and universe and thus generating the restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity which allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space how it is yes said arthur yes said ford what do i do said arthur with this piece of chicken slartibartfast glanced at him gravely toy with it he said toy with it he demonstrated with his own piece arthur did so and felt the slight tingle of a mathematical function thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four ­‐dimensionally through what slartibartfast had assured him was five ­‐dimensional space overnight said slartibartfast the whole population of krikkit was transformed from being charming delightful intelligent if whimsical interpolated arthur ordinary people said slartibartfast into charming delightful intelligent whimsical manic xenophobes the idea of a universe didnt fit into their world picture so to speak th ey simply couldnt cope with it and so charmingly delightfully intelligently whimsically if you like they decided to destroy it whats the matter now i dont like the wine very much said arthur sniffing it well send it back its all part of the mathematics of it arthur did so he didnt like the topography of the waiters smile but hed never liked graphs anyway where are we going said ford back to the room of informational illusions said slartibartfast rising and patting his mouth with the mathematical representation of a paper napkin for the second half chapter the people of krikkit said his high judgmental supremacy judiciary pag livr the learned impartial and very relaxed chairman of the board of judges at the krikkit war crimes trial are well you know theyre just a bunch of real sweet guys you know who just happen to want to kill everybody hell i feel t he same way some mornings shit ok he continued swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of him and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his ceremonial beach loafers so you wouldnt necessarily want to share a galaxy with these guys this w as true the krikkit attack on the galaxy had been stunning thousands and thousands of huge krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds first seizing vital material supplies f or building the next wave and then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence the galaxy which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and prosperity at the time reeled like a man getting mugged in a meadow i mean continued judiciary pag gazing round the ultra ­‐modern this was ten billion years ago when ultra ­‐modern meant lots of stainless steel and brushed concrete and huge courtroom these guys are just obsessed this too was true and is the onl y explanation anyone has yet managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose ʹ the destruction of everything that wasnt krikkit it is also the only explanation for their bewi ldering sudden grasp of all the hypertechnology involved in building their thousands of spaceships and their millions of lethal white robots these had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had encountered them ʹ in most cases however th e terror was extremely short ­‐lived as was the person experiencing the terror they were savage single ­‐minded flying battle machines they wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs which brandished one way would knock down buildings and brandished another way fired blistering omni ­‐destructo zap rays and brandished a third way launched a hideous arsenal of grenades ranging from minor incendiary devices to maxi ­‐slorta hypernuclear devices which could take out a major sun simply striking the gren ades with the battleclubs simultaneously primed them and launched them with phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to hundreds of thousands of miles ok said judiciary pag again so we won he paused and chewed a little gum we won he repeated but thats no big deal i mean a medium ­‐sized galaxy against one little world and how long did it take us clerk of the court mlud said the severe little man in black rising how long kiddo it is a trifle difficult mlu d to be precise in this matter time and distance relax guy be vague i hardly like to be vague mlud over such a bite the bullet and be it the clerk of the court blinked at him it was clear that like most of the galactic legal prof ession he found judiciary pag or zipo bibrok x as his private name was known inexplicably to be a rather distressing figure he was clearly a bounder and a cad he seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor of the finest legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to behave exactly as he liked and unfortunately he appeared to be right er well mlud very approximately two thousand years the clerk murmured unhappily and how many guys zilched out two grillion mlud t he clerk sat down a hydrospectic photo of him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly judiciary pag gazed once more around the courtroom wherein were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire galactic admini stration all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies depending on metabolism and custom behind a wall of zap ­‐proof crystal stood a representative group of the people of krikkit looking with calm polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgme nt on them this was the most momentous occasion in legal history and judiciary pag knew it he took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair thats a whole lotta stiffs he said quietly the grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord wi th this view so like i said these are a bunch of really sweet guys but you wouldnt want to share a galaxy with them not if theyre just gonna keep at it not if theyre not gonna learn to relax a little i mean its just gonna be continual nervous time isnt it right pow pow pow when are they next coming at us peaceful coexistence is just right out right get me some water somebody thank you he sat back and sipped reflectively ok he said hear me hear me its like these guys y ou know are entitled to their own view of the universe and according to their view which the universe forced on them right they did right sounds crazy but i think youll agree they believe in he consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of his judicial jeans they believe in peace justice morality culture sport family life and the obliteration of all other life forms he shrugged ive heard a lot worse he said he scratched his crotch reflectively freeeow he said he took another sip of water then held it up to the light and frowned at it he twisted it round hey is there something in this water he said er no mlud said the court usher who had brought it to him rather nervously then take it away snapped judiciary pag and put something in it i got an idea he pushed away the glass and leaned forward hear me hear me he said the solution was brilliant and went like this the planet of krikkit was to be enclosed for perpetuity in an envelope of slo ­‐time inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly all light would be deflected round the envelope so that it would remain invisible and impenetrable escape from the envelope would be utterly impossible unle ss it were locked from the outside when the rest of the universe came to its final end when the whole of creation reached its dying fall this was all of course in the days before it was known that the end of the universe would be a spectacular cateri ng venture and life and matter ceased to exist then the planet of krikkit and its sun would emerge from its slo ­‐time envelope and continue a solitary existence such as it craved in the twilight of the universal void the lock would be on an asteroid w hich would slowly orbit the envelope the key would be the symbol of the galaxy ʹ the wikkit gate by the time the applause in the court had died down judiciary pag was already in the sens ­‐o­‐shower with a rather nice member of the jury that hed slipped a note to half an hour earlier chapter two months later zipo bibrok x had cut the bottoms off his galactic state jeans and was spending part of the enormous fee his judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having essence of qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of the jury she was a soolfinian girl from beyond the cloudworlds of yaga she had skin like lemon silk and was very interested in legal bodies did you hear the news she said weeeeelaaaaah sai d zipo bibrok x and you would have had to have been there to know exactly why he said this none of this was on the tape of informational illusions and is all based on hearsay no he added when the thing that had made him say weeeeelaaaaah had stopped happening he moved his body round slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of primeval vods three suns which was now creeping over the ludicrously beautiful horizon and the sky now glittered with some of the greatest tanning p ower ever known a fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea trailed along the beach and drifted back to sea again wondering where to go next on a mad impulse it went up to the beach again it drifted back to sea i hope it isnt good news mu ttered zipo bibrok x cos i dont think i could bear it your krikkit judgment was carried out today said the girl sumptuously there was no need to say such a straightforward thing sumptuously but she went ahead and did it anyway because it wa s that sort of day i heard it on the radio she said when i went back to the ship for the oil uhuh muttered zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled sand something happened she said mmmm just after the slo ­‐time envelope was locked she said and paused a moment from rubbing in the essence of qualactin a krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned out to be just missing after all it appeared and tried to seize the key zipo sat up sharply hey what he said its all right she said in a voice which would have calmed the big bang down apparently there was a short battle the key and the warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space ­‐time continuum apparently they are lost for ever she smiled and ran a little more essence of qualactin on to her fingertips he relaxed and lay back down do what you did a moment or two ago he murmured that she said no no he said that she tried again that she asked weeeeelaaaaah again you had to be there the fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again a magician wandered along the beach but no one needed him chapter nothing is lost for ever said slartibartfast his face flickering redly in the light of the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take away except for the cathedral of chalesm the what said arthur with a start the cathedral of chalesm repeated slartibartfast it was during the course of my researches at the campaign for real time that i the what said arthur again the old man paused and gathered his thoughts for what he hoped would be one last onslaught on his story the rob ot waiter moved through the space ­‐time matrices in a way which spectacularly combined the surly with the obsequious made a snatch for the candle and got it they had had the bill had argued convincingly about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottl es of wine they had had and as arthur had been dimly aware had thereby successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into a parking orbit round a strange planet the waiter was now anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro all will become clear said slartibartfast when in a minute listen the time streams are now very polluted theres a lot of muck floating about in them flotsam and jetsam and more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world eddies in the space ­‐time continuum you see so i hear said arthur look where are we going said ford pushing his chair back from the table with impatience because im eager to get there we are going said slartibartfast in a slow measured voice to try to prevent the war robots of krikki t from regaining the whole of the key they need to unlock the planet of krikkit from the slo ­‐time envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad masters its just said ford that you mentioned a party i did said slartibartfast and hung his head he realized that it had been a mistake because the idea seemed to exercise a strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of ford prefect the more that slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic story of krikkit and its people the mo re ford prefect wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls the old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until he absolutely had to but there it was the fact was out and ford prefect had attached himself to it the way an arcturan megale ach attaches itself to its victim before biting his head off and making off with his spaceship when said ford eagerly do we get there when ive finished telling you why we have to go there i know why im going said ford and leaned back s ticking his hands behind his head he gave one of his smiles which made people twitch slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement he had been planning to learn to play the octraventral heebiephone ʹ a pleasantly futile task he knew because he had the wrong number of mouths he had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order to set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as important instead he had somehow got talked into doing some part ­‐time work for the campaign for real time and had started to take it all seriously for the first time in his life as a result he now found himself spending his fast ­‐declining years combating evil and trying to save the galax y he found it exhausting work and sighed heavily listen he said at camtim what said arthur the campaign for real time which i will tell you about later i noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times plopped back into existence seemed to correspond to the five pieces of the missing key only two i could trace exactly ʹ the wooden pillar which appeared on your planet and the silver bail it seems to be at some sort of party we must go there to retrieve it be fore the krikkit robots find it or who knows what may hap no said ford firmly we must go to the party in order to drink a lot and dance with girls but havent you understood everything i yes said ford with a sudden and unexpected fierceness ive understood it all perfectly well thats why i want to have as many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there are still any left if everything youve shown us is true true of course its true then we dont stand a whelks chance in a supernova a what said arthur sharply again he had been following the conversation doggedly up to this point and was keen not to lose the thread now a whelks chance in a supernova repeated ford without losing momentum the whats a whelk got to do with a supernova said arthur it doesnt said ford levelly stand a chance in one he paused to see if the matter was now cleared up the freshly puzzled look s clambering across arthurs face told him that it wasnt a supernova said ford as quickly and as clearly as he could is a star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as a super ­‐heavy neutron star its a star which burns up other s tars got it nothing stands a chance in a supernova i see said arthur the so why a whelk particularly why not a whelk doesnt matter arthur accepted this and ford continued picking up his early fierce momentum as best he could the point is he said that people like you and me slartibartfast and arthur ʹ particularly and especially arthur ʹ are just dilletantes eccentrics layabouts fartarounds if you like slartibartfast frowned partly in puzzlement and partly in umbra ge he started to speak ʹ is as far as he got were not obsessed by anything you see insisted ford and thats the deciding factor we cant win against obsession they care we dont they win i care about lots of things said slartibartfast his voice trembling partly with annoyance but partly also with uncertainty such as well said the old man life the universe everything really fjords would you die for them fjords blinked slartibartfast in surprise no well then wouldnt see the point to be honest and i still cant see the connection said arthur with whelks ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control and refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point the point is he hissed that we are not obsessive people and we dont stand a chance against except for your sudden obsession with whelks pursued arthur which i still havent understood will you please leave whelks out of it i will if yo u will said arthur you brought the subject up it was an error said ford forget them the point is this he leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers what was i talking about he said wearily lets just go down to the party said slartibartfast for whatever reason he stood up shaking his head i think thats what i was trying to say said ford for some unexplained reason the teleport cubicles were in the bathroom chapter time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace history is being polluted the encyclopedia galactica has much to say on the theory and practice of time travel most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasnt spent at least four lifetimes studyin g advanced hypermathematics and since it was impossible to do this before time travel was invented there is a certain amount of confusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place one rationalization of this problem states that time travel wa s by its very nature discovered simultaneously at all periods of history but this is clearly bunk the trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well here is an example it may not seem to be an important one to some people but t o others it is crucial it is certainly significant in that it was the single event which caused the campaign for real time to be set up in the first place or is it last it depends which way round you see history as happening and this too is now an incr easingly vexed question there is or was a poet his name was lallafa and he wrote what are widely regarded throughout the galaxy as being the finest poems in existence the songs of the long land they arewere unspeakably wonderful that is to say you couldnt speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with emotion truth and a sense of wholeness and oneness of things that you wouldnt pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a quic k glass of perspective and soda they were that good lallafa had lived in the forests of the long lands of effa he lived there and he wrote his poems there he wrote them on pages made of dried habra leaves without the benefit of education or correcti ng fluid he wrote about the light in the forest and what he thought about that he wrote about the darkness in the forest and what he thought about that he wrote about the girl who had left him and precisely what he thought about that long after his d eath his poems were found and wondered over news of them spread like morning sunlight for centuries they illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might otherwise have been darker and drier then shortly after the invention of time t ravel some major correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he had had access to some high ­‐quality correcting fluid and whether he might be persuaded to say a few words on that effect they travelled the ti me waves they found him they explained the situation ʹ with some difficulty ʹ to him and did indeed persuade him in fact they persuaded him to such an effect that he became extremely rich at their hands and the girl about whom he was otherwise destine d to write which such precision never got around to leaving him and in fact they moved out of the forest to a rather nice pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat shows on which he sparkled wittily he never got around to writing the poems of course which was a problem but an easily solved one the manufacturers of correcting fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere with a copy of a later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to makin g the odd deliberate mistake and correction on the way many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless others argue that they are exactly the same as they always were so whats changed the first people say that that isnt the point they arent quite sure what the point is but they are quite sure that that isnt it they set up the campaign for real time to try to stop this sort of thing going on their case was considerably strengthened by the fact that a week after they had set themselves up news broke that not only had the great cathedral of chalesm been pulled down in order to build a new ion refinery but that the construction of the refinery had taken so long and had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow ion produc tion to start on time that the cathedral of chalesm had now never been built in the first place picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable so a lot of history is now gone for ever the campaign for real timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences between one country and another and between one world and another so time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and another the past they say is now truly like a foreign country they do things exactly the same there chapter arthur materialized and did so with all the customary staggering about and clasping at his throat heart and various limbs which he still indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and painful mat erializations that he was determined not to let himself get used to he looked around for the others they werent there he looked around for the others again they still werent there he closed his eyes he opened them he looked around for the others they obstinately persisted in their absence he closed his eyes again preparatory to making this completely futile exercise once more and because it was only then whilst his eyes were closed that his brain began to re gister what his eyes had been looking at whilst they were open a puzzled frown crept across his face so he opened his eyes again to check his facts and the frown stayed put if anything it intensified and got a good firm grip if this was a party it was a very bad one so bad in fact that everybody else had left he abandoned this line of thought as futile obviously this wasnt a party it was a cave or a labyrinth or a tunnel of something ʹ there was insufficient light to tell all was darkness a damp shiny darkness the only sounds were the echoes of his own breathing which sounded worried he coughed very slightly and then had to listen to the thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding corridors and sightless chambers as o f some great labyrinth and eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors as if to say yes this happened to every slightest noise he made and it unnerved him he tried to hum a cheery tune but by the time it returned to him it was a h ollow dirge and he stopped his mind was suddenly full of images from the story that slartibartfast had been telling him he half ­‐expected suddenly to see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill him he caught his breath they didnt he let it go again he didnt know what he did expect someone or something however seemed to be expecting him for at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign it said silently you have been diverted the sign flicked off again in a way which arthur was not at all certain he liked it flicked off with a sort of contemptuous flourish arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just a ridiculous trick of his imagination a neon sign is either on o r off depending on whether it has electricity running through it or not there was no way he told himself that it could possibly effect the transition from one state to the other with a contemptuous flourish he hugged himself tightly in his dressing go wn and shivered nevertheless the neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up bafflingly with just three dots and a comma like this only in green neon it was trying arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly for a second or two to i ndicate that there was more to come that the sentence was not complete trying with almost superhuman pedantry he reflected or at least inhuman pedantry the sentence then completed itself with these two words arthur dent he reeled he steadied hi mself to have another clear look at it it still said arthur dent so he reeled again once again the sign flicked off and left him blinking in the darkness with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his retina welcome the sign now suddenly s aid after a moment it added i dont think the stone ­‐cold fear which had been hovering about arthur all this time waiting for its moment recognized that its moment had now come and pounced on him he tried to fight it off he dropped into a kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television but it must have been someone with stronger knees he peered huntedly into the darkness er hello he said he cleared his throat and said it again more loudly and without the er at some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if somebody started to beat on a bass drum he listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just his heart bea ting he listened for a few seconds more and realized that it wasnt his heart beating it was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass drum beads of sweat formed on his brow tensed themselves and leapt off he put a hand out on the floor to stead y his alert crouch which wasnt holding up very well the sign changed itself again it said do not be alarmed after a pause it added be very very frightened arthur dent once again it flicked off once again it left him in darkness his eyes seemed to be popping out of his head he wasnt certain if this was because they were trying to see more clearly or if they simply wanted to leave at this point hello he said again this time trying to put a note of rugged and aggressive self ­‐assertion into it is anyone there there was no reply nothing this unnerved arthur dent even more than a reply would have done and he began to back away from the scary nothingness and the more he backed away the more scared he became after a while he real ized that the reason for this was because of all the films he had seen in which the hero backs further and further away from some imagined terror in front of him only to bump into it coming up from behind just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn ro und rather quickly there was nothing there just blackness this really unnerved him and he started to back away from that back the way he had come after doing this for a short while it suddenly occurred to him that he was now backing towards whate ver it was he had been backing away from in the first place this he couldnt help thinking must be a foolish thing to do he decided he would be better off backing the way he had first been backing and turned around again it turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the correct one because there was an indescribably hideous monster standing quietly behind him arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to jump one way and his skeleton the other whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of bet you werent expecting to see me again said the monster which arthur couldnt help thinking was a strange remark for it to make seeing as he had never met the creature before he could tell that he hadnt met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights it was it was it was arthur blinked at it it stood very still it did look a little familiar a terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was looking at was a six ­‐foot­‐high hologram of a housefly he wondered why anybody would be showing him a six ­‐foot­‐high hologram of a housefly at this time he wondered whose voice he had heard it was a terribly realistic hologram it vanished or perhaps you remember me better said the voice suddenly and it was a deep hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind as the rabbit with a sudden ping there was a rabbit there in the black labyrinth with him a huge monstrously hideously soft and lovable rabbit ʹ an image again but one on which every single soft and lovable hair seemed like a real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat arthur was startled to see his own reflection i n its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge brown eyes born in darkness rumbled the voice raised in darkness one morning i poked my head for the first time into the bright new world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some primitive instrument made of flint made by you arthur dent and wielded by you rather hard as i recall you turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in i happen to know that because in my next life i came back as a fly again and yo u swatted me again only this time you swatted me with the bag youd made of my previous skin arthur dent you are not merely a cruel and heartless man you are also staggeringly tactless the voice paused whilst arthur gawped i see you have lost the bag said the voice probably got bored with it did you arthur shook his head helplessly he wanted to explain that he had been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and had taken it with him wherever he went but that somehow every time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with the wrong bag and that curiously enough even as they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at the moment appeared to be made out of rather nasty fake leopard skin and wasnt the one hed had a few moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was and wasnt one he would have chosen himself and heaven knew what would be in it as it wasnt his and he would much rather have his original bag back except that he was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it or rather its component parts ie the rabbit skin from its previous owner viz the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of attempting vainly to address all he actually managed to say was erp meet the newt you trod on said the voice and there was standing in the corridor with arthur a giant green scaly newt arthur turned yelped leapt backwards and found himself standing in the middle of the rabbit he yelped again but could find nowhere to leap to that was me too continued the voice in a low menacing rumble as if you didnt know know said arthur with a start know the interesting thing about reincarnation rasped the voice is that most people most spirits are not aware that it is happening to them he paused for effect as far as arthur was concerned there was already quite enough effect going on i was aware hissed the voice that is i became aware slowly gradually he whoever he was paused again and gathered breath i could hardly help it could i he bellowed when the same thing kept happening over and over and over again every life i ever lived i got killed by art hur dent any world any body any time im just getting settled down along comes arthur dent ʹ pow he kills me hard not to notice bit of a memory jogger bit of a pointer bit of a bloody giveaway thats funny my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way back to the netherworld after another fruitless dent ­‐ended venture into the land of the living that man who just ran over me as i was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a little familiar and gradually i got to piec e it together dent you multiple ­‐ me­‐murderer the echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors arthur stood silent and cold his head shaking with disbelief heres the moment dent shrieked the voice now reaching a feverish pitch of hatre d heres the moment when at last i knew it was indescribably hideous the thing that suddenly opened up in front of arthur making him gasp and gargle with horror but heres an attempt at a description of how hideous it was it was a huge palpitating wet cave with a vast slimy rough whale ­‐like creature rolling around it and sliding over monstrous white tombstones high above the cave rose a vast promontory in which could be seen the dark recesses of two further fearful caves which arthur dent suddenly realized that he was looking at his own mouth when his attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it he staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes when he looked again the appalling apparit ion had gone the corridor was dark and briefly silent he was alone with his thoughts they were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would rather have had a chaperone the next noise when it came was the low heavy roll of a large section of wall trundl ing aside revealing for the moment just dark blackness behind it arthur looked into it in much the same way that a mouse looks into a dark dog ­‐kennel and the voice spoke to him again tell me it was a coincidence dent it said i dare you to tel l me it was a coincidence it was a coincidence said arthur quickly it was not came the answering bellow it was said arthur it was if it was a coincidence then my name roared the voice is not agrajag and presumably said arthur you would claim that that was your name yes hissed agrajag as if he had just completed a rather deft syllogism well im afraid it was still a coincidence said arthur come in here and say that howled the voi ce in sudden apoplexy again arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence or at least he nearly said that it was a coincidence his tongue rather lost its footing towards the end of the last word because the lights came up and revealed what it w as he had walked into it was a cathedral of hate it was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted but actually sprained it was huge it was horrific it had a statue in it we will come to the statue in a moment the vast incomprehensibl y vast chamber looked as if it had been carved out of the inside of a mountain and the reason for this was that that was precisely what it had been carved out of it seemed to arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it it was black where it wasnt black you were inclined to wish that it was because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eye ­‐defying colours from ultra violent to infra dead taking in liver purple loathsome lilac matter yellow burnt hombre and gan green on the way the unspeakable details which these colours picked out were gargoyles which would have put francis bacon off his lunch the gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls from the pillars from the flying buttresses from the choir stalls towards the statue to which we will come in a moment and if the gargoyles would have put francis bacon off his lunch then it was clear from the gargoyles faces that the statue would have put them off theirs had they been alive to eat it which they werent and had anybody tried to serve them some which they wouldnt around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in memory of those who had fallen to arthur dent the names of some of those commemorated were underlined and had asterisks against them so for instance the name of a cow which had been slaughtered and of which arthur dent had happened to eat a fillet steak would have the plainest engraving whereas th e name of a fish which arthur had himself caught and then decided he didnt like and left on the side of the plate had a double underlining three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added as decoration just to make the point and what was most distu rbing about all this apart from the statue to which we are by degrees coming was the very clear implication that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person over and over again and it was equally clear that this person was however u nfairly extremely upset and annoyed in fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the universe it was an annoyance of epic proportions a burning searing flame of annoyance an annoyan ce which now spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage and this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the statue in the centre of all this monstrosity which was a statue of arthur dent and an unflattering one fifty feet tall if it was an inch there was not an inch of it which wasnt crammed with insult to its subject matter and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad from the small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown there was no aspect of arthur dent which wasnt lambasted and vilified by the sculptor arthur appeared as a gorgon an evil rapacious ravenning bloodied ogre slaughtering his way through an innocent one ­‐man universe with each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a fit of artistic fervour had decided to give him he was either braining a rabbit swatting a fly pulling a wishbone picking a flea out of his hair or doing something which arthur at first looking couldnt quite identify his many feet were mostly stamping on ants arthur put his hands over his eyes hung his head and shook it slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things and when he opened his eyes again there in front of him sto od the figure of the man or creature or whatever it was that he had supposedly been persecuting all this time hhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaahhhhhh said agrajag he or it or whatever looked like a mad fat bat he waddled slowly around arthur and poked at hi m with bent claws look protested arthur hhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaahhhhhh explained agrajag and arthur reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition agrajag was black bloated wrinkled and leathery his batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken floundering things they were that if they had been strong muscular beaters of the air the frightening thing was probably the tena city of his continued existence against all the physical odds he had the most astounding collection of teeth they looked as if they each came from a completely different animal and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed tha t if he ever actually tried to chew anything hed lacerate half his own face along with it and possibly put an eye out as well each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as sane as a fish in a privet bush i was at a cricket match he rasped this seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that arthur practically choked not in this body screeched the creature not in this body this is my last body my last life this is my revenge body my kill ­‐arthur ­‐ dent body my last chance i had to fight to get it too but i was at roared agrajag a cricket match i had a weak heart condition but what i said to my wife can happen to me at a cricket match as im watching what happens two people quite maliciou sly appear out of thin air just in front of me the last thing i cant help but notice before my poor heart gives out in shock is that one of them is arthur dent wearing a rabbit bone in his beard coincidence yes said arthur coincidence screame d the creature painfully thrashing its broken wings and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a particularly nasty tooth on closer examination such as hed been hoping to avoid arthur noticed that much of agrajags face was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters he backed away nervously he tugged at his beard he was appalled to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it he pulled it out and threw it away look he said its just fate playing silly buggers wit h you with me with us its a complete coincidence what have you got against me dent snarled the creature advancing on him in a painful waddle nothing insisted arthur honestly nothing agrajag fixed him with a beady stare seems a str ange way to relate to somebody youve got nothing against killing them all the time very curious piece of social interaction i would call that id also call it a lie but look said arthur im very sorry theres been a terrible misunderstanding ive got to go have you got a clock im meant to be helping save the universe he backed away still further agrajag advanced still further at one point he hissed at one point i decided to give up yes i would not come back i would stay in t he netherworld and what happened arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no idea and didnt want to have one either he found he had backed up against the cold dark stone that had been carved by who knew what herculean effort into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers he glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image towering above him he was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was meant to be doing i got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world pursue d agrajag as a bunch of petunias in i might add a bowl this particularly happy little lifetime started off with me in my bowl unsupported three hundred miles above the surface of a particularly grim planet not a naturally tenable position for a b owl of petunias you might think and youd be right that life ended a very short while later three hundred miles lower in i might add the fresh wreckage of a whale my spirit brother he leered at arthur with renewed hatred on the way down he snarled i couldnt help noticing a flashy ­‐ looking white spaceship and looking out of a port on this flashy ­‐ looking spaceship was a smug ­‐looking arthur dent coincidence yes yelped arthur he glanced up again and realized that the arm that had p uzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence a bowl of doomed petunias this was not a concept which leapt easily to the eye i must go insisted arthur you may go said agrajag after i have killed you no that wont be any use explained arthur beginning to climb up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper because i have to save the universe you see i have to find a silver bail thats the point tricky thing to do dead save the universe spat agrajag with contempt you should have thought of that before you started your vendetta against me what about the time you were on stavromula beta and someone ive never been there said arthur tried to assassinate you and you ducked who do you think the bullet hit what did you say never been there repeated arthur what are you talking about i have to go agrajag stopped in his tracks you must have been there you were respons ible for my death there as everywhere else an innocent bystander he quivered ive never heard of the place insisted arthur ive certainly never had anyone try to assassinate me other than you perhaps i go there later do you think agrajag b linked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror you havent been to stavromula beta yet he whispered no said arthur i dont know anything about the place certainly never been to it and dont have any plans to go oh you go there all r ight muttered agrajag in a broken voice you go there all right oh zark he tottered and stared wildly about him at his huge cathedral of hate ive brought you here too soon he started to scream and bellow ive brought you here too zarking soo n suddenly he rallied and turned a baleful hating eye on arthur im going to kill you anyway he roared even if its a logical impossibility im going to zarking well try im going to blow this whole mountain up he screamed lets see you ge t out of this one dent he rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be a small black sacrificial altar he was shouting so wildly now that he was really carving his face up badly arthur leaped down from his vantage place on the carving o f his own foot and ran to try to restrain the three ­‐quarters ­‐crazed creature he leaped upon him and brought the strange monstrosity crashing down on top of the altar agrajag screamed again thrashed wildly for a brief moment and turned a wild eye on arthur you know what youve done he gurgled painfully youve only gone and killed me again i mean what do you want from me blood he thrashed again in a brief apoplectic fit quivered and collapsed smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so arthur started with horror and fear first at what he appeared to have done and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly shattered the air to announce some clamouring emergency he stared wildly around him the only exit appeared to be the way he came in he pelted towards it throwing away the nasty fake leopard ­‐skin bag as he did so he dashed randomly haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze he seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons sirens flashing lights sudd enly he turned a corner and there was a light in front of him it wasnt flashing it was daylight chapter although it has been said that on earth alone in our galaxy is krikkit or cricket treated as fit subject for a game and that for this reason the earth has been shunned this does only apply to our galaxy and more specifically to our dimension in some of the higher dimensions they feel they can more or less please themselves and have been playing a peculiar game called brockian ultra ­‐cricket for whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years is lets be blunt its a nasty game sa ys the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy but then anyone who has been to any of the higher dimensions will know that theyre a pretty nasty heathen lot up there who should just be smashed and done in and would be too if anyone could work out a way of f iring missiles at right ­‐angles to reality this is another example of the fact that the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the street and get ripped off especially if they happen to walk in off the street during the afternoon when very few of the regular staff are there there is a fundamental point here the history of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is one of idealism struggle despair passion success failure and enormously long lunch ­‐breaks the earliest origins of the guide are now along with most of its financial records lost in the mists of time for other and more curious theories about where they are lost see below most of the surviving stories however speak of a founding e ditor called hurling frootmig hurling frootmig it is said founded the guide established its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and went bust there followed many years of penury and heart ʹ searching during which he consulted friends sa t in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind thought about this and that fooled about with weights and then after a chance encounter with the holy lunching friars of voondon who claimed that just as lunch was at the centre of a mans temporal day an d mans temporal day could be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life so lunch should a be seen as the centre of a mans spiritual life and b be held in jolly nice restaurants he refounded the guide laid down its fundamental principles of hone sty and idealism and where you could stuff them both and led the guide on to its first major commercial success he also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial lunch ­‐break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the guide s history since it meant that most of the actual work got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing shortly after this the guide was taken over by megadodo publications of u rsa minor beta thus putting the whole thing on a very sound financial footing and allowing the fourth editor lig lury jr to embark on lunch ­‐breaks of such breathtaking scope that even the efforts of recent editors who have started undertaking sponsore d lunch ­‐breaks for charity seem like mere sandwiches in comparison in fact lig never formally resigned his editorship ʹ he merely left his office late one morning and has never since returned though well over a century has now passed many members of the guide staff still retain the romantic notion that he has simply popped out for a ham croissant and will yet return to put in a solid afternoons work strictly speaking all editors since lig lury jr have therefore been designated acting editors and ligs desk is still preserved the way he left it with the addition of a small sign which says lig lury jr editor missing presumed fed some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that lig actually perished in the guides first extraordinary experiments in alternative book ­‐keeping very little is known of this and less still said anyone who even notices let alone calls attention to the curious but utter coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster is liable to get sued to smithereens it is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or three days prior to the demolition of the planet earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of ufo sightings there not only above lords cricket groun d in st johns wood london but also above glastonbury in somerset glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings witchcraft ley ­‐lines an wart curing and had now been selected as the site for the new hitchhikers guide financial re cords office and indeed ten years worth of financial records were transferred to a magic hill just outside the city mere hours before the vogons arrived none of these facts however strange or inexplicable is as strange or inexplicable as the rules o f the game of brockian ultra ­‐cricket as played in the higher dimensions a full set of rules is so massively complicated that the only time they were all bound together in a single volume they underwent gravitational collapse and became a black hole a brief summary however is as follows rule one grow at least three extra legs you wont need them but it keeps the crowds amused rule two find one good brockian ultra ­‐cricket player clone him off a few times this saves an enormous amount of tedio us selection and training rule three put your team and the opposing team in a large field and build a high wall round them the reason for this is that though the game is a major spectator sport the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see whats going on leads them to imagine that its a lot more exciting than it really is a crowd that has j ust watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life ­‐affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history rule four throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over the wall for the players anything will do ʹ cricket bats basecube bats tennis guns skis anything you can get a good swing with rule five the players should now lay about themselves for all they are worth with whatever they find to hand whenever a player scores a hit on another player he should immediately run away and apologize from a safe distance apologies should be concise sincere and for maximum clarity and points delivered through a megaphone rule six the winning team shall be the first team that wins curiously enough the more the obsession with the game grows in the higher dimensions the less it is actually played since most of the competing teams are now in a state of permanent warfare with each other over the interpretation of these rules this is a ll for the best because in the long run a good solid war is less psychologically damaging than a protracted game of brockian ultra ­‐cricket chapter as arthur ran darting dashing and panting down the side of the mountain he suddenly felt the who le bulk of the mountain move very very slightly beneath him there was a rumble a roar and a slight blurred movement and a lick of heat in the distance behind and above him he ran in a frenzy of fear the land began to slide and he suddenly felt the force of the word landslide in a way which had never been apparent to him before it had always just been a word to him but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing for land to do it was doing it with him on it he felt ill with fear and shaking the ground slid the mountain slurred he slipped he fell he stood he slipped again and ran the avalance began stones then rocks then boulders which pranced past him like clumsy puppies only much much bigger much much harder and heavier and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you his eyes danced with them his feet danced with the dancing ground he ran as if running was a terrible sweating sickness his heart pounded to the rhythm o f the pounding geological frenzy around him the logic of the situation ie that he was clearly bound to survive if the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of agrajag was to happen was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this time he ran with the fear of death in him under him over him and grabbing hold of his hair and suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his considerable momentum but just at the moment that he was about to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of him a small navy ­‐blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage ­‐retrieval system at athens airport some ten years in his personal time ­‐scale previously and in his astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing what he was doing was this he was flying he glanced around him in surprise but there could be no doubt that that was what he was doing no part of him was touching the ground and no part of him was even approaching it he was simply floating there with boulders hurtling through the air around him he could now do something about that blinking with the non ­‐ effort of it he wafted hi gher into the air and now the boulders were hurtling through the air beneath him he looked downwards with intense curiosity between him and the shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air empty that is if you discounted the boulders which didnt stay in it for long but bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity the same law which seemed all of a sudden to have given arthur a sabbatical it occurred to him almost instantly with the instinctive correctness that self ­‐preser vation instils in the mind that he mustnt try to think about it that if he did the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up there and all would suddenly be lost so he t hought about tulips it was difficult but he did he thought about the pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of tulips he thought about the interesting variety of colours they came in and wondered what proportion of the total number of tulips that grew or had grown on the earth would be found within a radius of one mile from a windmill after a while he got dangerously bored with this train of thought felt the air slipping away beneath him felt that he was drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not to think about so he thought about athens airport for a bit and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes ʹ at the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating about two hundred yar ds above the ground he wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again and tried to look at the situation steadily he was flying what was he going to do about it he looked b ack down at the ground he didnt look at it hard but did his best just to give it an idle glance as it were in passing there were a couple of things he couldnt help noticing one was that the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have spent itself ʹ there was a crater just a little way beneath the peak presumably where the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous cathedral the statue of himself and the sadly abused figure of agrajag the other was his hold ­‐all the one he had lost at athens airport it was sitting pertly on a piece of clear ground surrounded by exhausted boulders but apparently hit by none of them why this should be he could not speculate but since this mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility of the bags being there in the first place it was not a speculation he really felt strong enough for anyway the thing is it was there and the nasty fake leopard ­‐skin bag seemed to have disappeared which was all to the good if not entirely to the expl icable he was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the thing up here he was flying along two hundred yards above the surface of an alien planet the name of which he couldnt even remember he could not ignore the plaintive posture of t his tiny piece of what used to be his life here so many light ­‐years from the pulverized remains of his home furthermore he realized the bag if it was still in the state in which he lost it would contain a can which would have in it the only greek olive oil still surviving in the universe slowly carefully inch by inch he began to bob downwards swinging gently from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper feeling its way towards the ground it went well he was feeling good the air supported him but let him through two minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet above the bag and was faced with some difficult decision he bobbed there lightly he frowned but again as lightly as he cou ld if he picked the bag up could he carry it mightnt the extra weight just pull him straight to the ground mightnt the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air mightnt he be better off just being sensible at this point and stepping out of the air back on to the ground f or a moment or two if he did would he ever be able to fly again the sensation when he allowed himself to be aware of it was so quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it perhaps for ever with this worry in mind he bobbed upwa rds a little again just to try the feel of it the surprising and effortless movement of it he bobbed he floated he tried a little swoop the swoop was terrific with his arms spread out in front of him his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him he dived down out of the sky bellied along a body of air about two feet from the ground and swung back up again catching himself at the top of the swing and holding just holding he stayed there it was wonderful and that he realized was the way of picking up the bag he would swoop down and catch hold of it just at the point of the upswing he would carry it on up with him he might wobble a bit but he was certain that he could hold it he tried one or two more practice swoops and they got better and better the air on his face the bounce and woof of his body all combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadnt felt since since ʹ well as far as he could work out since he was born he drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the countryside which was he discovered pretty nasty it had a wasted ravaged look he decided not to look at it any more he would just pick up the bag and then he didnt know what he was going to do after he had picked up the bag he decid ed he would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there he judged himself against the wind pushed up against it and turned around he floated on its body he didnt realize but his body was willoming at this point he ducked down under t he airstream dipped ʹ and dived the air threw itself past him he thrilled through it the ground wobbled uncertainly straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly up to meet him offering the bag its cracked plastic handles up towards him halfway do wn there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no longer believe he was doing this and therefore he very nearly wasnt but he recovered himself in time skimmed over the ground slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag and began to c limb back up couldnt make it and all of a sudden collapsed bruised scratched and shaking in the stony ground he staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around swinging the bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment his feet suddenly were stuck heavily to the ground in the way they always had been his body seemed like an unwieldy sack of potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground his mind had all the lightness of a bag of lead he sagged and swayed and ached with gi ddiness he tried hopelessly to run but his legs were suddenly too weak he tripped and flopped forward at that moment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not only a can of greek olive oil but a duty ­‐ free allowance of retsina and in th e pleasurable shock of that realization he failed to notice for at least ten seconds that he was now flying again he whooped and cried with relief and pleasure and sheer physical delight he swooped he wheeled he skidded and whirled through the air c heekily he sat on an updraught and went through the contents of the hold ­‐all he felt the way he imagined an angel must feel during its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst being counted by philosophers he laughed with pleasure at the discovery th at the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and the retsina as well as a pair of cracked sunglasses some sand ­‐filled swimming trunks some creased postcards of santorini a large and unsightly towel some interesting stones and various scraps of paper w ith the addresses of people he was relieved to think he would never meet again even if the reason why was a sad one he dropped the stones put on the sunglasses and let the pieces of paper whip away in the wind ten minutes later drifting idly through a cloud he got a large and extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back chapter the longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its fourth generation and still no one shows any signs of leaving somebody did once look at his watch but that was eleven years ago and there has been no follow ­‐up the mess is extraordinary and has to be seen to be believed but if you dont have any particular need to believe it then dont go and look because you wont enjoy it there have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the fleets of several rival carpet ­‐cleaning companies who are hovering over the thing like vultures but you shouldnt beli eve anything you hear at parties and particularly not anything you hear at this one one of the problems and its one which is obviously going to get worse is that all the people at the party are either the children or the grandchildren or the great ­‐grandchildren of the people who wouldnt leave in the first place and because of all the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so on it means that all the people now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers or gibbering idiots or more and more frequently both either way it means that genetically sp eaking each succeeding generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one so other factors come into operation like when the drink is going to run out now because of certain things which have happened which seemed like a good idea at the time and one of the problems with a party which never stops is that all the things which only seem like a good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas that point seems still to be a long way off one of the things which seemed like a good idea at the time was that the party should fly ʹ not in the normal sense that parties are meant to fly but literally one night long ago a band of drunken astro ­‐engineers of the first generation clambered round the building digging this fixing that bangi ng very hard on the other and when the sun rose the following morning it was startled to find itself shining on a building full of happy drunken people which was now floating like a young and uncertain bird over the treetops not only that but the flyin g party had also managed to arm itself rather heavily if they were going to get involved in any petty arguments with wine merchants they wanted to make sure they had might on their side the transition from full ­‐time cocktail party to part ­‐time raiding party came with ease and did much to add that extra bit of zest and swing to the whole affair which was badly needed at this point because of the enormous number of times that the band had already played all the numbers it knew over the years they loote d they raided they held whole cities for ransom for fresh supplies of cheese crackers avocado dip spare ribs and wine and spirits which would now get piped aboard from floating tankers the problem of when the drink is going to run out is however going to have to be faced one day the planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet it was when they first started floating over it it is in bad shape the party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it and no one has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky it is one hell of a party it is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back chapter arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and dismembered reinforced concrete flicked at by wisps of passing cloud and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere indistinctly behind him there was a sound he couldnt immediately ide ntify partly because he didnt know the tune i left my leg in jaglan beta and partly because the band playing it were very tired and some members of it were playing it in three ­‐four time some in four ­‐four and some in a kind of pie ­‐eyed r each accor ding to the amount of sleep hed managed to grab recently he lay panting heavily in the wet air and tried feeling bits of himself to see where he might be hurt wherever he touched himself he encountered a pain after a short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that was hurting he seemed to have sprained his wrist his back too was hurting but he soon satisfied himself that he was not badly hurt but just bruised and a little shaken as who wouldnt be he couldnt understand what a building would be doing flying through the clouds on the other hand he would have been a little hard ­‐pressed to come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence so he decided that he and the building were just going to have to accept each other he looked up from where he was lying a wall of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him the building proper he seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way ar ound it was a hunk of the ground in which the party building had had its foundations and which it had taken along with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end nervously he stood up and suddenly looking out over the edge he felt nause ous with vertigo he pressed himself back against the wall wet with mist and sweat his head was swimming freestyle but someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly even though he had got up here under his own power he could now not even bear to con template the hideous drop in front of him he was not about to try his luck jumping he was not about to move an inch closer to the edge clutching his hold ­‐all he edged along the wall hoping to find a doorway in the solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great reassurance to him he was edging in the direction of the nearest corner in the hope that the wall around the corner might o ffer more in the way of entrances than this one which offered none the unsteadiness of the buildings flight made him feel sick with fear and after a short while he took the towel from out of his hold ­‐all and did something with it which once again just ified its supreme position in the list of useful things to take with you when you hitch ­‐ hike round the galaxy he put it over his head so he wouldnt have to see what he was doing his feet edged along the ground his outstretched hand edged along the wal l finally he came to the corner and as his hand rounded the corner it encountered something which gave him such a shock that he nearly fell straight off it was another hand the two hands gripped each other he desperately wanted to use his other han d to pull the towel back from his eyes but it was holding the hold ­‐all with the olive oil the retsina and the postcards from santorini and he very much didnt want to put it down he experienced one of those self moments one of those moments when yo u suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think who am i what am i up to what have i achieved am i doing well he whimpered very slightly he tried to free his hand but he couldnt the other hand was holding his tightly he had no recourse bu t to edge onwards towards the corner he leaned around it and shook his head in an attempt to dislodge the towel this seemed to provoke a sharp cry of some unfashionable emotion from the owner of the other hand the towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering into those of ford prefect beyond him stood slartibartfast and beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and a large closed door they were both pressed back against the wall eyes wild with terror as they stared out into the t hick blind cloud around them and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building where the zarking photon have you been hissed ford panic stricken er well stuttered arthur not really knowing how to sum it all up that briefly here a nd there what are you doing here ford turned his wild eyes on arthur again they wont let us in without a bottle he hissed chapter the first thing arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the party apart from the noise the suf focating heat the wild profusion of colours that protuded dimly through the atmosphere of heavy smoke the carpets thick with ground glass ash and avocado droppings and the small group of pterodactyl ­‐like creatures in lurex who descended on his cherishe d bottle of retsina squawking a new pleasure a new pleasure was trillian being chatted up by a thunder god didnt i see you at milliways he was saying were you the one with the hammer yes i much prefer it here so much less reputable so much more fraught squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room the outer dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of happy noisy creatures cheerfully yelling things that nobody could hear at each other and occasionally having crises seems fun said trillian what did you say arthur i said how the hell did you get here i was a row of dots flowing randomly through the universe have you met thor he makes thunder hello said arthur i expect that must be very interesting hi said thor it is have you got a drink er no actually then why dont you go and get one see you later arthur said trillian something jogged arthurs mind and he looked around huntedly zaphod isnt here is he he said see you said trillian firmly later thor glared at him with hard coal ­‐black eyes his beard bristled what little light was there was in the place mustered its forces briefly to glint menacingly off the horns of his helmet he took trillians elbow in his extremely large hand and the muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of volkswagens parking he led her away one of the interesting things about being immortal he said is one of the interesting things about space arthur heard slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature who looked like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet and was gazing raptly a t the old mans deep eyes and silver beard is how dull it is dull said the creature and blinked her rather wrinkled and bloodshot eyes yes said slartibartfast staggeringly dull bewilderingly so you see theres so much of it and so little in it would you like me to quote some statistics er well please i would like to they too are quite sensationally dull ill come back and hear them in a moment she said patting him on the arm lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft a nd moved off into the heaving crown i thought shed never go growled the old man come earthman arthur we must find the silver bail it is here somewhere cant we just relax a little arthur said ive had a tough day trillians her e incidentally she didnt say how it probably doesnt matter think of the danger to the universe the universe said arthur is big enough and old enough to look after itself for half an hour all right he added in response to slartibartfa sts increasing agitation ill wander round and see if anybodys seen it good good said slartibartfast good he plunged into the crowd himself and was told to relax by everybody he passed have you seen a bail anywhere said arthur to a li ttle man who seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody its made of silver vitally important for the future safety of the universe and about this long no said the enthusiastically wizened little man but do have a drink and tel l me all about it ford prefect writhed past dancing a wild frenetic and not entirely unobscene dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing sydney opera house on her head he was yelling a futile conversation at her above the din i like that hat he bawled what i said i like the hat im not wearing a hat well i like the head then what i said i like the head interesting bone ­‐structure what ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of other mov ements he was performing i said you dance great he shouted just dont nod so much what its just that every time you nod said ford ow he added as his partner nodded forward to say what and once again pecked him sharply on the f orehead with the sharp end of her swept ­‐forward skull my planet was blown up one morning said arthur who had found himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or at least edited highlights of it thats why im dressed like th is in my dressing gown my planet was blown up with all my clothes in it you see i didnt realize id be coming to a party the little man nodded enthusiastically later i was thrown off a spaceship still in my dressing gown rather than the space suit one would normally expect shortly after that i discovered that my planet had originally been built for a bunch of mice you can imagine how i felt about that i was then shot at for a while and blown up in fact i have been blown up ridiculously oft en shot at insulted regularly disintegrated deprived of tea and recently i crashed into a swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave ah effervesced the little man and did you have a wonderful time arthur started to choke violently on his drink what a wonderful exciting cough said the little man quite startled by it do you mind if i join you and with that he launched into the most extraordinary and spectacular fit of coughing which caught arthur so much by surprise that he st arted to choke violently discovered he was already doing it and got thoroughly confused together they performed a lung ­‐busting duet which went on for fully two minutes before arthur managed to cough and splutter to a halt so invigorating said the l ittle man panting and wiping tears from his eyes what an exciting life you must lead thank you very much he shook arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd arthur shook his head in astonishment a youngish ­‐looking man came up to him an aggressive ­‐looking type with a hook mouth a lantern nose and small beady little cheekbones he was wearing black trousers a black silk shirt open to what was presumably his navel though arthur had learnt never to make assumptions about the anatomie s of the sort of people he tended to meet these days and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold things hanging round his neck he carried something in a black bag and clearly wanted people to notice that he didnt want them to notice it hey er did i hear you say your name just now he said this was one of the many things that arthur had told the enthusiastic little man yes its arthur dent the man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out yeah he said only there was a man in a mountain wanted to see you i met him yeah only he seemed pretty anxious about it you know yes i met him yeah well i think you should know that i do i met him the man paused to chew a little gum then he clapped arthur on the back ok he said all right im just telling you right good night good luck win awards what said arthur who was beginning to flounder seriously at this point whatever do what you do do it well he made a sort of clucking noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely dynamic gesture why said arthur do it badly said the man who cares who gives a shit the blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the mans face and he started to shout why not go mad he said go away get off my back will you guy just zark off ok im going said arthur hurriedly its been real the man gave a sharp wave and disappeared off into the throng what was that about said arthur to a girl he found standing beside him why did he tell me to win awards just showbiz talk shrugged the girl hes just won an award at the annual ursa minor alpha recreational illusions institute awards ceremony and was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly only you didnt mention it so he couldnt oh said arthur oh well im sorry i didnt what was it for the most gratuitous use of the word fuck in a serious screenplay its very prestigious i see said arthur yes and what do you get for that a rory its just a small silver thing set on a large black base what did you say i didnt say anything i was just about to ask what the silver oh i thought you s aid wop said what wop chapter people had been dropping in on the party now for some years fashionable gatecrashers from other worlds and for some time it had occurred to the partygoers as they had looked out at their own world beneath them with its wrecked cities its ravaged avocad o farms and blighted vineyards its vast tracts of new desert its seas full of biscuit crumbs and worse that their world was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it had been some of them had begun to wonder if they could m anage to stay sober for long enough to make the entire party spaceworthy and maybe take it off to some other peoples worlds where the air might be fresher and give them fewer headaches the few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a feeble existence on the half ­‐dead ground of the planets surface would have been extremely pleased to hear this but that day as the party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in haggard fear of yet another cheese ­‐and­‐wine raid it bec ame clear that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for a while that the party would soon be over very soon it would be time to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what time of day it was what time of year it w as and whether in any of this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere the party was locked in a horrible embrace with a strange white spaceship which seemed to be half sticking through it together they were lurching heaving and spinning their way round the sky in grotesque disregard of their own weight the clouds parted the air roared and leapt out of their way the party and the krikkit warship looked in their writhings a little like two ducks one of which is trying to make a thi rd duck inside the second duck whilst the second duck is trying very hard to explain that it doesnt feel ready for a third duck right now is uncertain that it would want any putative third duck to be made by this particular first duck anyway and certai nly not whilst it the second duck was busy flying the sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all and buffeted the ground with shock waves and suddenly with a foop the krikkit ship was gone the party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man leaning against an unexpectedly open door it span and wobbled on its hover jets it tried to right itself and wronged itself instead it staggered back across the sky again for a while these stagg erings continued but clearly they could not continue for long the party was now a mortally wounded party all the fun had gone out of it as the occasional broken ­‐backed pirouette could not disguise the longer at this point that it avoided the ground the heavier was going to be the crash when finally it hit it inside things were not going well either they were going monstrously badly in fact and people were hating it and saying so loudly the krikkit robots had been they had removed the awar d for the most gratuitous use of the word fuck in a serious screenplay and in its place had left a scene of devastation that left arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner ­‐up for a rory we would love to stay and help shouted ford picking his way over the mangled debris only were not going to the party lurched again provoking feverish cries and groans from amongst the smoking wreckage we have to go and save the universe you see said ford and if that sounds like a pretty lame excuse t hen you may be right either way were off he suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying miraculously unbroken on the ground do you mind if we take this he said you wont be needing it he took a packet of potato crisps too trillian shouted arthur in a shocked and weakened voice in the smoking mess he could see nothing earthman we must go said slartibartfast nervously trillian shouted arthur again a moment or two later trillian staggered shaking into view supported b y her new friend the thunder god the girl stays with me said thor theres a great party going on in valhalla well be flying off where were you when all this was going on said arthur upstairs said thor i was weighing her flyings a tricky business you see you have to calculate wind she comes with us said arthur hey said trillian dont i no said arthur you come with us thor looked at him with slowly sm ouldering eyes he was making some point about godliness and it had nothing to do with being clean she comes with me he said quietly come on earthman said slartibartfast nervously picking at arthurs sleeve come on slartibartfast said for d picking at the old mans sleeve slartibartfast had the teleport device the party lurched and swayed sending everyone reeling except for thor and except for arthur who stared shaking into the thunder gods black eyes slowly incredibly arthur put up what appeared to be his tiny little fists want to make something of it he said i beg your minuscule pardon roared thor i said repeated arthur and he could not keep the quavering out of his voice do you want to make something of it he waggled his fists ridiculously thor looked at him with incredulity then a little wisp of smoke curled upwards from his nostril there was a tiny little flame in it too he gripped his belt he expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of sherpas with you he unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt he held it up in his hands to reveal the massive iron head he thus cleared up any possible misunderstanding that he mig ht merely have been carrying a telegraph pole around with him do i want he said with a hiss like a river flowing through a steel mill to make something of it yes said arthur his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong and belligerent he w aggled his fists again this time as if he meant it you want to step outside he snarled at thor all right bellowed thor like an enraged bull or in fact like an enraged thunder god which is a great deal more impressive and did so good sa id arthur thats got rid of him slarty get us out of here chapter all right shouted ford at arthur so im a coward the point is im still alive they were back aboard the starship bistromath so was slartibartfast so was trillian harmony and concord were not well so am i alive arent i retaliated arthur haggard with adventure and anger his eyebrows were leaping up and down as if they wanted to punch each other you damn nearly werent exploded ford arthur turned sharply to slartibartfast who was sitting in his pilot couch on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a bottle which was telling him something he clearly couldnt fathom he appealed to him do you think he understands the first word ive been saying he said quivering with emotion i dont know replied slartibartfa st a little abstractedly im not sure he added glancing up very briefly that i do he stared at his instruments with renewed vigor and bafflement youll have to explain it to us again he said well but later terrible things are afoot he tapped the pseudo ­‐glass of the bottle bottom we fared rather pathetically at the party im afraid he said and our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the key in the lock how in heaven we do that i dont know he muttere d just have to go there i suppose cant say i like the idea at all probably end up dead where is trillian anyway said arthur with a sudden affectation of unconcern what he had been angry about was that ford had berated him for wasting time over all the business with the thunder god when they could have been making a rather more rapid escape arthurs own opinion and he had offered it for whatever anybody might have felt it was worth was that he had been extraordinarily brave and resourceful the prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a pair of fetid dingos kidneys what really hurt though was that trillian didnt seem to react much one way or the other and had wandered off somewhere and where are my potato crisps s aid ford they are both said slartibartfast without looking up in the room of informational illusions i think that your young lady friend is trying to understand some problems of galactic history i think the potato crisps are probably helping her chapter it is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes for instance there was once an insanely aggressive race of people called the silastic armorfiends of striterax that was just the name of their race the na me of their army was something quite horrific luckily they lived even further back in galactic history than anything we have so far encountered ʹ twenty billion years ago ʹ when the galaxy was young and fresh and every idea worth fighting for was a new o ne and fighting was what the silastic armorfiends of striterax were good at and being good at it they did a lot they fought their enemies ie everybody else they fought each other their planet was a complete wreck the surface was littered with a bandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war machines which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the silastic armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other the best way to pick a fight with a silastic armorfiend was just to be bo rn they didnt like it they got resentful and when an armorfiend got resentful someone got hurt an exhausting way of life one might think but they did seem to have an awful lot of energy the best way of dealing with a silastic armorfiend was to pu t him into a room of his own because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up eventually they realized that this was something they were going to have to sort out and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who had to carry a weapon as part of h is normal silastic work policemen security guards primary school teachers etc had to spend at least forty ­‐five minutes every day punching a sack of potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggressions for a while this worked well until someone thought that it would be much more efficient and less time ­‐consuming if they just shot the potatoes instead this led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things and they all got very excited at th e prospect of their first major war for weeks another achievement of the silastic armorfiends of striterax is that they were the first race who ever managed to shock a computer it was a gigantic spaceborne computer called hactar which to this day is r emembered as one of the most powerful ever built it was the first to be built like a natural brain in that every cellular particle of it carried the pattern of the whole within it which enabled it to think more flexibly and imaginatively and also it s eemed to be shocked the silastic armorfiends of striterax were engaged in one of their regular wars with the strenuous garfighters of stug and were not enjoying it as much as usual because it involved an awful lot of trekking through the radiation swam ps of cwulzenda and across the fire mountains of frazfraga neither of which terrains they felt at home in so when the strangulous stilettans of jajazikstak joined in the fray and forced them to fight another front in the gamma caves of carfrax and the ice storms of varlengooten they decided that enough was enough and they ordered hactar to design for them an ultimate weapon what do you mean asked hactar by ultimate to which the silastic armorfiends of striterax said read a bloody dictionar y and plunged back into the fray so hactar designed an ultimate weapon it was a very very small bomb which was simply a junction box in hyperspace that would when activated connect the heart of every major sun with the heart of every other major s un simultaneously and thus turn the entire universe in to one gigantic hyperspatial supernova when the silastic armorfiends tried to use it to blow up a strangulous stilettan munitions dump in one of the gamma caves they were extremely irritated that it didnt work and said so hactar had been shocked by the whole idea he tried to explain that he had been thinking about this ultimate weapon business and had worked out that there was no conceivable consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the known consequence of setting it off and he had therefore ta ken the liberty of introducing a small flaw into the design of the bomb and he hoped that everyone involved would on sober reflection feel that the silastic armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer later they thought better of it and des troyed the faulty bomb as well then pausing only to smash the hell out of the strenuous garfighters of stug and the strangulous stilettans of jajazikstak they went on to find an entirely new way of blowing themselves up which was a profound relief to everyone else in the galaxy particularly the garfighters the stilettans and the potatoes trillian had watched all this as well as the story of krikkit she emerged from the room of informational illusions thoughtfully just in time to discover that they had arrived too late chapter even as the starship bistromath flickered into objective being on the top of a small cliff on the mile ­‐wide asteroid which pursued a lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star system of krikkit i ts crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event they didnt realize they were going to see two they stood cold lonely and helpless on the cliff edge and watched the activity below lances of light wheeled in sinister arcs against the void from a point only about a hundred yards below and in front of them they stared into the blinding event an extension of the ships field enabled them to stand there by once again exploiting the minds predisposition to have tricks played on it the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid or of not being able to breathe simply became someb ody elses the white krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags of the asteroid alternately flaring under arclights or disappearing in shadow the blackness of the shaped shadows cast by the hard rocks danced together in wild choreography a s the arclights swept round them the eleven white robots were bearing in procession the wikkit key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights the wikkit key was rebuilt its components shone and glittered the steel pillar or marvins leg o f strength and power the gold bail or heart of the improbability drive of prosperity the perspex pillar or argabuthon sceptre of justice of science and reason the silver bail or rory award for the most gratuitous use of the word fuck in a serious screenplay and the now reconstituted wooden pillar or ashes of a burnt stump signifying the death of english cricket of nature and spirituality i suppose there is nothing we can do at this point asked arthur nervously no sighed slartibartfast the expression of disappointment which crossed arthurs face was a complete failure and since he was standing obscured by shadow he allowed it to collapse into one of relief pity he said we have no weapons said slartibartfast stupidly damn said arthur very quietly ford said nothing trillian said nothing but in a peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way she was staring at the blankness of the space beyond the asteroid the asteroid circled the dust cloud which surrounded the slo ­‐time envelope which enclosed the world on which lived the people of krikkit the masters of krikkit and their killer robots the helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the krikkit robots were aware of their presence they could only assume that they must be but that they felt quite rightly in the circumstances that they had nothing to fear they had an historic task to perform and their audience could be regarded with contempt terrible impotent feeling isnt it said arthur but the o thers ignored him in the centre of the area of light which the robots were approaching a square ­‐shaped crack appeared in the ground the crack defined itself more and more distinctly and soon it became clear that a block of the ground about six feet s quare was slowly rising at the same time they became aware of some other movement but it was almost sublimal and for a moment or two it was not clear what it was that was moving then it became clear the asteroid was moving it was moving slowly in towards the dust cloud as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler in its depths they were to make in real life the journey through the cloud which they had already made in the room of informational illusions they stood frozen in silence trillian frowned an age seemed to pass events seemed to pass with spinning slowness as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the vague and soft outer perimeter of the cloud and soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity they passed on through it on and on dimly aware of vague shapes and whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of the eye the dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light the shafts of brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of dust trillian again regarded the passage from within her own frowning thoughts and they were through it whether it had taken a minute or half an hour they werent sure but they were through it and confronted with a fresh blankness as if space were pinched out of existence in front of them and now things moved quickly a blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the block which had risen three feet out of the ground and out of that rose a smaller perspex block dazzling with interior dancing colours the block was slotted with deep groves three upri ght and two across clearly designed to accept the wikkit key the robots approached the lock slotted the key into its home and stepped back again the block twisted round of is own accord and space began to alter as space unpinched itself it seemed agonizingly to twist the eyes of the watchers in their sockets they found themselves staring blinded at an unravelled sun which stood now before them where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space it was a second or two before they were even sufficiently aware of what had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified blinded eyes in that second or two they were aware of a tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that sun they st aggered back and heard ringing in their ears the thin and unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison krikkit krikkit krikkit krikkit the sound chilled them it was harsh it was cold it was empty it was mechanically dismal it was als o triumphant they were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost missed the second historic event zaphod beeblebrox the only man in history to survive a direct blast attack from the krikkit robots ran out of the krikkit warship brandish ing a zap gun ok he cried the situation is totally under control as of this moment in time the single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung his battleclub and connected it with the back of zaphods left head who the zark did that said the left head and lolled sickeningly forward his right head gazed keenly into the middle distance who did what it said the club connected with the back of his right head zaphod measured his length as a rather strange shape on the ground within a matter of seconds the whole event was over a few blasts from the robots were sufficient to destroy the lock for ever it split and melted and splayed its contents brokenly the robots marched grimly and it almost seemed in a slightly dis heartened manner back into their warship which with a foop was gone trillian and ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to the dark still body of zaphod beeblebrox chapter i dont know said zaphod for what seemed to him like the thirty ­‐ seventh time they could have killed me but they didnt maybe they just thought i was a kind of wonderful guy or something i could understand that the others silently registered their opinions of this theory zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck his back seemed to wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his heads i think he whispered that there is something wrong with those anodized dudes something fundamentally weird they are programmed to kill everybody slartibartfast pointed out that wheezed zaphod between the whacking thuds could be it he didnt seem altogether convinced hey baby he said to trillian hoping this would make up for his previous behav iour you all right she said gently yeah he said im fine good she said and walked away to think she stared at the huge visiscreen over the flight couches and twisting a switch she flipped local images over it one image was the blankn ess of the dust cloud one was the sun of krikkit one was krikkit itself she flipped between them fiercely well thats goodbye galaxy then said arthur slapping his knees and standing up no said slartibartfast gravely our course is clear he furrowed his brow until you could grow some of the smaller root vegetables in it he stood up he paced around when he spoke again what he said frightened him so much he had to sit down again we must go down to krikkit he said a deep sigh shook his old frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets once again he said we have failed pathetically quite pathetically that said ford quietly is because we dont care enough i told you he swung his feet up on the instrum ent panel and picked fitfully at something on one of his fingernails but unless we determine to take action said the old man querulously as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his nature then we shall all be destroyed we shall all die surely we care about that not enough to want to get killed ov er it said ford he put on a sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who wanted to see it slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive and he fought against it he turned again to zaphod who was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain you surely must have some idea he said of why they spared your life it seems most strange and unusual i kind of think they didnt even know shrugged zaphod i told you they hit me with the most feeble blast just knocked me out right they lugged me into their ship dumped me into a corner and ignored me like they were embarrassed about me being there if i said anything they knocked me out again we had some great conversations hey ugh hi there ugh i wonderugh kept me amused for hours you know he winced again he was toying with something in his fingers he held it up it was the gold bail ʹ the heart of gold the heart of the infinite improbability drive only that and the wooden pil lar had survived the destruction of the lock intact i hear your ship can move a bit he said so how would you like to zip me back to mine before you will you not help us said slartibartfast id love to stay and help you save the galaxy i nsisted zaphod rising himself up on to his shoulders but i have the mother and father of a pair of headaches and i feel a lot of little headaches coming on but next time it needs saving im your guy hey trillian baby she looked round briefly yes you want to come heart of gold excitement and adventure and really wild things im going down to krikkit she said chapter it was the same hill and yet not the same this time it was not an informational illusion this was krikkit itself and they were standing on it near them behind the trees stood the strange italian restaurant which had brought these their real bodies to this the real present world of krikkit the strong grass under their feet was real the rich soil real too the heady fragrances from the tree too were real the night was real night krikkit possibly the most dangerous place in the galaxy for anyone who isnt a krikkiter to stand the pl ace that could not countenance the existence of any other place whose charming delightful intelligent inhabitants would howl with fear savagery and murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own arthur shuddered slartibartfast shuddered ford surprisingly shuddered it was not surprising that he shuddered it was surprising that he was there at all but when they had returned zaphod to his ship ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away wrong he thought to himself wron g wrong wrong he hugged to himself one of the zap guns with which they had armed themselves out of zaphods armoury trillian shuddered and frowned as she looked into the sky this too was not the same it was no longer blank and empty whilst the c ountryside around them had changed little in the two thousand years of the krikkit wars and the mere five years that had elapsed locally since krikkit was sealed in its slo ­‐time envelope ten billion years ago the sky was dramatically different dim ligh ts and heavy shapes hung in it high in the sky where no krikkiter ever looked were the war zones the robot zones ʹ huge warships and tower blocks floating in the nil ­‐o­‐grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface of krikkit trillian stared at them and thought trillian whispered ford prefect to her yes she said what are you doing thinking do you always breathe like that when youre thinking i wasnt aware that i was breathing thats what worried me i think i know said trillian shhhh said slartibartfast in alarm and his thin trembling hand motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree suddenly as before in the tape there were lights coming along the hill path but this time the dancing beams were not from lanterns but electric torches ʹ not in itself a dramatic change but every detail made their hearts thump with fear this time there were no lilting whimsical songs about flowers and farming and dead dogs but hushed voices in urgent debate a light moved in the sky with slow weight arthur was clenched with a claustrophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his throat within seconds a second party became visible approaching from the other side of the dark hill they wer e moving swiftly and purposefully their torches swinging and probing around them the parties were clearly converging and not merely with each other they were converging deliberately on the spot where arthur and the others were standing arthur heard the slight rustle as ford prefect raised his zap gun to his shoulder and the slight whimpering cough as slartibartfast raised his he felt the cold unfamiliar weight of his own gun and with shaking hands he raised it his fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the extreme danger catch as ford had shown him he was shaking so much that if hed fired at anybody at that moment he probably would have burnt his signature on them only trillian didnt raise her gun she raised her eyebrows lo wered them again and bit her lip in thought has it occurred to you she began but nobody wanted to discuss anything much at the moment a light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they span around to find a third party of krikkiters be hind them searching them out with their torches ford prefects gun crackled viciously but fire spat back at it and it crashed from his hands there was a moment of pure fear a frozen second before anyone fired again and at the end of the second nob ody fired they were surrounded by pale ­‐faced krikkiters and bathed in bobbing torch light the captives stared at their captors the captors stared at their captives hello said one of the captors excuse me but are you aliens chapter meanwhile more millions of miles away than the mind can comfortably encompass zaphod beeblebrox was throwing a mood again he had repaired his ship ʹ that is hed watched with alert interest whilst a service robot had repaired it for him it was now once again one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in existence he could go anywhere do anything he fiddled with a book and then tossed it away it was the one hed read before he walked over to the communications bank and opened an all ­‐ frequencies emergency channel anyone want a drink he said this an emergency feller crackled a voice from halfway across the galaxy got any mixers said zaphod go take a ride on a comet ok ok said zaphod and flipped the channel shut again he sighed and sat down he got up again and wandered over to a computer screen he pushed a few buttons little blobs started to rush around the screen eating each other pow said zaphod freee oooo pop pop pop hi there said the computer brightly after a minute of this you have scored three points previous best score seven million five hundred and ninety ­‐seven thousand two hundred and ok ok said zaphod and flipped the screen blank again he sat down again he played with a pencil this too began slowly to lose its fascination ok ok he said and fed his score and the previous one into the computer his ship made a blur of the universe chapter tell us said the thin pale ­‐faced krikkiter who had stepped forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the circle of torchlight handling his gun as if he was just holding it for someone else whod just popped off somewhere but would be back in a minute do you know anything about something called the balance of nature there was no reply from their captives or at least nothing more articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts the torchlight continued to play over them high in the sky above them dark activity continued in the robot zones its just continued the krikkiter uneasily something we heard about probably nothing important well i suppose wed better kill you then he looked down at his gun as if he was try ing to find which bit to press that is he said looking up again unless theres anything you want to chat about slow numb astonishment crept up the bodies of slartibartfast ford and arthur very soon it would reach their brains which were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones up and down trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a jigsaw by shaking the box were worried you see said another man from the crowd about this plan of universal destruction yes added another and the balance of nature it just seemed to us that if the whole of the rest of the universe is destroyed it will somehow upset the balance of nature were quite keen on ecology you see his voice trailed away unhappily and sport said another loudly this got a cheer of approval from the others yes agreed the first and sport he looked back at his fellows uneasily and scratched fitfully at his cheek he seemed to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion as if ever ything he wanted to say and everything he thought were entirely different things between which he could see no possible connection you see he mumbled some of us and he looked around again as if for confirmation the others made encouraging nois es some of us he continued are quite keen to have sporting links with the rest of the galaxy and though i can see the argument about keeping sport out of politics i think that if we want to have sporting links with the rest of the galaxy which we do then its probably a mistake to destroy it and indeed the rest of the universe his voice trailed away again which is what seems to be the idea now wh said slartibartfast wh hhhh said arthur dr said ford prefect ok said trillian lets talk about it she walked forward and took the poor confused krikkiter by the arm he looked about twenty ­‐ five which meant because of the peculiar manglings of time that had been going on in this area that he would have been just twenty when the krikkit wars were finished ten billion years ago trillian led him for a short walk through the torchlight before she said anything more he stumbled uncertainly after her the encircling torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating to this strange quiet girl who alone in the universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing she turned and faced him and lightly held both his arms he was a picture of bewildered misery tell me she said he sai d nothing for a moment whilst his gaze darted from one of her eyes to the other we he said we have to be alone i think he screwed up his face and then dropped his head forward shaking it like someone trying to shake a coin out of a money bo x he looked up again we have this bomb now you see he said its just a little one i know she said he goggled at her as if shed said something very strange about beetroots honestly he said its very very little i know she said again but they say his voice trailed on they say it can destroy everything that exists and we have to do that you see i think will that make us alone i dont know it seems to be our function though he said and dropped his head again wh atever that means said a hollow voice from the crowd trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder its all right she said quietly but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd to hear you dont have to do it she rocked him you dont have to do it she said again she let him go and stood back i want you to do something for me she said and unexpectedly laughed i want she said and laughed again she put her hand over her mouth and then said with a straight face i want you to take me to your leader and she pointed into the war zones in the sky she seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there her laughter seemed to discharge something in the a tmosphere from somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to sing a tune which would have enabled paul mccartney had he written it to buy the world chapter zaphod beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel like the hell of a guy he was he was very confused but continued crawling doggedly anyway because he was that brave he was confused by something he had just seen but not half as confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was he was in the robot war zones many miles above the surface of the pla net krikkit the atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from any rays or anything which space might care to hurl in his direction he had parked the starship heart of gold amongst the huge jostling dim hulks that crowded the sky here above k rikkit and had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky buildings armed with nothing but a zap gun and something for his headaches he had found himself in a long wide and badly lit corridor in which he was able to hide unt il he worked out what he was going to do next he hid because every now and then one of the krikkit robots would walk along it and although he had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands it had nevertheless been an extremely painful one and he had no desire to stretch what he was only half ­‐inclined to call his good fortune he had ducked at one point into a room leading off the corridor and had discovered it to be a huge and again dimly lit chamber in fact it was a museum with just o ne exhibit ʹ the wreckage of a spacecraft it was terribly burnt and mangled and now that he had caught up with some of the galactic history he had missed through his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him at school he was able to put in an intelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through the dust cloud all those billions of years ago and started the whole business off but and this is where he had become confused there was something no t at all right about it it was genuinely wrecked it was genuinely burnt but a fairly brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a genuine spacecraft it was as if it was a full ­‐scale model of one ʹ a solid blueprint in other words it was a very useful thing to have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself and didnt know how to do it it was not however anything that would ever fly anywhere itself he was still puzzling over this ʹ in fact hed only just star ted to puzzle over it ʹ when he became aware that a door had slid open in another part of the chamber and another couple of krikkit robots had entered looking a little glum zaphod did not want to tangle with them and deciding that just as discretion w as the better part of valour so was cowardice the better part of discretion he valiantly hid himself in a cupboard the cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of a shaft which led down through an inspection hatch into a wide ventilation tunnel he led himself down into it and started to crawl along it which is where we found him he didnt like it it was cold dark and profoundly uncomfortable and it frightened him at the first opportunity ʹ which was another shaft a hundred yards further alo ng ʹ he climbed back up out of it this time he emerged into a smaller chamber which appeared to be a computer intelligence centre he emerged in a dark narrow space between a large computer bank and the wall he quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber and started to leave again when he began to listen with interest to what the other occupants were saying its the robots sir said one voice theres something wrong with them what exactly these were the voices of two war comman d krikkiters all the war commanders lived up in the sky in the robot war zones and were largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet well sir i think its just as well that they are being phased out of the war effort and that we are now going to detonate the supernova bomb in the very short time since we were released from the envelope ʹ get to the point the robots arent enjoying it sir what the war sir it seems to be getting them down theres a certain world ­‐weariness about them or perhaps i should say universe ­‐ weariness well thats all right theyre meant to be helping to destroy it yes well theyre finding it difficult sir they are afflicted with a certain lassitude theyre just finding it hard to get behind the job they lack oomph what are you trying to say well i think theyre very depressed about something sir what on krikkit are you talking about well in the few skirmishes theyve had recently it seems that they go into battle raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think why bother what cosmically speaking is it all about and they just seem to get a little tired and a little grim and then what do they do er quadratic equations mostly sir fiendishly difficult ones by all accounts and then they sulk sulk yes sir whoever heard of a robot sulking i dont know sir what was that noise it was the noise of zaphod leaving with his head spinning chapter in a deep well of darkness a crippled robot sat it had been silent in its metallic darkness for some time it was cold and damp but being a robot it was supposed not to be able to notice these things with an enormous effort of will however it did manage to notice them its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the krikkit war computer it wasnt enjoying the experience and neither was the central intelli gence core of the krikkit war computer the krikkit robots which had salvaged this pathetic metal creature from the swamps of squornshellous zeta had recognized almost immediately its gigantic intelligence and the use which this could be to them they h adnt reckoned with the attendant personality disorders which the coldness the darkness the dampness the crampedness and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease it was not happy with its task apart from anything else the mere coordination of an entire planets military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its formidable mind and the rest of it had become extremely bored having solved all the major mathematical physical chemical biological sociological philosophical etymological meteorological and psychological problems of the universe except his own three times over he was severely stuck for something to do and had taken up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone or indeed tune the latest one was a lullaby marvin dron ed now the world has gone to bed darkness wont engulf my head i can see by infra ­‐red how i hate the night he paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle the next verse now i lay me down to sleep try to count electric sheep sweet dream wishes you can keep how i hate the night marvin hissed a voice his head snapped up almost dislodging the intricate network of electrodes which connected him to the central krikkit war computer an inspe ction hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly heads was peering through whilst the other kept on jogging it by continually darting to look this way and that extremely nervously oh its you muttered the robot i might have known hey kid s aid zaphod in astonishment was that you singing just then i am marvin acknowledged bitterly in particularly scintillating form at the moment zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around are you alone he said yes sa id marvin wearily i sit here pain and misery my only companions and vast intelligence of course and infinite sorrow and yeah said zaphod hey whats your connection with all this this said marvin indicating with his less damaged arm all the electrodes which connected him with the krikkit computer then said zaphod awkwardly i guess you must have saved my life twice three times said marvin zaphods head snapped round his other one was looking hawkishly in entirely the w rong direction just in time to see the lethal killer robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke it staggered backwards and slumped against a wall it slid down it it slipped sideways threw its head back and started to sob inconsolably zaph od looked back at marvin you must have a terrific outlook on life he said just dont even ask said marvin i wont said zaphod and didnt hey look he added youre doing a terrific job which means i suppose said marvin requiring only one ten thousand million billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to make this particular logical leap that youre not going to release me or anything like that kid you know id love to but youre not going to no i see youre working well yes said marvin why stop now just when im hating it i got to find trillian and the guys hey you any idea where they are i mean i just got a planet to choose from could take a while they are very close said marvin dolefully you can monitor them from here if you like i better go get them asserted zaphod er maybe they need some help right maybe said marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious voice it would be better if you monitored them from here that young girl he added unexpectedly is one of the least benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting zaphod took a moment or two to find h is way through this labyrinthine string of negatives and emerged at the other end with surprise trillian he said shes just a kid cute yeah but temperamental you know how it is with women or perhaps you dont i assume you dont if you do i do nt want to hear about it plug us in totally manipulated what said zaphod it was trillian speaking he turned round the wall against which the krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up to reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the krikkit robot war zones it seemed to be a council chamber of some kind ʹ zaphod couldnt make it out too clearly because of the robot slumped against the screen he tried to move the robot but it was heavy with its grief and tried to bite him s o he just looked around as best he could just think about it said trillians voice your history is just a series of freakishly improbable events and i know an improbable event when i see one your complete isolation from the galaxy was freakish for a start right out on the very edge with a dust cloud around you its a set ­‐up obviously zaphod was mad with frustration because he couldnt see the screen the robots head was obscuring his view of the people trillian as talking to his multi ­‐funct ional battleclub was obscuring the background and the elbow of the arm it had pressed tragically against its brow was obscuring trillian herself then said trillian this spaceship that crash ­‐landed on your planet thats really likely isnt it hav e you any idea of what the odds are against a drifting spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit of a planet hey said zaphod she doesnt know what the zark shes talking about ive seen that spaceship its a fake no deal i thought i t might be said marvin from his prison behind zaphod oh yeah said zaphod its easy for you to say that i just told you anyway i dont see what its got to do with anything and especially continued trillian the odds against it intersecti ng with the orbit of the one planet in the galaxy or the whole of the universe as far as i know that would be totally traumatized to see it you dont know what the odds are nor do i theyre that big again its a set ­‐up i wouldnt be surprised if th at spaceship was just a fake zaphod managed to move the robots battleclub behind it on the screen were the figures of ford arthur and slartibartfast who appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing hey look said zaphod excitedly the guys are doing great ra ra ra go get em guys and what about said trillian all this technology you suddenly managed to build for yourselves almost overnight most people would take thousands of years to do all that someone was feeding you what you needed to know someone was keeping you at it i know i know she added in response to an unseen interruption i know you didnt realize it was going on this is exactly my point you never realized anything at all like this supernova bomb how do you know about that said an unseen voice i just know said trillian you expect me to believe that you are bright enough to invent something that brilliant and be too dumb to realize it would take you with it as well thats not just stupid th at is spectacularly obtuse hey whats this bomb thing said zaphod in alarm to marvin the supernova bomb said marvin its a very very small bomb yeah that would destroy the universe in toto added marvin good idea if you ask me they wont get it to work though why not if its so brilliant its brilliant said marvin theyre not they got as far as designing it before they were locked in the envelope theyve spent the last five years building it they think theyve got it right but they havent theyre as stupid as any other organic life form i hate them trillian was continuing zaphod tried to pull the krikkit robot away by its leg but it kicked and growled at him and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing then suddenly it slumped over and continued to express its feelings out of everybodys way on the floor trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber tire d out but with fiercely burning eyes ranged in front of her were the pale ­‐faced and wrinkled elder masters of krikkit motionless behind their widely curved control desk staring at her with helpless fear and hatred in front of them equidistant betwee n their control desk and the middle of the chamber where trillian stood as if on trial was a slim white pillar about four feet tall on top of it stood a small white globe about three maybe four inches in diameter beside it stood a krikkit robot wit h its multi ­‐functional battleclub in fact explained trillian you are so dumb stupid she was sweating zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be doing at this point you are all so dumb stupid that i doubt i very much doubt t hat youve been able to build the bomb properly without any help from hactar for the last five years whos this guy hactar said zaphod squaring his shoulders if marvin replied zaphod didnt hear him all his attention was concentrated on the scre en one of the elders of krikkit made a small motion with his hand towards the krikkit robot the robot raised his club theres nothing i can do said marvin its on an independent circuit from the others wait said trillian the elder made a small motion the robot halted trillian suddenly seemed very doubtful of her own judgment how do you know all this said zaphod to marvin at this point computer records said marvin i have access youre very different aren t you said trillian to the elder masters from your fellow worldlings down on the ground youve spent all your lives up here unprotected by the atmosphere youve been very vulnerable the rest of your race is very frightened you know they dont wan t you to do this youre out of touch why dont you check up the krikkit elder grew impatient he made a gesture to the robot which was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it the robot swung its battleclub it hit the small whit e globe the small white globe was the supernova bomb it was a very very small bomb which was designed to bring the entire universe to an end the supernova bomb flew through the air it hit the back wall of the council chamber and dented it very bad ly so how does she know all this said zaphod marvin kept a sullen silence probably just bluffing said zaphod poor kid i should never have left her alone chapter hactar called trillian what are you up to there was no reply from the enclosing darkness trillian waited nervously she was sure that she couldnt be wrong she peered into the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of response but there was only cold silence hactar she called a gain i would like you to meet my friend arthur dent i wanted to go off with a thunder god but he wouldnt let me and i appreciate that he made me realize where my affections really lay unfortunately zaphod is too frightened by all this so i brought arthur instead im not sure why im telling you all this hello she said again hactar and then it came it was thin and feeble like a voice carried on the wind from a great distance half heard a memory of a dream of a voice wont you both come out said the voice i promise that you will be perfectly safe they glanced at each other and then stepped out improbably along the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway of the heart of gold into the dim granular darkness of t he dust cloud arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her but she wouldnt let him he held on to his airline hold ­‐all with its tin of greek olive oil its towel its crumpled postcards of santorini and its other odds and ends he steadied and reassured that instead they were standing on and in nothing murky dusty nothing each grain of dust of the pulverized computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly catching the sunlight in the darkness each particle of the computer each speck of dust held within itself faintly and weakly the pattern of the whole in reducing the computer to dust the silastic armorfiends of striterax had merely crippled the computer not killed it a weak and insubstantial field held the particles in slight relationships with each other arthur and trillian stood or rather floated in the middle of this bizarre entity they had nothing to breathe but for the moment this seemed not to matter hactar kept his promise they were safe for the moment i have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality said hactar faintly but tricks of the light it is possible to be comfortable with tricks of the light though if that is all you have his voice evanesced and in the dark dust a long velvet pai sley­‐ covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric earth he wanted to shout and shake with rage that the universe kept doing these insanely bewil dering things to him he let this feeling subside and then sat on the sofa ʹ carefully trillian sat on it too it was real at least if it wasnt real it did support them and as that is what sofas are supposed to do this by any test that mattered was a real sofa the voice on the solar wind breathed to them again i hope you are comfortable it said they nodded and i would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your deductions arthur quickly pointed out that he hadnt deduced anything much himself trillian was the one she had simply asked him along because he was interested in life the universe and everything that is something in which i too am interested breathed hacta r well said arthur we should have a chat about it sometime over a cup of tea there slowly materialized in front of them a small wooden table on which sat a silver teapot a bone china milk jug a bone china sugar bowl and two bone china cups an d saucers arthur reached forward but they were just a trick of the light he leaned back on the sofa which was an illusion his body was prepared to accept as comfortable why said trillian do you feel you have to destroy the universe she found it a little difficult talking into nothingness with nothing on which to focus hactar obviously noticed this he chuckled a ghostly chuckle if its going to be that sort of session he said we may as well have the right sort of setting and now t here materialized in front of them something new it was the dim hazy image of a couch ʹ a psychiatrists couch the leather with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous but again it was only a trick of the light around them to complete the s etting was the hazy suggestion of wood ­‐panelled walls and then on the couch appeared the image of hactar himself and it was an eye ­‐twisting image the couch looked normal size for a psychiatrists couch ʹ about five or six feet long the computer lo oked normal size for a black space ­‐borne computer satellite ʹ about a thousand miles across the illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the thing which made the eyes twist all right said trillian firmly she stood up off the sofa she felt that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too many illusions very good she said can you construct real things too i mean solid objects again there was a pause before the answer as if the pulverized mind of hactar h ad to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over which it was scattered ah he sighed you are thinking of the spaceship thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them like waves through the ether yes he acknowledge i can but it takes enormous effort and time all i can do in my particle state you see is encourage and suggest encourage and suggest and suggest the image of hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver as if finding it hard to maintai n itself it gathered new strength i can encourage and suggest it said tiny pieces of space debris ʹ the odd minute meteor a few molecules here a few hydrogen atoms there ʹ to move together i encourage them together i can tease them into shape but it takes many aeons so did you make asked trillian again the model of the wrecked spacecraft er yes murmured hactar i have made a few things i can move them about i made the spacecraft it seemed best to do something then m ade arthur pick up his hold ­‐all from where he had left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly the mist of hactars ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy dreams were moving through it i repented you see he murmured dolefully i repent ed of sabotaging my own design for the silastic armorfiends it was not my place to make such decisions i was created to fulfill a function and i failed in it i negated my own existence hactar sighed and they waited in silence for him to continue his story you were right he said at length i deliberately nurtured the planet of krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the silastic armorfiends and require of me th e design of the bomb i failed to make the first time i wrapped myself around the planet and coddled it under the influence of events i was able to generate they learned to hate like maniacs i had to make them live in the sky on the ground my influence s were too weak without me of course when they were locked away from me in the envelope of slo ­‐time their responses became very confused and they were unable to manage ah well ah well he added i was only trying to fulfill my function and v ery gradually very very slowly the images in the cloud began to fade gently to melt away and then suddenly they stopped fading there was also the matter of revenge of course said hactar with a sharpness which was new in his voice remember he said that i was pulverized and then left in a crippled and semi ­‐impotent state for billions of years i honestly would rather wipe out the universe you would feel the same way believe me he paused again as eddies swept through the dust but primarily he said in his former wistful tone i was trying to fulfill my function ah well trillian said does it worry you that you have failed have i failed whispered hactar the image of the computer on the psychiatrists couch began slowly to fade again ah well ah well the fading voice intoned again no failure doesnt bother me now you know what we have to do said trillian her voice cold and businesslike yes said hactar youre going to disperse me you are going to destroy my consciousness please be my guest ʹ after all these aeons oblivion is all i crave if i havent already fulfilled my function then its too late now thank you and good night the sofa vanished the tea table vanished the couch and th e computer vanished the walls were gone arthur and trillian made their curious way back into the heart of gold well that said arthur would appear to be that the flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided a few last licks and they were gone leaving him with just a pile of ashes where a few minutes previously there had been the wooden pillar of nature and spirituality he scooped them off the hob of the heart of golds gamma barbecue put them in a paper bag and walked back into the bridge i think we should take them back he said i feel that very strongly he had already had an argument with slartibartfast on this matter and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left he had returned to his own ship the bistromath had a furious row with the waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what space was the argument had arisen because arthurs idea of returning the ashes to lords cricket ground at the same moment that they were originally taken wou ld involve travelling back in time a day or so and this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking about that the campaign for real time was trying to put a stop to yes arthur had said but you try and explain that to the mcc and he would hear no more against the idea i think he said again and stopped the reason he started to say it again was because no one had listened to him the first time and the reason he stopped was because it looked fairly clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either ford zaphod and trillian were watching the visiscreens intently as hactar was dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the heart of gold was pumping into it what did it say asked ford i thought i heard it say said trillian in a puzzle voice whats done is done i have fulfilled my function i think we should take these back said arthur holding up the bag containing the ashes i feel that very strongly chapter the sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the theft of the ashes by the krikkit robots through the smoke people were running panicstricken colliding with each other tripp ing over stretchers being arrested one policeman was attempting to arrest wowbagger the infinitely prolonged for insulting behaviour but was unable to prevent the tall grey­‐green alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away thus causing even more panic and pandemonium in the middle of this for the second time that afternoon the figures of arthur dent and ford prefect suddenly materialized they had teleported down out of the heart of gold which was now in parking orbit round the plan et i can explain shouted arthur i have the ashes theyre in this bag i dont think you have their attention said ford i have also helped save the universe called arthur to anyone who was prepared to listen in other words no one that should have been a crowd ­‐stopper said arthur to ford it wasnt said ford arthur accosted a policeman who was running past excuse me he said the ashes ive got them they were stolen by those white robots a moment ago ive got them in this bag they were part of the key to the slo ­‐time envelope you see and well anyway you can guess the rest the point is ive got them and what should i do with them the policeman told him but arthur could only assume that he was speaking metaphorical ly he wandered about disconsolately is no one interested he shouted out a man rushed past him and jogged his elbow he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all over the ground arthur stared down at it with a tight ­‐set mouth ford looked at him wanna go now he said arthur heaved a heavy sigh he looked around at the planet earth for what he was now certain would be the last time ok he said at that moment through the clearing smoke he caught sight of one of the wickets still standing in spite of everything hold on a moment he said to ford when i was a boy can you tell me later i had a passion for cricket you know but i w asnt very good at it or not at all if you prefer and i always dreamed rather stupidly that one day i would bowl at lords he looked around him at the panicstricken throng no one was going to mind very much ok said ford wearily get it over with i shall be over there he added being bored he went and sat down on a patch of smoking grass arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon the cricket ball had actually landed in his bag and he looked through the bag he had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it wasnt the same bag that hed had at the time still there the ball was amongst his souvenirs of greece he took it out and polished it against his hip spat on it and polished it again he put the bag down he was going to do this properly he tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand feeling its weight with a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern he trotted off away from the wicket a medium ­‐fast pace he decided and measured a good long run ­‐up he looked up into the sky the birds were wheeling about it a few white clouds scudded across it the air was disturbed with the sounds of police and ambulance sirens and people screaming and yelling but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all he was going to bowl a ball at lords he turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his bedroom slippers he squared his shoulders tossed the ball in the air and caught it again he started to run as he ran he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman oh good he thought that should add a little then as his running feet took him nearer he saw more clearly the batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the england cricket team he was n ot one of the australian cricket team it was one of the robot krikkit team it was a cold hard lethal white killer ­‐ robot that presumably had not returned to its ship with the others quite a few thoughts collided in arthur dents mind at tis moment but he didnt seem to be able to stop running time seemed to be going terribly terribly slowly but still he didnt seem to be able to stop running moving as if through syrup he slowly turned his troubled head and looked at his own hand the hand which was holding the small hard red ball his feet were pounding slowly onwards unstoppably as he stared at the ball gripped in his helpless hand it was emitting a deep red glow and flashing intermittently and still his feet were pounding inexorably forwar d he looked at the krikkit robot again standing implacably still and purposefully in front of him battleclub raised in readiness its eyes were burning with a deep cold fascinating light and arthur could not move his own eyes from them he seemed to be looking down a tunnel at them ʹ nothing on either side seemed to exist some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time were these he felt a hell of a fool he felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a number of t hings he had heard said phrases which now pounded round in his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point where he would inevitably release the ball to the krikkit robot who would inevitably strike it he remembered hactar saying have i failed fai lure doesnt bother me he remembered the account of hactars dying words whats done is done i have fulfilled my function he remembered hactar saying that he had managed to make a few things he remembered the sudden movement in his hold ­‐all that had made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the dust cloud he remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days to come to lords again he also remembered that he wasnt a v ery good bowler he felt his arm coming round gripping tightly on to the ball which he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb that hactar had built himself and planted on him the bomb which would cause the universe to come to an abrupt and prematur e end he hoped and prayed that there wasnt an afterlife then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasnt an afterlife he would feel very very embarrassed meeting everybody he hoped he hoped he hoped tha t his bowling was as bad as he remembered it to be because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this moment and universal oblivion he felt his legs pounding he felt his arm coming round he felt his feet connecting with the airline hol d­‐all hed stupidly left lying on the ground in front of him he felt himself falling heavily forward but having his mind so terribly full of other things at this moment he completely forgot about hitting the ground and didnt still holding the ball fi rmly in his right hand he soared up into the air whimpering with surprise he wheeled and whirled through the air spinning out of control he twisted down towards the ground flinging himself hectically through the air at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into the distance he hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind it still had its multi ­‐functional battleclub raised b ut had suddenly been deprived of anything to hit with a sudden mad access of strength he wrestled the battleclub from the grip of the startled robot executed a dazzling banking turn in the air hurtled back down in a furious power ­‐drive and with one crazy swing knocked the robots head from the robots shoulders are you coming now said ford chapter and at the end they travelled again there was a time when arthur dent would not he said that the bistromathic drive had revealed to him th at time and distance were one that mind and universe were one that perception and reality were one and that the more one travelled the more one stayed in one place and that what with one thing and another he would rather just stay put for a while and s ort it all out in his mind which was now at one with the universe so it shouldnt take too long and he could get a good rest afterwards put in a little flying practice and learn to cook which he had always meant to do the can of greek olive oil was now his most prized possession and he said that the way it had unexpectedly turned up in his life had again given him a certain sense of the oneness of things which made him feel that he yawned and fell asleep in the morning as they prepared to take hi m to some quiet and idyllic planet where they wouldnt mind him talking like that they suddenly picked up a computer ­‐driven distress call and diverted to investigate a small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the merida class seemed to be dancing a s trange little jig through the void a brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine its computer was fine but that its pilot was mad half ­‐mad half ­‐mad the man insisted as they carried him raving aboard he was a journalist with the sideria l daily mentioner they sedated him and sent marvin in to keep him company until he promised to try and talk sense i was covering a trial he said at last on argabuthon he pushed himself up on to his thin wasted shoulders his eyes stared wildly his white hair seemed to be waving at someone it knew in the next room easy easy said ford trillian put a soothing hand on his shoulder the man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the ships sick bay the case he said is now immaterial but there was a witness a witness a man called called prak a strange and difficult man they were eventually forced to administer a drug to make him tell the truth a truth drug his eyes rolled helplessly in his head they gave him too much he said in a tiny whimper they gave him much too much he started to cry i thing the robots must have jogged the surgeons arm robots said zaphod sharply what robots some white robots whispered the man hoarsely broke into the courtroom and stole the judges sceptre the argabuthon sceptre of justice nasty perspex thing i dont know why they wanted it he began to cry again and i think they jog ged the surgeons arm he shook his head loosely from side to side helplessly sadly his eyes screwed up in pain and when the trial continued he said in a weeping whisper they asked prak a most unfortunate thing they asked him he paused and shivered to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth only dont you see he suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted at them theyd given him much too much of the drug he collapsed again moaning quietly much too much too much too much too the group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other there were goose pimples on backs what happened said zaphod at last oh he told it all right said the man savagely for all i know hes still telling it now strange terrible things terrible terrible he screamed they tried to calm him but he struggled to his elbows again terrible things incomprehensible things he shouted things that would drive a man mad he stared wildly at them or in my case he said half ­‐mad im a journalist you mean said arthur quietly that you are used to confronting the truth no said the man with a puzzled frown i mean that i made an excuse and left early he collapsed into a coma from which he recovered only once and briefly on that one occasion they discovered from him the following when it became clear that prak could not be stopped that here was truth in its absolute and final form the court was c leared not only cleared it was sealed up with prak still in it steel walls were erected around it and just to be on the safe side barbed wire electric fences crocodile swamps and three major armies were installed so that no one would ever have t o hear prak speak thats a pity said arthur id like to hear what he had to say presumably he would know what the ultimate question to the ultimate answer is its always bothered me that we never found out think of a number said the computer any number arthur told the computer the telephone number of kings cross railway station passenger inquiries on the grounds that it must have some function and this might turn out to be it the computer injected the number into the ships reconstituted improbability drive in relativity matter tells space how to curve and space tells matter how to move the heart of gold told space to get knotted and parked itself neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the argabuthon chamber of law the courtroom was an austere place a large dark chamber clearly designed for justice rather than for instance for pleasure you wouldnt hold a dinner party here ʹ at least not a successful one the decor would get your guests down the ceilings were high vaulted and very dark shadows lurked there with grim determination the panelling for the walls and benches the cladding of the heavy pillars all were carved from the darkest and most severe tr ees in the fearsome forest of arglebard the massive black podium of justice which dominated the centre of the chamber was a monster of gravity if a sunbeam had ever managed to slink this far into the justice complex of argabuthon it would have turned aro und and slunk straight back out again arthur and trillian were the first in whilst ford and zaphod bravely kept a watch on their rear at first it seemed totally dark and deserted their footsteps echoed hollowly round the chamber this seemed curious all the defences were still in position and operative around the outside of the building they had run scan checks therefore they had assumed the truth ­‐ telling must still be going on but there was nothing then as their eyes became accustomed to th e darkness they spotted a dull red glow in a corner and behind the glow a live shadow they swung a torch round on to it prak was lounging on a bench smoking a listless cigarette hi he said with a little half ­‐wave his voice echoed through the chamber he was a little man with scraggy hair he sat with his shoulders hunched forward and his head and knees kept jiggling he took a drag of his cigarette they stared at him whats going on said trillian nothing said the man and jiggled his shoulders arthur shone his torch full on praks face we thought he said that you were meant to be telling the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth oh that said prak yeah i was i finished theres not nearly as much of it as people imagine some of its pretty funny though he suddenly exploded in about three seconds of manical laughter and stopped again he sat there jiggling his head and knees he dragged on his cigarette with a strange half ­‐smile ford and zaphod came forward out of the shadows tell us about it said ford oh i cant remember any of it now said prak i thought of writing some of it down but first i couldnt find a pencil and then i thought why bother there was a long silence during whi ch they thought they could feel the universe age a little prak stared into the torchlight none of it said arthur at last you can remember none of it no except most of the good bits were about frogs i remember that suddenly he was hooting w ith laughter again and stamping his feet on the ground you would not believe some of the things about frogs he gasped come on lets go and find ourselves a frog boy will i ever see them in a new light he leapt to his feet and did a tiny little d ance then he stopped and took a long drag at his cigarette lets find a frog i can laugh at he said simply anyway who are you guys we came to find you said trillian deliberately not keeping the disappointment out of her voice my name is trillian prak jiggled his head ford prefect said ford prefect with a shrug prak jiggled his head and i said zaphod when he judge d that the silence was once again deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be tossed in lightly am zaphod beeblebrox prak jiggled his head whos this guy said prak jiggling his shoulder at arthur who was standing silent for a mome nt lost in disappointed thoughts me said arthur oh my names arthur dent praks eyes popped out of his head no kidding he yelped you are arthur dent the arthur dent he staggered backwards clutching his stomach and convulsed with fresh paroxysms o laughter hey just think of meeting you he gasped boy he shouted you are the most wow you just leave the frogs standing he howled and screamed with laughte r he fell over backwards on to the bench he hollered and yelled in hysterics he cried with laughter he kicked his legs in the air he beat his chest gradually he subsided panting he looked at them he looked at arthur he fell back again howling wit h laughter eventually he fell asleep arthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others carried prak comatose on to the ship before we picked up prak said arthur i was going to leave i still want to and i think i should do so as soo n as possible the others nodded in silence a silence which was only slightly undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical laughter which came drifting from praks cabin at the farthest end of the ship we have questioned him co ntinued arthur or at least you have questioned him ʹ i as you know cant go near him ʹ on everything and he doesnt really seem to have anything to contribute just the occasional snippet and things i dont want to hear about frogs the others tri ed not to smirk now i am the first to appreciate a joke said arthur and then had to wait for the others to stop laughing i am the first he stopped again this time he stopped and listened to the silence there actually was silence this time a nd it had come very suddenly prak was quiet for days they had lived with constant manical laughter ringing round the ship only occasionally relieved by short periods of light giggling and sleep arthurs very soul was clenched with paranoia this was not the silence of sleep a buzzer sounded a glance at a board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by prak hes not well said trillian quietly the constant laughing is completely wrecking his body arthurs lips twitched but he said nothin g wed better go and see him said trillian trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face he wants you to go in she said to arthur who was wearing his glum and tight ­‐lipped one he thrust his hands deep into his dressing ­‐ gown pockets and tried to think of something to say which wouldnt sound petty it seemed terribly unfair but he couldn t please said trillian he shrugged and went in taking his glum and tight ­‐lipped face with him despite the reaction this always provoked from prak he looked down at his tormentor who was lying quietly on the bed ashen and wasted his breathing was very shallow ford and zaphod were standing by the bed looking awkward you wanted to ask me something said prak in a thin voice and coughed slightly just the cough made arthur stiffen but it passed and subsided how do you know that he aske d prak shrugged weakly cos its true he said simply arthur took the point yes he said at last in rather a strained drawl i did have a question or rather what i actually have is an answer i wanted to know what the question was prak nod ded sympathetically and arthur relaxed a little its well its a long story he said but the question i would like to know is the ultimate question of life the universe and everything all we know is that the answer is forty ­‐two which is a lit tle aggravating prak nodded again forty ­‐two he said yes thats right he paused shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like the shadows of clouds crossing the land im afraid he said at last that the question and the answer are mutually exclusive knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other it is impossible that both can ever be known about the same universe he paused again disappointment crept into arthurs face and snuggled down into its accustomed place except said prak struggling to sort a thought out if it happened it seems that the question and the answer would just cancel each other out and take the universe with them which would then be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable it is possible that this has already happened he added with a weak smile but there is a certain amount of uncertainty about it a little giggle brushed through him arthur sat down on a stool oh well he said with resignation i was just hopin g there would be some sort of reason do you know said prak the story of the reason arthur said that he didnt and prak said that he knew that he didnt he told it one night he said a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet which had nev er seen one before the planet was dalforsas the ship was this one it appeared as a brilliant new star moving silently across the heavens primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the cold hillsides looked up from their steaming night ­‐drinks and pointed with trembling fingers swearing that they had seen a sign a sign from their gods which meant that they must now arise at last and go and slay the evil princes of the plains in the high turrets of their palaces the princes of the plains looked up and saw the shining star and received it unmistakably as a sign from their gods that they must now go and set about the accursed tribesmen of the cold hillsides and between them the dwellers in the forest looked up into the sky and saw the sigh of the new star and saw it with fear and apprehension for though they had never seen anything like it before they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed and they bowe d their heads in despair they knew that when the rains came it was a sign when the rains departed it was a sign when the winds rose it was a sign when the winds fell it was a sign when in the land there was born at midnight of a full moon a g oat with three heads that was a sign when in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all or even just a child with a retrousse nose that too would often be taken as a sign so there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a sign of a particularly spectacular order and each new sign signified the same thing ʹ that the princes of the plains and the tribesmen of the cold hillsides were about to beat the hell out of ea ch other again this in itself wouldnt be so bad except that the princes of the plains and the tribesmen of the cold hillsides always elected to beat the hell out of each other in the forest and it was always the dwellers in the forest who came off wor st in these exchanges though as far as they could see it never had anything to do with them and sometimes after some of the worst of these outrages the dwellers in the forest would send a messenger to either the leader of the princes of the plains or the leader of the tribesmen of the cold hillsides and demand to know the reason for this intolerable behaviour and the leader whichever one it was would take the messenger aside and explain the reason to him slowly and carefully and with great attenti on to the considerable detail involved and the terrible thing was it was a very good one it was very clear very rational and tough the messenger would hang his head and feel sad and foolish that he had not realized what a tough and complex place the real world was and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it now do you understand the leader would say the messenger would nod dumbly and you see these battles have to take place another dumb nod and why they have to take place in the forest and why it is in everybodys best interest the forest dwellers included that they should er in the long run er yes and the messenger did understand the reason and he returned to his people in the forest but as he approached them as he walked through the forest and amongst the trees he found that all he could remember of the reason was how terribly clear the argument had seemed what it actually was he couldnt remember at all and this of cou rse was a great comfort when next the tribesmen and the princes came hacking and burning their way through the forest killing every forest dweller in their way prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically i was the messenger he said after the battles precipitated by the appearance of your ship which were particularly savage many of our people died i thought i could bring the reason back i went and was told it by the leader of the princes but on th e way back it slipped and melted away in my mind like snow in the sun that was many years ago and much has happened since then he looked up at arthur and giggled again very gently there is one other thing i can remember from the truth drug apart f rom the frogs and that is gods last message to his creation would you like to hear it for a moment they didnt know whether to take him seriously strue he said for real i mean it his chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath his he ad lolled slightly i wasnt very impressed with it when i first knew what it was he said but now i think back to how impressed i was by the princes reason and how soon afterwards i couldnt recall it at all i think it might be a lot more helpful would you like to know what it is would you they nodded dumbly i bet you would if youre that interested i suggest you go and look for it it is written in thirty ­‐foot­‐high letters of fire on top of the quentulus quazgar mountains in the land of s evorbeupstry on the planet preliumtarn third out from the sun zarss in galactic sector qq active j gamma it is guarded by the lajestic vantrashell of lob there was a long silence following this announcement which was finally broken by arthur sorr y its where he said it is written repeated prak in thirty ­‐foot­‐high letters of fire on top of the quentulus quazgar mountains in the land of sevorbeupstry on the planet preliumtarn third out from the sorry said arthur again which moun tains the quentulus quazgar mountains in the land of sevorbeupstry on the planet which land was that i didnt quite catch it sevorbeupstry on the planet sevorbe ʹ what oh for heavens sake said prak and died testily in the f ollowing days arthur thought a little about this message but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be drawn by it and insisted on following his original plan of finding a nice little world somewhere to settle down and lead a qui et retired life having saved the universe twice in one day he thought that he could take things a little easier from now on they dropped him off on the planet krikkit which was now once again an idyllic pastoral world even if the songs did occasionally get on his nerves he spent a lot of time flying he learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their conversatio n was fantastically boring it was all to do with wind speed wing spans power ­‐to­‐weight ratios and a fair bit about berries unfortunately he discovered once you have learnt birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of it the whole tim e just inane bird chatter there is no getting away from it for that reason arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live on the ground and love it despite a lot of the inane chatter he heard down there as well one day he was walking throug h the fields humming a ravishing tune hed heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in front of him a hatchway opened a ramp extended and a tall grey ­‐green alien marched out and approached him arthur phili it said then glanced sharply at him and down at his clipboard he frowned he looked up at him again ive done you before havent i he said douglas adams so long and thanks for all the fish for jane with thanks to rick and heidi for the loan of their stable event to mogens and andy and all at huntsham court for a number of unstable events and especially to sonny metha for being stable through all events preface far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety ­‐two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape ­‐descended life forms are so amazin gly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea this planet has ʹ or rather had ʹ a problem which was this most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time many solutions were suggested for this problem but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper which is odd because on the whole it wasnt the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy and so the problem remained lots of the people were mean and most of them were miserable even the ones with digital watches many were increasingly of the opinion that theyd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place and some said that even the trees had been a bad move and that no one shou ld ever have left the oceans and then one thursday nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in rickmansworth sudden ly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place this time it was right it would work and no one would have to get nailed to anything sadly however before she co uld get to a phone to tell anyone about it a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred and the idea was lost forever this is her story chapter that evening it was dark early which was normal for the time of year it was cold and windy which was normal it started to rain which was particularly normal a spacecraft landed which was not there was nobody around to see it except some spectacu larly stupid quadrupeds who hadnt the faintest idea what to make of it or whether they were meant to make anything of it or eat it or what so they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other which ne ver worked it slipped down out of the clouds seemingly balanced on a single beam of light from a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds but seen from close to it was strangely beautiful ʹ a grey craft o f elegantly sculpted form quite small of course one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be but if you were to take the findings of the latest mid ­‐galactic census report as any kind of accurate guide to statistical averages you would pr obably guess that the craft would hold about six people and you would be right youd probably guessed that anyway the census report like most such surveys had cost an awful lot of money and didnt tell anybody anything they didnt already know ʹ exce pt that every single person in the galaxy had legs and owned a hyena since this was clearly not true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped the craft slid quietly down through the rain its dim operating lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbow s it hummed very quietly a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb at last it dropped and was quiet a hatchway opened a short flight of steps unfolded itse lf a light appeared in the opening a bright light streaming out into the wet night and shadows moved within a tall figure appeared in the light looked around flinched and hurried down the steps carrying a large shopping bag under its arm it tur ned and gave a single abrupt wave back at the ship already the rain was streaming through its hair thank you he called out thank you very he was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder he glanced up apprehensively and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom it had large characters printed on the side which read to anyone who could decipher the centaurian alphabet duty free mega ­‐ mark et port brasta alpha centauri be like the twenty ­‐ second elephant with heated value in space ­‐bark hold on the figure called waving at the ship the steps which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway stopped re ­‐unfolded and al lowed him back in he emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag he waved again hoisted the bag under his arm and started to run for the shelter of some trees as behind him the spacecraft had already begun its ascent lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment and then hurry onwards revising his path to give the trees a wide berth he moved swiftly across the ground slipping here and there hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with ever ­‐increasing concentration as if being pulled from the sky his feet sloshed through the mud thunder grumbled over the hills he pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on more lights not lightning this time but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded the figure paused again on seeing them and then redoubled his steps making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they had appeared and now the ground was becoming steeper sloping upwards and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle the figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over himself hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine lights streaming through the wall of water the figure pressed back as the machine streaked towards him it was a low bulbous shape like a small whale surfing ʹ sleek grey and rounded and moving at terrifying speed the figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night it was illuminat ed briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split ­‐second to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared to the figures apparent incredulous astonishment the sign r ead my other car is also a porsche chapter rob mckeena was a miserable bastard and he knew it because hed had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with people particularly people he disliked which included at the last count everyone he heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear the hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with danish thermostatic radiator controls it wasnt that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly at least he hoped not it was just the rain which got him down always the rain it was raining now just for a change it was a particular type of rain he particularly disliked particularly when he was driving he had a number for it it was rain type he had read somewhere that the eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous so they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow light snow and heavy snow sludgy snow brittle snow snow that came in flurries snow that came in drifts snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbours boots all over your nice clean igloo floor the snows of winter the snows of spring the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow fine snow feathery snow hill snow valley snow snow that falls in the morning snow that falls at night snow that falls all of a sudd en just when you were going out fishing and snow that despite all your efforts to train them the huskies have pissed on rob mckeena had two hundred and thirty ­‐one different types of rain entered in his little book and he didnt like any of them he shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up it grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the danish thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying since he had left denmark the previous afternoon he had been through types li ght pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery heavy spotting to vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening and two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour post ­‐ downpour squalling cold all the seastorm types between and at once mild and intermediate cold gusting regular and syncopated cab ­‐drumming breezy droplets and now his least favourite of all rain type was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that it didnt make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off he tested this theory by turning them off briefly but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse it just fail ed to get better again when he turned them back on in fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off swish swish swish flop swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop flop scrape he pounded his steering wheel kicked the floor thumped his cassette player till it suddenly started playing barry manilow thumped it again till it stopped and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore it was at the very moment that his fury was p eaking that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights hardly visible through the blatter a figure by the roadside a poor bedraggled figure strangely attired wetter than an otter in a washing machine and hitching poor miserable sod thought rob m ckeena to himself realizing that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself must be chilled to the bone stupid to be out hitching on a filthy night like this all you get is cold wet and lorries driving through puddles at you he shook his head grimly heaved another sigh gave the wheel a turn and hit a large sheet of water square on see what i mean he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it you get some right bastards on the road splattered in hi s rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitch ­‐hiker drenched by the roadside for a moment he felt good about this a moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it and satisfied drove on into the night at least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles and as he drove on the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him for though he did not know it rob mckeena was a rain god all he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays all the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him to cherish him and to water hi m chapter the next two lorries were not driven by rain gods but they did exactly the same thing the figure trudged or rather sloshed onwards till the hill resumed and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind after a while the rain be gan to ease and the moon put in a brief appearance from behind the clouds a renault drove by and its driver made frantic and complex signals to the trudging figure to indicate that he would have been delighted to give the figure a lift only he couldnt this time because he wasnt going in the direction that the figure wanted to go whatever direction that might be and he was sure the figure would understand he concluded the signalling with a cheery thumbs ­‐up sign as if to say that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost terminally wet and he would catch him the next time around the figure trudged on a fiat passed and did exactly the same as the renault a maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at the slowly plodding figure though whether this was meant to convey a hello or a sorry were going the other way or a hey look theres someone in the rain what a jerk was entirely unclear a green strip across the top of the windscreen indicated t hat whatever the message was it came from steve and carola the storm had now definitely abated and what thunder there was now grumbled over more distant hills like a man saying and another thing twenty minutes after admitting hes lost the argume nt the air was clearer now the night cold sound travelled rather well the lost figure shivering desperately presently reached a junction where a side road turned off to the left opposite the turning stood a signpost which the figure suddenly hurri ed to and studied with feverish curiosity only twisting away from it as another car passed suddenly and another the first whisked by with complete disregard the second flashed meaninglessly a ford cortina passed and put on its brakes lurching with surprise the figure bundled his bag to his chest and hurried forward towards the car but at the last moment the cortina span its wheels in the wet and carreered off up the road rather amusingly the figure slowed to a stop and stood there lost and dejected as it chanced the following day the driver of the cortina went into hospital to have his appendix out only due to a rather amusing mix up the surgeon removed his leg in error and before the appendectomy could be rescheduled the app endicitis complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis and justice in its way was served the figure trudged on a saab drew to a halt beside him its window wound down and a friendly voice said have you come far the figure turn ed toward it he stopped and grasped the handle of the door the figure the car and its door handle were all on a planet called the earth a world whose entire entry in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy comprised the two words mostly harmless the man who wrote this entry was called ford prefect and he was at this precise moment on a far from harmless world sitting in a far from harmless bar recklessly causing trouble chapter whether it was because he was drunk ill or suicidally insane would not have been apparent to a casual observer and indeed there were no casual observers in the old pink dog bar on the lower south side of han dold city because it wasnt the sort of place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive any observers in the place would have been mean hawklike observers heavily armed with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy things when they observed things they didnt like one of those nasty hushes had descended on the place a sort of missile crisis sort of hush even the evil ­‐looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers which was a service it provided for free all eyes were on ford prefect some of them were on stalks the particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small defence budget with an american express card which was not acceptable anywhere in the known universe what are you worried about he asked in a cheery kind of voice the expiration date have you guys never heard of neo ­‐relativity out here theres whole new areas of physic s which can take care of this sort of thing time dilation effects temporal relastatics we are not worried about the expiration date said the man to whom he addressed these remarks who was a dangerous barman in a dangerous city his voice was a l ow soft purr like the low soft purr made by the opening of an icbm silo a hand like a side of meat tapped on the bar top lightly denting it well thats good then said ford packing his satchel and preparing to leave the tapping finger reached ou t and rested lightly on the shoulder of ford prefect it prevented him from leaving although the finger was attached to a slablike hand and the hand was attached to a clublike forearm the forearm wasnt attached to anything at all except in the metaph orical sense that it was attached by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its home it had previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner of the bar who on his deathbed had unexpectedly bequeathed it to medical science medica l science had decided they didnt like the look of it and had bequeathed it right back to the old pink dog bar the new barman didnt believe in the supernatural or poltergeists or anything kooky like that he just knew an useful ally when he saw one the hand sat on the bar it took orders it served drinks it dealt murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be murdered ford prefect sat still we are not worried about the expiration date repeated the barman satisfied that he now had f ord prefects full attention we are worried about the entire piece of plastic what said ford he seemed a little taken aback this said the barman holding out the card as if it was a small fish whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the land where fish are eternally blessed we dont accept it ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didnt ha ve any other means of payment on him but decided for the moment to soldier on the disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb but you dont understand said ford his expression slowly ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity this is the american express card it is the finest way of settling bills known to man havent you read their junk mail the cheery quality of fords voice was beginning to grate on the barmans ears it sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo during one of the more sombre passages of a war requiem one of the bones in fords shoulder began to grate against another one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the hand had lea rnt the principles of pain from a highly skilled chiropracter he hoped he could get this business settled before the hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of the bones in different parts of his body luckily the shoulder it w as holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over the barman slid the card back across the bar at ford we have never he said with muted savagery heard of this thing this was hardly surprising ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error towards the end of the fifteen years sojourn he had spent on the planet earth exactly how serious the american express company had got to know very rapidly and the increasingly strident and panic ­‐ stricken demands of its debt collection department were only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass he had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form of currency that no one would accept credit he said aaaargggh these two words were usually coupled together in the old pink dog bar i thought gasped ford that this was meant to be a class establishment he glanced around at the motley collection of thugs pimps and record company exe cutives that skulked on the edges of the dim pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bars inner recesses were pitted they were all very deliberately looking in any direction but his now carefully picking up the threads of their former conversa tions about murders drug rings and music publishing deals they knew what would happen now and didnt want to watch in case it put them off their drinks you gonna die boy the barman murmured quietly at ford prefect and the evidence was on his side the bar used to have one of those signs hanging up which said please dont ask for credit as a punch in the mouth often offends but in the interest of strict accuracy this was altered to please dont ask for credit because having your throat torn ou t by a savage bird while a disembodied hand smashes your head against the bar often offends however this made an unreadable mess of the notice and anyway didnt have the same ring to it so it was taken down again it was felt that the story would get about of its own accord and it had lemme look at the bill again said ford he picked it up and studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman and the equally malevolent gaze of the bird which was currently gouging great furrows in the bar top with its talons it was a rather lengthy piece of paper at the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always takes so long to copy on to the registration form h e had after all been in the bar all day he had been drinking a lot of stuff with bubbles in it and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the pimps thugs and record executives who suddenly couldnt remember who he was he cleared his throat rat her quietly and patted his pockets there was as he knew nothing in them he rested his left hand lightly but firmly on the half ­‐opened flap of his satchel the disembodied hand renewed its pressure on his right shoulder you see said the barman and his face seemed to wobble evilly in front of fords i have a reputation to think of you see that dont you this is it thought ford there was nothing else for it he had obeyed the rules he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill it had bee n rejected he was now in danger of his life well he said quietly if its your reputation with a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped down on the bar top his copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and the official card which said that he was a field researcher for the guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he was n ow doing want a write ­‐up the barmans face stopped in mid ­‐wobble the birds talons stopped in mid ­‐furrow the hand slowly released its grip that said the barman in a barely audible whisper from between dry lips will do nicely sir chapter the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a powerful organ indeed its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had to be drawn up by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse so none of its field researchers are allowed to accept any kind of services discounts or preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favours unless a they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the normal way b their lives would be otherwise in danger c they really want to since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a cut ford always preferred to much about with the first two he stepped out along the street walking briskly the air was stifling but he liked it because it was stifling city air full of excitingly unpleasant smells dangerous music and the sound of warring police tribes he carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without asking it contained everything he owned which at the moment wasnt much a limousine careered down the street dodging between the piles of burning garbage and frightening an old pack animal which lurched screeching out of its way stumbled against the window of a herbal remedies shop set off a wailing alarm blundered off down the street and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small pasta restaurant where it knew it would get photographed and fed ford was walking north he thought he was probably on his way to the space port but he had thought that before he knew he was going through that part of the city where peoples plans often changed quite abruptly do you want to have a good time said a voice from a doorway as far as i can tell said ford im having one thanks are you rich said another this made ford laugh he turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture do i look rich he said dont know said the girl maybe maybe not maybe youll get rich i have a very special service for rich peo ple oh yes said ford intrigued but careful and whats that i tell them its ok to be rich gunfire erupted from a window high above them but it was only a bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row and bass players are two a penny in han dold city ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway you what he said the girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow she was tall and had that kind of self ­‐possessed shyness which is a great tri ck if you can do it its my big number she saéd i have a masters degree in social economics and can be very convincing people love it especially in this city goosnargh said ford prefect which was a special betelgeusian word he used when he knew he should say something but didnt know what it should be he sat on a step took from his satchel a bottle of that ol janx spirit and a towel he opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with the towel which had the opposite effect to the one intended in that the ol janx spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs which had been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of the towel want some he said after hed had a swig himself she shrugged and took the proffered bottle they sat for a while peac efully listening to the clamour of burglar alarms in the next block as it happens im owed a lot of money said ford so if i ever get hold of it can i come and see you then maybe sure ill be here said the girl so how much is a lot fifteen years back pay for writing two words zarquon said the girl which one took the time the first one once id got that the second one just came one afternoon after lunch a huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high a bove them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them it soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to lay an ambush for the other cars with screaming s irens converged on the area only to find themselves being picked off by copters which came thudding through the air between the citys mountainous tower blocks in fact said ford having to shout now above the din it wasnt quite like that i wrote an awful lot but they just cut it down he took his copy of the guide back out of his satchel then the planet got demolished he shouted really worthwhile job eh theyve still got to pay me though you work for that thing the girl yelled back yeah good number you want to see the stuff i wrote he shouted before it gets erased the new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net someone must have found out that the planet i spent fifteen years on has been demolished by now they missed it on the last few revisions but it cant escape their notice for ever its getting impossible to talk isnt it what she shrugged and pointed upwards there was a copter above the m now which seemed to be involved in a side skirmish with the band upstairs smoke was billowing from the building the sound engineer was hanging out of the window by his fingertips and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers with a burning guita r the helicopter was firing at all of them can we move they wandered down the street away from the noise they ran into a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them about the problems of the inner city but then gave up and disapp eared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by the pack animal all the time ford was poking at the interface panel of the guide they ducked into an alleyway ford squatted on a garbage can while information began to flood over the screen o f the guide he located his entry earth mostly harmless almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages here it comes he said please wait said the messages entries are being updated over the sub ­‐etha net this entry is being revised the system will be down for ten seconds at the end of the alley a steel grey limousine crawled past hey look said the girl if you get paid look me up im a working girl and there are people over there who need me i gotta go she brushed aside fords half ­‐articulated protests and left him sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large swathe of his working life b eing swept away electronically into the ether out in the street things had calmed down a little the police battle had moved off to other sectors of the city the few surviving members of the rock band had agreed to recognize their musical differences and pursue solo careers the street theatre group were re ­‐emerging from the pasta restaurant with the pack animal telling it they would take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little respect and a little way further on the steel grey li mousine was parked silently by the kerbside the girl hurried towards it behind her in the darkness of the alley a green flickering glow was bathing ford prefects face and his eyes were slowly widening in astonishment for where he had expected to find nothing an erased closed ­‐off entry there was instead a continuous stream of data ­‐text diagrams figures and images moving descriptions of surf on australian beaches yoghurt on greek islands restaurants to avoid in los angeles currency deals to avoid in istanbul weather to avoid in london bars to go everywhere pages and pages of it it was all there everything he had written with a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went backwards and forwards through it stopping here and there a t

flip ped the switch which he saw was now marked mode execute ready instead of the now old ­‐fashioned access standby which had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone ­‐aged off this was a planet he had seen completely destroyed seen with his own two ey es or rather blinded as he had been by the hellish disruption of air and light felt with his own two feet as the ground had started to pound at him like a hammer bucking roaring gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow vogo n ships and then at last five seconds after the moment he had determined as being the last possible moment had already passed the gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and arthur dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast there was no mistake there couldnt have been the earth had definitely been destroyed definitely definitely boiled away into space and yet here ʹ he activated the guide again ʹ was his own entry on how you would set about having a good ti me in bournemouth dorset england which he had always prided himself on as being one of the most baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered he read it again and shook his head in sheer wonder suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was and it was this that something very weird was happening and if something very weird was happening he thought he wanted it to be happening to him he stashed the guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the street again walking north he a gain passed a steel grey limousine parked by the kerbside and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying its ok honey its really ok you got to learn to feel good about it look at the way the whole economy is structured ford grinned detoured round the next block which was now in flames found a police helicopter which was standing unattended in the street broke into it strapped himself in crossed his fingers and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky he weaved terrifyingly up t hrough the canyoned walls of the city and once clear of them hurtled through the black and red pall of smoke which hung permanently above it ten minutes later with all the copters sirens blaring and its rapid ­‐ fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds ford prefect brought it careering down among the gantries and landing lights at han dold spaceport where it settled like a gigantic star tled and very noisy gnat since he hadnt damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for a first class ticket on the next ship leaving the system and settled into one of its huge voluptuous body ­‐hugging seats this was going to be fun he thought to himself as the ship blinked silently across the insane distances of deep space and the cabin service got into its full extravagant swing yes please he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided up to off er him anything at all he smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again through the mysteriously re ­‐instated entry on the planet earth he had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able to attend to and was terribly ple ased that life had suddenly furnished him with a serious goal to achieve it suddenly occurred to him to wonder where arthur dent was and if he knew arthur dent was one thousand four hundred and thirty ­‐seven light years away in a saab and anxious behind him in the backseat was a girl who had made him crack his head on the door as he climbed in he didnt know if it was just because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid eyes on in years or what it was but he felt stupefied w ith with this is absurd he told himself calm down he told himself you are not he continued to himself in the firmest internal voice he could muster in a fit and rational state you have just hitch ­‐hiked over a hundred thousand light years across the galaxy you are very tired a little confused and extremely vulnerable relax dont panic concentrate on breathing deeply he twisted round in his seat are you sure shes all right he said again beyond the fact that she was to him heartthum pingly beautiful he could make out very little how tall she was how old she was the exact shading of her hair and nor could he ask her anything about herself because sadly she was completely unconscious shes just drugged said her brother shru gging not moving his eyes from the road ahead and thats all right is it said arthur in alarm suits me he said ah said arthur er he added after a moments thought the conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly after an initial flurry of opening hellos he and russell ʹ the wonderful girls brothers name was russell a name which to arthurs mind always suggested burly men with blond moustaches and blow ­‐dried hair who would at the slightest provocation start wearing v elvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would then have to be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches ʹ had quickly discovered they didnt like each other at all russell was a burly man he had a blond moustache his hair was fine and b low dried to be fair to him ʹ though arthur didnt see any necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it ʹ he arthur was looking pretty grim himself a man cant cross a hundred thousand light years mostly in other peoples baggage compartm ents without beginning to fray a little and arthur had frayed a lot shes not a junkie said russell suddenly as if he clearly thought that someone else in the car might be shes under sedation but thats terrible said arthur twisting round to look at her again she seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways on her shoulder her dark hair fell across her face obscuring it whats the matter with her is she ill no said russell merely barking mad what said arthur horrified loopy completely bananas im taking her back to the hospital and telling them to have another go they let her out while she still thought she was a hedgehog a hedgehog russell hooted his horn fiercely at the car that came round the corner towards them half ­‐way on to their side of the road making them swerve the anger seemed to make him feel better well maybe not a hedgehog he said after hed settled down again though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she did if somebody thinks theyre a hedgehog presumably you just give em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves come down again when they feel better at least medical science could deal with it thats the point seem s thats no good enough for fenny though fenny you know what i got her for christmas well no blacks medical dictionary nice present i thought so thousands of diseases in it all in alphabetical order you say her name is fenny yeah take your pick i said anything in here can be dealt with the proper drugs can be prescribed but no she has to have something different just to make life difficult she was like that at school you know was she she was fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had ever heard of i can see how that would be irritating said arthur doubtfully he was rather disappointed to discover her name was fenny it was a rather silly dispiriting name such a s an unlovely maiden aunt might vote herself if she couldnt sustain the name fenella properly not that i wasnt sympathetic continued russell but it did get a bit irritating she was limping for months he slowed down this is your turning isn t it ah no said arthur five miles further on if thats all right ok said russell after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasnt and speeded up again it was in fact arthurs turning but he couldnt leave without finding out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a grip on his mind without even waking up he could take either of the next two turnings they led back to the village that had been his home though what he would find there he hesitated to imagine familiar landmarks had been flitting by ghostlike in the dark giving rise to the shudders that only very normal things can create when seen where the mind is unprepared fo r them and in an unfamiliar light by his own personal time scale so far as he could estimate it living as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns it was eight years since he had left but what time had passed here he could hardly guess indeed what events had passed were beyond his exhausted comprehension because this planet his home should not be here eight years ago at lunchtime this planet had been demolished utterly destroyed by the huge yellow vogon ships which had hung in the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local regulation and breaking it no more than a parking offence delusions said russell what said arthur started out of his train of thought she says she suffers from strange delus ions that shes living in the real world its no good telling her that she is living in the real world because she just says thats why the delusions are so strange dont know about you but i find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting give her th e tablets and piss off for a beer is my answer i mean you can only muck about so much cant you arthur frowned not for the first time well and all this dreams and nightmare stuff and the doctors going on about strange jumps in her brainwave patterns jumps this said fenny arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open but utterly vacant eyes whatever she was looking at wasnt in the car her eyes fluttered her head jerked once and then she was sleeping peacef ully what did she say he asked anxiously she said this this what this what how the heck should i know this hedgehog that chimney pot the other pair of don alfonsos tweezers shes barking mad i thought id mentioned that you dont seem to care very much arthur tried to say it as matter ­‐of­‐factly as possible but it didnt seem to work look buster ok im sorry its none of my business i didnt mean it to sound like that said arthur i know you care a lot obviously he added lying i know that you have to deal with it somehow youll have to excuse me i just hitched from the other side of the horsehead nebula he stared furiously out of the window he was astonished that of all the sensations fightin g for room in his head on this night as he returned to the home that he had thought had vanished into oblivion for ever the one that was compelling him was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing other than that she had said this to him and that he wouldnt wish her brother on a vogon so er what were the jumps these jumps you mentioned he went on to say as quickly as he could look this is my sister i dont even know why im talking to you about ok im sorry perha ps youd better let me out this is at the moment he said it it became impossible because the storm which had passed them by suddenly erupted again lightning belted through the sky and someone seemed to be pouring something which closely resembled the atlantic ocean over them through a sieve russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky blattered at them he worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to pass a lorry marked mckeenas all ­‐weather haulage the tension eased as t he rain subsided it started with all that business of the cia agent they found in the reservoir when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything you remember arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had just hitch ­‐hiked back from the other side of the horsehead nebula and was for this and various other related and astounding reasons a little out of touch with recent events but he decided it would only confuse matters further no he said that was the moment she cr acked up she was in a cafe somewhere rickmansworth dont know what she was doing there but that was where she cracked up apparently she stood up calmly announced that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or something wobbled a bit looked confused and finally collapsed screaming into an egg sandwich arthur winced im very sorry to hear that he said a little stiffly russell made a sort of grumping noise so what said arthur in an attempt to piece things together was the cia agent doing in the reservoir bobbing up and down of course he was dead but what come on you remember all that stuff the hallucinations everyone said it was a cock up the cia trying experiments into drug warfare or something some crackpo t theory that instead of invading a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make everyone think theyd been invaded what hallucinations were those exactly said arthur in a rather quiet voice what do you mean what hallucinations im talking about all that stuff with the big yellow ships everyone going crazy and saying were going to die and then pop they vanished as the effect wore off the cia denied it which meant it must be true arthurs head went a little swimmy his ha nd grabbed at something to steady himself and gripped it tightly his mouth made little opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say something but nothing emerged anyway continued russell whatever drug it was it didnt seem to wea r off so fast with fenny i was all for suing the cia but a lawyer friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum with a banana so he shrugged the vogon squeaked arthur the yellow ships vanished well of course they did they were hallucinations said russell and looked at arthur oddly you trying to say you dont remember any of this where have you been for heavens sake this was to arthur such an astonishingly good question that he half­‐leapt out of his seat with shock christ yelled russell fighting to control the car which was suddenly trying to skid he pulled it out of the path of an oncoming lorry and swerved up on to a grass bank as the car lurched to a halt the girl in t he back was thrown against russells seat and collapsed awkwardly arthur twisted round in horror is she all right he blurted out russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow ­‐dried hair he tugged at his blond moustache he turned to arthur would you please he said let go of the handbrake chapter from here it was a four ­‐mile walk to his village a further m ile to the turning to which the abominable russell had now fiercely declined to take him and from there a further three miles of winding country lane the saab seethed off into the night arthur watched it go as stunned as a man might be who having be lieved himself to be totally blind for five years suddenly discovers that he had merely been wearing too large a hat he shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an otherwis e utterly bewildering universe but since the salient fact if there was one entirely failed to do this he set off up the road again hoping that a good vigorous walk and maybe even some good painful blisters would help to reassure him of his own exist ence at least if not his sanity it was when he arrived a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the horse and groom pub in which there had hung for many years a battered old guiness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat this was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which first his house and then the entire planet earth had been demolished or rather had seemed to be demolished no damn it had been demolished because if it hadnt then where the bloody heck had he been for the last eight years and how he had got there if not in one of the big yellow vogon ships which the appalling russell had just been telling him were merely drug ­‐induced hall ucinations and yet if it had been demolished what was he currently standing on he jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasnt going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times hed been over it he started again this w as the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to sort out later had happened and it still didnt make sense he started again this was the pub in which this was a pub pubs served drinks and he couldnt half do with one satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a conclusion and a conclusion he was happy with even if it wasnt the one he had set out to achieve he strode towards the door and stopped a small black wire ­‐haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall and then catching sight of arthur began to snarl now arthur knew this dog and he knew it well it belonged to an advertising friend of his and was called know ­‐nothing ­‐bozo because the way its hair stood up on its head it reminded people of the president of the united states and the dog knew arthur or at least should do it was a stupid dog could not even read an autocue which way why some people had protested about its name but it should at least have been able to recognize arthur instead of standing there hackles raised as if arthur was the most fearful apparition ever to intrude upon its feeble ­‐witted life this prompted arthur to go and peer at the window again t his time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context he had to admit that the dog had a point he looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds with and ther e was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his present condition would excite comments of a raucous kind and worse still there would doubtless be several people in there at the moment whom he knew all of whom would be bound to bombard him with questi ons which at the moment he felt ill ­‐equipped to deal with will smithers for instance the owner of know ­‐nothing ­‐bozo the non­‐wonder dog an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from one of wills own commercials for being incapable of knowing whic h dog food it was supposed to prefer despite the fact that the meat in all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over it will would definitely be in there here was his dog here was his car a grey porsche s with a sign in the back window which read my other car is also a porsche damn him he stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he hadnt known before will smithers like most of the overpaid and under ­‐scrupulous bastards arthur knew in advertising made a point of ch anging his car every august so that he could tell people his accountant made him do it though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop him what with all the alimony he had to pay and so on ʹ and this was the same car arthur remembe red him having before the number plate proclaimed its year given that it was now winter and that the event which had caused arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred at the beginning of september less than six or seven months could have passed here he stood terribly still for a moment and let know ­‐nothing ­‐bozo jump up and down yapping at him he was suddenly stunned by a realization he could no longer avoid which was this he was now an alien on his own world try as he mig ht no one was even to be able to believe his story not only did it sound perfectly potty but it was flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts was this really the earth was there the slightest possibility that he had made some extraordinary mistake the pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every detail ʹ every brick every piece of peeling paint and inside he could sense its familiar stuffy noisy warmth its exposed beams its unauthentic cast ­‐iron light fittings its bar sticky with beer that people he knew had put their elbows in overlooked by cardboard cutouts of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts it was all the stuff of his home his world he even knew this blasted dog hey know ­‐nothing the sound of will smithers voice meant he had to decide what do to quickly if he stood his ground he would be discovered and the whole circus would begin to hide would only postpone the moment and it was bitterly cold now the fa ct that it was will made the choice easier it wasnt that arthur disliked him as such ­‐will was quite fun it was just that he was fun in such an exhausting way because being in advertising he always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and wher e he had got his jacket from mindful of this arthur hid behind a van hey know ­‐nothing whats up the door opened and will came out wearing a leather flying jacket that hed got a mate of his at the road research laboratory to crash a car into sp ecially in order to get that battered look know ­‐nothing yelped with delight and having got the attention it wanted was happy to forget arthur will was with some friends and they had a game they played with the dog commies they all shouted at th e dog in chorus commies commies commies the dog went berserk with barking prancing up and down yapping its little heart out beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage they all laughed and cheered it on then gradually dispersed to their vari ous cars and disappeared into the night well that clears one thing up thought arthur from behind the van this is quite definitely the planet i remember chapter his house was still there how or why he had no idea he had decided to go and have a look while he was waiting for the pub to empty so that he could go and ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone and there it was he hurriedly let himself in with th e key he kept under a stone frog in the garden because astoundingly the phone was ringing he had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started to run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from the door had to be forced open be cause of the astonishing accumulation of junk mail on the doormat it jammed itself stuck on what he would later discover were fourteen identical personally addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had seventeen identical threatening l etters for non ­‐payment of bills on a credit card he didnt have thirty ­‐three identical letters saying that he personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in todays sophisticat ed jet ­‐setting world and would he therefore like to buy some grotty wallet and also a dead tabby kitten he rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded by all this stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no discriminating connoisse ur would want to miss slithered over a heap of beach villa holidays blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing he collapsed panting on to his cold musty ­‐smelling bed and for a few minutes stopped tryi ng to prevent the world from spinning round his head in the way it obviously wanted to when it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit arthur reached out for the bedside light not expecting it to come on to his surprise it did this appe aled to arthurs sense of logic since the electricity board cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill it seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected when he didnt sending them money obviously only drew attention to yourself the room was much as he had left it ie festeringly untidy though the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust half ­‐read books and magazines nestled amongst piles of half ­‐used towels half pairs of socks reclined in half ­‐drunk cups of coffee what was once a half ­‐ eaten sandwich had now half ­‐turned into something that arthur entirely didnt want to know about bung a fork of lightning through this lot he thought to himself and youd start the evolution of life all over again there was only one thing in the room that was different for a moment or so he couldnt see what the one thing that was different was because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust then his eyes caught it and stopped it was next to a battered old televisio n on which it was only possible to watch open university study courses because if it tried to show anything more exciting it would break down it was a box arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it it was a grey box with a kind of dull lustre to it it was a cubic grey box just over a foot on a side it was tied with a single grey ribbon knotted into a neat bow on the top he got up walked over and touched it in surprise whatever it was clearly gift ­‐wrapped neatly and beautifully and was waiting for him to open it cautiously he picked it up and carried it back to the bed he brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon the top of the box was a lid with a flap tucked into the body of the box he untucked it and looked into the box in it was a glass globe nestling in fine grey tissue paper he drew it out carefully it wasnt a proper globe because it was open at the bottom or as arthur realized turning it over at the top with a thick rim it was a bowl a fish b owl it was made of the most wonderful glass perfectly transparent yet with an extraordinary silver ­‐grey quality as if crystal and slate had gone into its making arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands it was one of the most beautiful objec ts he had ever seen but he was entirely perplexed by it he looked into the box but other than the tissue paper there was nothing on the outside of the box there was nothing he turned the bowl round again it was wonderful it was exquisite but it wa s a fish bowl he tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed possible and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into other worlds as into a deep sea dream entranced arthur turned it round yet again and this time the light from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish bowls surface he held it up adjusting the angle to the light and sud denly saw clearly the finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass so long they said and thanks and that was all he blinked and understood nothing for fully five more minutes he turned the object round and around held it to the light at different angles tapped it for its mesmerizing chime and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could find none finally he stood up filled the bowl wi th water from the tap and put it back on the table next to the television he shook the little babel fish from his ear and dropped it wriggling into the bowl he wouldnt be needing it any more except for watching foreign movies he returned to lie on his bed and turned out the light he lay still and quiet he absorbed the enveloping darkness slowly relaxed his limbs from end to end eased and regulated his breathing gradually cleared his mind of all thought closed his eyes a nd was completely incapable of getting to sleep the night was uneasy with rain the rain clouds themselves had now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on a small transport cafe just outside bournemouth but the sky through which th ey had passed had been disturbed by them and now wore a damply ruffled air as if it didnt know what else it might not do it further provoked the moon was out in a watery way it looked like a ball of paper from the back pocket of jeans that have just c ome out of the washing machine and which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old shopping list or a five pound note the wind flicked about a little like the tail of a horse thats trying to decide what sort of mood its in tonight and a bell somewhere chimed midnight a skylight creaked open it was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the frame was slightly rotten and the hinges had at some time in its life been rather sensibly painted over but eventually it was open a strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof it stood and watched the sky in silence the figure was completely unrecognizable as the wild ­‐looking creature who had burst crazil y into the cottage a little over an hour ago gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown smeared with the mud of a hundred worlds stained with junk food condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports gone was the tangled mane of hair gone the long and kno tted beard flourishing ecosystem and all instead there was arthur dent the smooth and casual in corduroys and a chunky sweater his hair was cropped and washed his chin clean shaven only the eyes still said that whatever it was the universe thought it was doing to him he would still like it please to stop they were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this particular scene and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was not the same brain there had been no surg ery involved just the continual wrenching of experience the night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment the dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted he could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far river th e roll of invisible hills the knot of heavy rainclouds parked somewhere away to the south he could sense too the thrill of being a tree which was something he hadnt expected he knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth but hed never r ealized it could feel quite as good as that he could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him all the way from the new forest he must try this summer he thought and see what having leaves felt like from another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep startled by a flying saucer but it was virtually indistinguishable from the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever encountered for they were creatures who learned very little on their journey through lif e and would be startled to see the sun rising in the morning and astonished by all the green stuff in the fields he was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled by the sun that morning and the morning before and being startled by a clump of trees the day before that he could go further and further back but it got dull because all it consisted of was sheep being startled by things theyd been startled by the day before he left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in developing ripples it felt the presence of other minds hundreds of them thousands in a web some sleepy some sleeping some terribly excited one fractured one fractured he passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again but it eluded him like t he other card with an apple on it in pelmanism he felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be and once you know what it is you want to be true instinct is a very useful device for e nabling you to know that it is he instinctively knew that it was fenny and that he wanted to find her but he could not by straining too much for it he could feel he was losing this strange new faculty so he relaxed the search and let his mind wander more easily once more and again he felt the fracture again he couldnt find it this time whatever his instinct was busy telling him it was all right to believe he wasnt certain that it was fenny ʹ or perhaps it was a different fracture this time it had the same disjointed quality but it seemed a more general feeling of fracture deeper not a single mind maybe not a mind at all it was different he let his mind sink slowly and widely into the earth rippling seeping sinking he was following the earth through its days drifting with the rhythms of its myriad pulses seeping through the webs of its life swelling with its tides turning with its weight always the fracture kept returning a dull disjointed distant ache and no w he was flying through a land of light the light was time the tides of it were days receding the fracture he had sensed the second fracture lay in the distance before him across the land the thickness of a single hair across the dreaming landscape o f the days of earth and suddenly he was upon it he danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer away beneath him a stupefying precipice into nothing him wildly twisting clawing at nothing flailing in horrifying space spinning falling across the jagged chasm had been another land another time an older world not fractured from but hardly joined two earths he woke a cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead the nightmare was spent and so he felt was h e his shoulders dropped he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers at last he was sleepy as well as very tired as to what it meant if it meant anything at all he would think about it in the morning for now he would go to bed and sleep h is own bed his own sleep he could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was it was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather dull blockish shape he looked about him and noticed that he was about eighteen inches above the rose bushes of one of his neighbours john ainsworth his rose bushes were carefully tended pruned back for the winter strapped to canes and labelled and arthur wondered what he was doing above them he wondered what was holding him there and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there he crashed awkwardly to the ground he picked himself up brushed himself down and hobbled back to his house on a sprained ankle he undressed and toppled into bed while he was asleep the phone rang agai n it rang for fully fifteen minutes and caused him to turn over twice it never however stood a chance of waking him up chapter arthur awoke feeling wonderful absolutely fabulous refreshed overjoyed to be home bouncing with energy hardly disa ppointed at all to discover it was the middle of february he almost danced to the fridge found the three least hairy things in it put them on a plate and watched them intently for two minutes since they made no attempt to move within that time he call ed them breakfast and ate them between them they killed a virulent space disease hes picked up without knowing it in the flargathon gas swamps a few days earlier which otherwise would have killed off half the population of the western hemisphere blinde d the other half and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile so the earth was lucky there he felt strong he felt healthy he vigorously cleared away the junk mail with a spade and then buried the cat just as he was finishing that the phone went but he let it ring while he maintained a moments respectful silence whoever it was would ring back if it was important he kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside there had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of junk ʹ some documents from the council dated three years earlier relating to the proposed demolition of his house and some other letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass scheme in the area there was also an old letter from greenp eace the ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made contributions asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity and some postcards from friends vaguely complaining that he never got in touch these days he collected these together and put them in a cardboard file which he marked things to do since he was feeling so vigorous and dynamic that morning he even added the word urgent he unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from the plast ic bag he had acquired at the port brasta mega ­‐market the slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in lingua centauri which was completely incomprehensible in any other language and therefore entirely pointless for a duty free shop at a spaceport the bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away he realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to earth kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the a he had lost his battered and spaceworn copy of the thing which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had traversed he had lost the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy well he told himself this time i really wont be needing it aga in he had some calls to make he had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his return journey precipitated which was that he would simply brazen it out he phoned the bbc and asked to be put through to his department head oh hello a rthur dent here look sorry i havent been in for six months but ive gone mad oh not to worry thought it was probably something like that happens here all the time how soon can we expect you when do hedgehogs stop hibernating sometime in spring i think ill be in shortly after that rightyho he flipped through the yellow pages and made a short list of numbers to try oh hello is that the old elms hospital yes i was just phoning to see if i could have a word with fenella er fenella ʹ good lord silly me ill forget my own name next er fenella ʹ isnt this ridiculous patient of yours dark haired girl came in last night im afraid we dont have any patients called fenella oh dont you i mean fi ona of course we just call her fen im sorry goodbye click six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his mood of vigorous dynamic optimism and he decided that before it deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it a little he had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable weirdness about himself at a stroke and he whistled to himself as he pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night arthur he grinned cheer fully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from all corners of the pub and told them all what a wonderful time hed had in southern california chapter he accepted another pint and took a pull at it of course i had my own personal alchemis t too you what he was getting silly and he knew it exuberance and hall and woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of but one of the first effects it had is to stop you being wary of things and the point at which arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the point at which he started instead to get inventive oh yes he insisted with a happy glazed smile its why ive lost so much weight what said his audience oh yes he said again the californians have rediscove red alchemy oh yes he smiled again only he said its in a much more useful form than that which in he paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble in his head in which the ancients used to practise it or at least he added failed to practise it they couldnt get it t o work you know nostradamus and that lot couldnt cut it nostradamus said one of his audience i didnt think he was an alchemist said another i thought said a third he was a seer he became a seer said arthur to his audience the c omponent parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little because he was such a lousy alchemist you should know that he took another pull at his beer it was something he had not tasted for eight years he tasted it and tasted it what has al chemy got to do asked a bit of the audience with losing weight im glad you asked that said arthur very glad and i will now tell you what the connection is between he paused between those two things the things you mentioned ill tell y ou he paused and manoeuvred his thoughts it was like watching oil tankers doing three ­‐point turns in the english channel theyve discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold he said in a sudden blur of coherence youre kidding oh yes he said no he corrected himself they have he rounded on the doubting part of his audience which was all of it and so it took a little while to round on it completely have you been to california he demanded do you know the sort of stuff t hey do there three members of his audience said they had and that he was talking nonsense you havent seen anything insisted arthur oh yes he added because someone was offering to buy another round the evidence he said pointing at himsel f and not missing by more than a couple of inches is before your eyes fourteen hours in a trance he said in a tank in a trance i was in a tank i think he added after a thoughtful pause i already said that he waited patiently while the nex t round was duly distributed he composed the next bit of his story in his mind which was going to be something about the tank needing to be orientated along a line dropped perpendicularly from the pole star to a baseline drawn between mars and venus and was about to start trying to say it when he decided to give it a miss long time he said instead in a tank in a trance he looked round severely at his audience to make sure it was all following attentively he resumed where was i he said in a trance said one in a tank said another oh yes said arthur thank you and slowly he said pressing onwards slowly slowly all your excess body fat turns to he paused for effect subcoo subyoo subtoocay ʹ he paus ed for breath ʹ subcutaneous gold which you can have surgically removed getting out of the tank is hell what did you say i was just clearing my throat i think you doubt me i was clearing my throat she was clearing her throat confirmed a significant part of the audience in a low rumble oh yes said arthur all right and you then split the proceeds he paused again for a maths break fifty ­‐fifty with the alchemist make a lot of money he looked swayingly around at his audience and could not help but be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces he felt very affronted by this how else he demanded could i afford to have my face dropped friendly arms began to help him home listen he protested as the cold february breeze brushed his face looking lived ­‐in is all the rage in california at the moment youve got to look as if youve seen the galaxy life i mean youve got to look as if youve seen life thats what i got a face drop give me eight years i said i hope being thirty doesnt come back into fashion or ive wasted a lot of money he lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued to help him along the lane to his house got in y esterday he mumbled im very happy to be home or somewhere very like it jet lag muttered one of his friends long trip from california really mucks you up for a couple of days i dont think hes been there at all muttered another i w onder where he has been and whats happened to him after a little sleep arthur got up and pottered round the house a bit he felt woozy and a little low still disoriented by the journey he wondered how he was going to find fenny he sat and looked at the fish bowl he tapped it again and despite being full of water and a small yellow babel fish which was gulping its way around rather dejectedly it still chimed its deep and resonant chime as clearly and mesmerically as before someone is trying to thank me he thought to himself he wondered who and for what chapter at the third stroke it will be one thirty ­‐two and twenty seconds beep beep beep ford prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction realized that he had no reason to suppress it and laughed out loud a wicked laugh he switched the incoming signal through from the sub ­‐etha net to the ships hi ­‐fi system and the odd rathe r stilted sing ­‐song voice spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin at the third stroke it will be one thirty ­‐two and thirty seconds beep beep beep he tweaked the volume up just a little while keeping a careful eye on a rapidl y changing table of figures on the ships computer display for the length of time he had in mind the question of power consumption became significant he didnt want a murder on his conscience at the third stroke it will be one thirty ­‐two and fo rty seconds beep beep beep he checked around the small ship he walked down the short corridor at the third stroke he stuck his head into the small functional gleaming steel bathroom it will be it sounded fine in there he looked into the tiny sleeping quarters one thirty ­‐two it sounded a bit muffled there was a towel hanging over one of the speakers he took down the towel and fifty seconds fine he checked out the packed cargo hold and wasnt at all satisfied with the sound there was altogether too much crated junk in the way he stepped back out and waited for the door to seal he broke open a closed control panel and pushed the jettison button he didnt know why he hadnt thought of that b efore a whooshing rumbling noise died away quickly into silence after a pause a slight hiss could be heard again it stopped he waited for the green light to show and then opened the door again on the now empty cargo hold one thirty ­‐three and fifty seconds very nice beep beep beep he then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency suspended animation chamber which was where he particularly wanted it to be heard at the third stroke it will be one thirty four precisely he shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted covering at the dim bulk of the form within one day who knew when it would wake and when it did it would know what time it was not exactly local time true but what th e heck he double ­‐checked the computer display above the freezer bed dimmed the lights and checked it again at the third stroke it will be he tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin one thirty ­‐four and twenty seconds the voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone in london which he wasnt not by a long way he gazed out into the inky night the star the size of a brilliant biscuit crumb he could see in the distance was zondostina or as it was known on the wo rld from which the rather stilted sing ­‐song voice was being received pleiades zeta the bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the giant gas planet sesefras magna where the xaxisian battleships docked and just rising over its h orizon was a small cool blue moon epun at the third stroke it will be for twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and epun closed as the ships computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around t he little moon close the loop and keep it there orbiting in perpetual obscurity one fifty ­‐nine his original plan had been to close down all external signalling and radiation from the ship to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were actually looking at it but then hed had an idea he preferred it would now emit one single continuo us beam pencil ­‐thin broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signals origin which it would not reach for four hundred years travelling at light speed but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did beep beep beep he sniggered he didnt like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled or sniggered but he had to admit that he had been giggling and sniggering almost continuously for well over half an hour now at the third strok e the ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit round a little known and never visited moon almost perfect one thing only remained he ran again the computer simulation of the launching of the ships little escape ­‐o­‐buggy balan cing actions reactions tangential forces all the mathematical poetry of motion and saw that it was good before he left he turned out the lights as his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the beginning of its three ­‐day journey t o the orbiting space station port sesefron it rode for a few seconds a long pencil ­‐thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still at the third stroke it will be two thirteen and fifty seconds he giggled and sniggered he would have laughed out loud but he didnt have the room beep beep beep chapter april showers i hate especially however noncommittally arthur grunted the man seemed determined to talk to him he wondered if he should get up and move to another table but there didnt seem to be one free in the whole cafeteria he stirred his coffee fiercely bloody april showers hate hate hate arthur stared frowning out of the window a light sunny spray of rain hung over the motorway t wo months hed been back now slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy people had such extraordinarily short memories including him eight years of crazed wanderings round the galaxy now seemed to him not so much like a bad dream a s like a film he had videotaped from the tv and now kept in the back of a cupboard without bothering to watch one effect that still lingered though was his joy at being back now that the earths atmosphere had closed over his head for good he thought wrongly everything within it gave him extraordinary pleasure looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had to protest well i like them he said suddenly and for all the obvious reasons theyre light and refreshing they sparkle and make you feel good the man snorted derisively thats what they all say he said and glowered darkly from his corner seat he was a lorry driver arthur knew this because his opening unprovoked remark had been im a lorry driver i hate driv ing in the rain ironic isnt it bloody ironic if there was a sequitur hidden in this remark arthur had not been able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt affable but not encouraging but the man had not been deterred then and was not deterred now they all say that about bloody april showers he said so bloody nice so bloody refreshing such charming bloody weather he leaned forward screwing his face up as if he was going to say something about the government what i want to know is this he said if its going to be nice weather why he almost spat cant it be nice without bloody raining arthur gave up he decided to leave his coffee which was too hot to drink qui ckly and too nasty to drink cold well there you go he said and instead got up himself bye he stopped off at the service station shop then walked back through the car park making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain on his face there was even he noticed a faint rainbow glistening over the devon hills he enjoyed that too he climbed into his battered but adored old black golf gti squealed the tyres and headed out past the islands of petrol pumps and on to the slip road back towards th e motorway he was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the earth had closed finally and for ever above his head he was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels had dragged him he was wrong to think he could now forget that the big hard oily dirty rainbow ­‐hung earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the universe he drove on humming being wro ng about all these things the reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a small umbrella his jaw sagged he sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over fenny he shouted having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car he hit her instead with the car door as he leant across and flung it open at her it caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella which then bowled wildly away across the road shit yelled art hur as helpfully as he cold leapt out of his own door narrowly avoided being run down by mckeenas all ­‐weather haulage and watched in horror as it ran down fennys umbrella instead the lorry swept along the motorway and away the umbrella lay like a r ecently swatted daddy ­‐long­‐legs expiring sadly on the ground tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little he picked it up er he said there didnt seem to be a lot of point in offering the thing back to her how did you know my name she said er well he said look ill get you another one he looked at her and tailed off she was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and serious face standing still alone she seemed almost sombre like a statue to some important b ut unpopular virtue in a formal garden she seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked as if she was looking at but when she smiled as she did now it was as if she suddenly arrived from somewhere warmth and life flooded into her face and impossibly graceful movement into her body the effect was very disconcerting and it disconcerted arthur like hell she grinned tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself into the front seat dont worry about the umbrella she said to him as she climbed in it was my brothers and he cant have liked it or he wouldnt have given it to me she laughed and pulled on her seatbelt youre not a friend of my brothers are you no her voice was the only part of her which didnt say good her physical presence there in the car his car was quite extraordinary to arthur he felt as he let the car pull slowly away that he could hardly think or breathe and hoped that neither of these functions were vital to his driving or they were in trou ble so what he had experienced in the other car her brothers car the night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare years in the stars had not been the unbalance of the moment or if it had been he was at least twice as unbalanced now and quite liable to fall off whatever it is that well ­‐balanced people are supposed to be balancing on so he said hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting start he was meant to pick me up ʹ my brother ʹ but phoned to say he couldn t make it i asked about buses but the man started to look at the calendar rather than a timetable so i decided to hitch so so so here i am and what i would like to know is how you know my name perhaps we ought to first sort out said art hur looking back over his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic where im taking you very close he hoped or long away close would mean she lived near him a long way would mean he could drive her there id like to go to taunton she said please if thats all right its not far you can drop me at you live in taunton he said hoping that hed managed to sound merely curious rather than ecstatic taunton was wonderfully close to him he could no london she sai d theres a train in just under an hour it was the worst thing possible taunton was only minutes away up the motorway he wondered what to do and while he was wondering with horror heard himself saying oh i can take you to london let me take you to london bungling idiot why on earth had he said let in that stupid way he was behaving like a twelve ­‐year ­‐old are you going to london she asked i wasnt he said but bungling idiot its very kind of you she said but really no i like to go by train and suddenly she was gone or rather that part of her which brought her to life was gone she looked rather distantly out of the window and hummed lightly to herself he couldnt believe it thirty seconds into the conversat ion and already hed blown it grown men he told himself in flat contradiction of centuries of accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave do not behave like this taunton miles said the signpost he gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled he was going to have to do something dramatic fenny he said she glanced round sharply at him you still havent told me how listen said arthur i will tell you though the story is rather strange very strange she was still looking at him but said nothing listen you said that did i oh there are things i must talk to you about and things i must tell you a story i must tell you which would he was thrashing about he wanted something along the lines of thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular quill t o stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine but didnt think he could carry it off and didnt like the hedgehog reference which would take more than five miles he settled for in the end rather lamely he was afraid well just supposing he said just supposing ʹ he didnt know what was coming next so he thought hed just sit back and listen ʹ that there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important to me and that though you didnt know it i was very import ant to you but it all went for nothing because we only had five miles and i was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say something very important to someone ive only just met and not crash into lorries at the same time what would you say he paused helpl essly and looked at her i should do watch the road she yelped shit he narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred italian washing machines in a german lorry i think she said with a momentary sigh of relief you should buy me a drink before my train goes chapter there is for some reason something especially grim about pubs near stations a very particular kind of grubbiness a special kind of pallor to the pork pies worse than the pork pies though are the sandwiches there is a feeling which persists in england that making a sandwich interesting attractive or in any way pleasant to eat is something sinful that only foreigners do make em dry is the instruction buried somewhere in the collective nati onal consciousness make em rubbery if you have to keep the buggers fresh do it by washing em once a week it is by eating sandwiches in pubs on saturday lunchtimes that the british seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been theyre n ot altogether clear what those sins are and dont want to know either sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about but whatever their sins are they are amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat if there is anything worse t han the sandwiches it is the sausages which sit next to them joyless tubes full of gristle floating in a sea of something hot and sad stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chefs hat a memorial one feels for some chef who hated the world and died forgotten and alone among his cats on a back stair in stepney the sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and wish to atone for something specific there must be somewhere better said arthur no time said fenny glancing at h er watch my train leaves in half an hour they sat at a small wobbly table on it were some dirty glasses and some soggy beermats with jokes printed on them arthur got fenny a tomato juice and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it and a couple of sausages he didnt know why he bought them for something to do while the gas settled in his glass the barman dunked arthurs change in a pool of beer on the bar for which arthur thanked him all right said fenny glancing at her watch tel l me what it is you have to tell me she sounded as well she might extremely sceptical and arthurs heart sank hardly he felt the most conductive setting to try to explain to her as she sat there suddenly cool and defensive that in a sort of out ­‐of­‐body dream he had had a telepathic sense that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the fact that appearances to the contrary nonwithstanding the earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass something whic h he alone on earth knew anything about having virtually witnessed it from a vogon spaceship and that furthermore both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and he needed to got to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible fenny he started i wonder if youd like to buy some tickets for our raffle its just a little one he glanced up sharply to raise money for anjie whos retiring what and needs a kidney machine he was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middle ­‐aged woman with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm and a prim little smile that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot she was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a collecting tin only ten pence each she said so you could probably even buy two without breaking the bank she gave a tinkly little laugh and then a curiously long sigh saying without breaking the bank had obviously given her more pleasure than any thing since some gis had been billeted on her in the war er yes all right said arthur hurriedly digging in his pocket and producing a couple of coins with infuriating slowness and prim theatricality if there was such a thing the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to arthur i do hope you win she said with a smile that suddenly snapped together like a piece of advanced origami the prizes are so nice yes thank you said arthur pocketing the tickets rather brusquely and glancing at his watch he turned towards fenny so did the woman with the raffle tickets and what about you young lady she said its for anjies kidney mach ine shes retiring you see yes she hoisted the little smile even further up her face she would have to stop and let it go soon or the skin would surely split er look here you are said arthur and pushed a fifty pence piece at her in the hope th at that would see her off oh we are in the money arent we said the woman with a long smiling sigh down from london are we no thats all right really he said with a wave of his hand and she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets one by one oh but you must have your tickets insisted the woman or you wont be able to claim your prize theyre very nice prizes you know very suitable arthur snatched the tickets and said thank you as sharply as he could the woman turned to fenny once again and now what about no arthur nearly yelled these are for her he explained brandishing the five new tickets oh i see how nice she smiled sickeningly at both of them well i do hope you yes snapped arthur thank you the woman finally departed to the table next to theirs arthur turned desperately to fenny and was relieved to see that she was rocking with silent laughter he sighed and smiled where were we you were calling me fenny and i was about to ask you not to what do you mean she twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice its why i asked if you were a friend of my brothers or half ­‐ brother really hes the only one who c alls me fenny and im not fond of him for it so whats fenchurch what fenchurch fenchurch she looked at him sternly yes she said and im watching you like a lynx to see if youre going to ask the same silly question that e verybody asks me until i want to scream i shall be cross and disappointed if you do plus i shall scream so watch it she smiled shook her hair a little forward over her face and peered at him from behind it oh he said thats a little unfair i snt it yes fine all right she said with a laugh you can ask me might as well get it over with better than have you call me fenny all the time presumably said arthur weve only got two tickets left you see and since you were so generous when i spoke to you before what snapped arthur the woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty book of cloakroom tickets was now waving the two last ones under his nose i thought id give the opportunity to you beca use the prizes are so nice she wrinkled up he nose a little confidentially very tasteful i know youll like them and it is for anjies retirement present you see we want to give her a kidney machine yes said arthur here he held out t wo more ten pence pieces to her and took the tickets a thought seemed to strike the woman it struck her very slowly you could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach oh dear she said im not interrupting anything am i she peered anxiously at both of them no its fine said arthur everything that could possibly be fine he insisted is fine thank you he added i say she said in a delightful ecstacy of worry youre not in love are you its very hard to say said arthur we havent had a chance to talk yet he glanced at fenchurch she was grinning the woman nodded with knowing confidentiality ill let you see the prizes in a minute she said and left arthur turned with a sigh back to the girl that he found it hard to say whether he was in love with you were about to ask me she said a question yes said arthur we can do it together if you like said fenchurch was i found in a handbag joined in arthur in the left luggage office they said together at fenchurch street station they finished and the answer said fenchurch is no fine said arthur i was conceived there what i was con ʹ in the left lugga ge office hooted arthur no of course not dont be silly what would my parents be doing in the left luggage office she said rather taken aback by the suggestion well i dont know spluttered arthur or rather it was in the ticket queu e the the ticket queue or so they claim they refuse to elaborate they only say you wouldnt believe how bored it is possible to get in the ticket queue at fenchurch street station she sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her wa tch arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two im going to have to go in a minute or two said fenchurch and you havent begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary thing is that you were so keen to get off your chest why don t you let me drive you to london said arthur its saturday ive got nothing particular to do id no said fenchurch thank you its sweet of you but no i need to be by myself for a couple of days she smiled and shrugged but you can tell me another time ill give you my number arthurs heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him now we can relax she said with a slow smile which filled arthur till he thought he would burst fenchurch he said enjoying the name as he said it i ʹ a box said a trailing voice of cherry liqueurs and also and i know youll like this a gramophone record of scottish bagpipe music yes thank you very n ice insisted arthur i just thought id let you have a look at them said the permed woman as youre down from london she was holding them out proudly for arthur too see he could see that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of bagpipe music that was what they were ill let you have your drink in peace now she said patting arthur lightly on his seething shoulder but i knew youd like to see arthur re ­‐engaged his eyes with fenchurchs once again and suddenly was at a loss for something to say a moment had come and gone between the two of them but the whole rhythm of it had been wrecked by that stupid blasted woman dont worry said fen church looking at him steadily from over the top of her glass we will talk again she took a sip perhaps she added it wouldnt have gone so well if it wasnt for her she gave a wry little smile and dropped her hair forward over her face again it was perfectly true he had to admit it was perfectly true chapter that night at home as he was prancing round the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden laughter arthur th ought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won it was eight oclock and he decided he would make himself force himself to listen to the whole record before he phoned her maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow that wou ld be the cool thing to do or next week sometime no no games he wanted her and didnt care who knew it he definitely and absolutely wanted her adored her longed for her wanted to do more things than there were names for with her he actually caug ht himself saying thinks like yippee as he prances ridiculously round the house her eyes her hair her voice everything he stopped he would put on the record of bagpipe music then he would call her would he perhaps call her first no what he would do was this he would put on the record of bagpipe music he would listen to it every last banshee wail of it then he would call her that was the correct order that was what he would do he was worried about touching things in case t hey blew up when he did so he picked up the record it failed to blow up he slipped it out of its cover he opened the record player he turned on the amp they both survived he giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus on to the disc he sat and lis tened solemnly to a scottish soldier he listened to amazing grace he listened to something about some glen or other he thought about his miraculous lunchtime they had just been on the point of leaving when they were distracted by an awful outb reak of yoo ­‐hooing the appallingly permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid bird with a broken wing everyone in the pub turned to them and seemed to be expecting some sort of response they hadnt listened to the bit about how pleased and happy anjie was going to be about the p everyone had helped to raise towards the cost of her kidney machine had been vaguely aware that someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that the yoo ­‐ hooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number arthur discovered that he had he glanced angrily at his watch fenchurch gave him a push go on she said go and get it dont be bad tempered give them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a call and tell me how it went ill want to hear the record go on she flicked his arm and left the regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over ­‐effusive it was after all merely a n album of bagpipe music arthur thought about it and listened to the music and kept on breaking into laughter chapter ring ring ring ring ring ring hello yes yes thats right yes youll ave to speak up theres an awful lot of n oise in ere what no i only do the bar in the evenings its yvonne who does lunch and jim hes the landlord no i wasnt on what youll have to speak up what no dont know anything about no raffle what no dont know nothing about it old on ill call jim the barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over the noisy bar ere jim bloke on the phone says something about hes won a raffle he keeps on saying its ticket and hes won no there was a guy in the pub here won shouted back the barman he says ave we got the ticket well how can he think hes won if he hasnt even got a ticket jim says ow can you think youve won if you avent even got the ticket what she put her hand over the receiver again jim e keeps effing and blinding at me says theres a number on the ticket course there was a number on the ticket it was a bloody raffle ticket wasnt it e says e means its a telephone number on the ti cket put the phone down and serve the bloody customers will you chapter eight hours west sat a man alone on a beach mourning an inexplicable loss he could only think of his loss in little packets of grief at a time because the whole thing was too great to be borne he watched the long slow pacific waves come in along the sand and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to happen as the time came for it not to happen it duly didnt happen and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped beneath the long line of sea and the day was gone the beach was a beach we shall not name because his private house was there but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from los angeles which is described in the new edition of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy in one entry as junky wunky lunky stunky and whats that other word and all kinds of bad stuff woo and in another written only hours later as b eing like several thousand square miles of american express junk mail but without the same sense of moral depth plus the air is for some reason yellow the coastline runs west and then turns north up to the misty bay of san francisco which the guid e describes as a good place to go its very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is also a space traveller starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying hi until youve settled in and got the hang of the place it is best to say no to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you because there are some very strange things going on there some of which an unsuspecting alien could die of the hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and sand palm trees breakers and sunsets are described in the guide as boffo a good one and somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the house of this inconsolable man a man whom many regarded as being insane but this was only as he would tell people because he was one of the many reasons why people thought him insane was because of the peculiarity of his house which even in a land where most peoples houses were peculiar in one way or another was quite extreme in his peculiarness his house was called the outsid e of the asylum his name was simply john watson though he preferred to be called ʹ and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to this ʹ wonko the sane in his house were a number of strange things including a grey glass bowl with eight words e ngraved upon it we can talk of him much later on ʹ this is just an interlude to watch the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it he had lost everything he cared for and was now simply waiting for the end of the world ʹ little realizing that it had already been and gone chapter after a disgusting sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a pub in taunton and finding nothing no raffle ticket no telephone number arthur tried everything he could to find fenchu rch and the more things he tried the more weeks passed he raged and railed against himself against fate against the world and its weather he even in his sorrow and his fury went and sat in the motorway service station cafeteria where hed been jus t before he met her its the drizzle that makes me particularly morose please shut up about the drizzle snapped arthur i would shut up if it would shut up drizzling look but ill tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling shall i no blatter what it will blatter arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly outside world it was a completely pointless place to be he realized and he had been driven there by superstition rather than logic however as if to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact happen fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry driver he had encountered there last time the more he tri ed to ignore him the more he found himself being dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the mans exasperating conversation i think said arthur vaguely cursing himself for even bothering to say this that its easing off ha arthur just shrugged he should go thats what he should do he should just go it never stops raining ranted the lorry driver he thumped the table spilt his tea and actually for a moment appeared to be steaming you cant just walk off without responding t o a remark like that of course it stops raining said arthur it was hardly an elegant refutation but it had to be said it rains all the time raved the man thumping the table again in time to the words arthur shook his head stupid to say it rains all the time he said the mans eyebrows shot up affronted stupid whys it stupid whys it stupid to say it rains all the time if it rains the whole time didnt rain yesterday did in darlington arthur paused w arily you going to ask me where i was yesterday asked the man eh no said arthur but i expect you can guess do you begins with a d does it and it was pissing down there i can tell you you dont want to sit there mate said a passing stranger in overalls to arthur cheerily thats thundercloud corner that is reserved special for old raindrops keep falling on my head here theres one reserved in every motorway caff between here and sunny denmark steer clear is my advi ce swhat we all do hows it going rob keeping busy got your wet ­‐weather tyres on har har he breezed by and went to tell a joke about britt ekland to someone at a nearby table see none of them bastards take me seriously said rob mckeena but he added darkly leaning forward and screwing up his eyes they all know its true arthur frowned like my wife hissed the sole owner and driver of mckeenas all ­‐ weather haulage she says its nonsense and i make a fuss and complain about noth ing but he paused dramatically and darted out dangerous looks from his eyes she always brings the washing in when i phone to say im on me way home he brandished his coffee spoon what do you make of that well i have a book he went on i have a book a diary kept it for fifteen years shows every single place ive ever been every day and also what the weather was like and it was uniformly he snarled orrible all over england scotland wales i been all round the continent ita ly germany back and forth to denmark been to yugoslavia its all marked in and charted even when i went to visit my brother he added in seattle well said arthur getting up to leave at last perhaps youd better show it to someone i wil l said rob mckeena and he did chapter misery dejection more misery and more dejection he needed a project and he gave himself one he would find where his cave had been on prehistoric earth he had lived in a cave not a nice cave a lousy cave but there was no but it had been a totally lousy cave and he had hated it but he had lived in it for five years which made it home of some kind and a person likes to keep tra ck of his homes arthur dent was such a person and so he went to exeter to buy a computer that was what he really wanted of course a computer but he felt he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply went and lashed out a lot of readi es on what people might otherwise mistake as being just a thing to play with so that was his serious purpose to pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric earth he explained this to the man in the shop why said the man in the shop this was a tricky one ok skip that said the man in the shop how well i was hoping you could help me with that the man sighed and his shoulders dropped have you much experience of computers arthur wondered whether to mention eddie the shipb oard computer on the heart of gold who could have done the job in a second or deep thought or ʹ but decided he wouldnt no he said looks like a fun afternoon said the man in the shop but he said it only to himself arthur bought the apple an yway over a few days he also acquired some astronomical software plotted the movements of stars drew rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night and worked away busily at it for weeks cheerfully putting off the conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to which was that the whole project was completely ludicrous rough drawings from memory were futile he didnt even know how long it had been beyond ford pr efects rough guess at the time that it was a couple of million years and he simply didnt have the maths still in the end he worked out a method which would at least produce a result he decided not to mind the fact that with the extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb wild approximations and arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right galaxy he just went ahead and got a result he would call it the right result who would know as it happened through the myriad and unfathomab le chances of fate he got it exactly right though he of course would never know that he just went up to london and knocked on the appropriate door oh i thought you were going to phone me first arthur gaped in astonishment you can only come in for a few minutes said fenchurch im just going out chapter a summers day in islington full of the mournful wail of antique ­‐ restoring machinery fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon so arthur wandered in a blissed ­‐out haze and looked at all the shops which in islington are quite an useful bunch as anyone who regularly needs old woodworking tools boer war helmets drag office furni ture or fish will readily confirm the sun beat down over the roofgardens it beat on architects and plumbers it beat on barristers and burglars it beat on pizzas it beat on estate agents particulars it beat on arthur as he went into a restored furn iture shop its an interesting building said the proprietor cheerfully theres a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby pub it was built for the prince regent apparently so he could make his escape when he needed to you mea n in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine furniture said arthur no said the proprietor not for that reason youll have to excuse me said arthur im terribly happy i see he wandered hazily on and found himself outside th e offices of greenpeace he remembered the contents of his file marked things to do ­‐urgent which he hadnt opened again in the meantime he marched in with a cheery smile and said hed come to give them some money to help free the dolphins very funn y they told him go away this wasnt quite the response he had expected so he tried again this time they got quite angry with him so he just left some money anyway and went back out into the sunshine just after six he returned to fenchurchs house in the alleyway clutching a bottle of champagne hold this she said shoved a stout rope in his hand and disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from which dangled a fat padlock off a bla ck iron bar the house was a small converted stable in a light industrial alleyway behind the derelict royal agricultural hall of islington as well as its large stable doors it also had a normal ­‐looking front door of smartly glazed panelled wood with a b lack dolphin door knocker the one odd thing about this door was its doorstep which was nine feet high since the door was set into the upper of the two floors and presumably had been originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses an old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it was over this that the rope arthur was holding was slung the other end of the rope held a suspended cello the door opened above his head ok said fenchurch pull on the rope steady the cello pass i t up to me he pulled on the rope he steadied the cello i cant pull on the rope again he said without letting go of the cello fenchurch leant down im steadying the cello she said you pull on the rope the cello eased up level wi th the doorway swinging slightly and fenchurch manoeuvred it inside come on up yourself she called down arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the stable doors tingling the bottom room which he had seen briefly before was pretty rough and full of junk a large old cast ­‐iron mangle stood there a surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner there was also arthur was momentarily alarmed to see a pram but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books the floor was old stained concrete excitingly cracked and this was the measure of arthurs mood as he stared up the rickety wooden steps in the far corner even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him an almost unbearably sensual thing an architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do wonderful things with this place said fenchurch chattily as arthur emerged through the floor he keeps on coming round standing in stunned amazement mutte ring about space and objects and events and marvellous qualities of light then says he needs a pencil and disappears for weeks wonderful things have therefore so far failed to happen to it in fact thought arthur as he looked about the upper room w as at least reasonably wonderful anyway it was simply decorated furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set with speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up stonehenge there were flowers which were pale and pictures whi ch were interesting there was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a bed and also a bathroom which fenchurch explained you could actually swing a cat in but she added only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didnt mind a f ew nasty cracks about the head so here you are yes they looked at each other for a moment the moment became a longer moment and suddenly it was a very long moment so long one could hardly tell where all the time was coming from for arthur w ho could usually contrive to feel self ­‐conscious if left alone for long enough with a swiss cheese plant the moment was one of sustained revelation he felt on the sudden like a cramped and zoo­‐born animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his ca ge hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching grey and pink to the distant rising sun while all around new sounds are waking he wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surpr ise he hadnt realized that life speaks with a voice to you a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before which was yes fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last with a tiny shake of her head i know she said i shall have to remember she added that you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes without wi nning a raffle with it she turned away lets go for a walk she said quickly hyde park ill change into something less suitable she was dressed in a rather severe dark dress not a particularly shapely one and it didnt really suit her i wear it specially for my cello teacher she said hes a nice boy but i sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited ill be down in a moment she ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above and called down put the bottle in the fridge for later he noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that it had an identical twin to sit next to he walked over to the window and looked out he turned and started to look at her records from above he heard the rustle of her dress fall to the ground he talked to himself about the sort of person he was he told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on to the spines of her records read the titles nod appreciative ly count the blasted things if he had to he would keep his head down this he completely utterly and abjectly failed to do she was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed hardly to notice that he was looking up at her then suddenly s he shook her head dropped the light sundress over herself and disappeared quickly into the bathroom she emerged a moment later all smiles and with a sunhat and came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness it was a strange kind of dancing motion she had she saw that he noticed it and put her head slightly on one side like it she said you look gorgeous he said simply because she did hmmmm she said as if he hadnt really answered her question she closed the upstairs front door which had stood open all this time and looked around the little room to see that it was all in a fit state to be left on its own for a while arthurs eyes followed hers around and while he was looking in the other dire ction she slipped something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying arthur looked back at her ready did you know she said with a slightly puzzled smile that theres something wrong with me her directness caught arthur unpre pared well he said id heard some vague sort of i wonder how much you do know about me she said i you heard it from where i think you heard then thats not it russell just sort of makes stuff up because he cant deal with what it really is a pang of worry went through arthur then what is it he said can you tell me dont worry she said its nothing bad at all just unusual very very unusual she touched his hand and then leant forward and kissed him briefly i shall be very interested to know she said if you manage to work out what it is this evening arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have chimed like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fishbowl made when he flicked it with his thumbnail chapter ford prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire he slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the noisier machinery in his vicinity and padding it with towels he slung himself down th e access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily they were claustrophobic and ill ­‐lit and what light there was continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that through the ship causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming noises that wasnt it though he paused and leaned back against the wall as something that looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty searing screech that wasnt it either he clambered listlessly through a bulkhe ad door and found himself in a larger corridor though still ill ­‐lit the ship lurched it had been doing this a fair bit but this was heavier a small platoon of robots weent by making a terrible clattering still not it though acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor so he walked along it in the other direction he passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched perspex one of them showed some ho rrible green scaly reptilian figure ranting and raving about the single transferable vote system it was hard to tell whether he was for or against it but he clearly felt very strongly about it ford turned the sound down that wasnt it though he pas sed another monitor it was showing a commercial for some brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you used it there was nasty blaring music with it too but that wasnt it he came upon another much larger three ­‐dimensional scree n that was monitoring the outside of the vast silver xaxisian ship as he watched a thousand horribly beweaponed zirzla robot starcruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon silhouetted against the blinding disc of the star xaxis and the ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them that was it ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes he slumped on the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had bee n burning earlier on but had now cooled down enough to sit on he yawned and dug his copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy out of his satchel he activated the screen and flicked idly through some level three entries and some level four entries he was looking for some good insomnia cures he found rest which was what he reckoned he needed he found rest and recuperation and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea he looked up at the monitor screen the battle was raging more fie rcely every second and the noise was appalling the ship juddered screamed and lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or received he looked back down at the guide again and flipped through a few likely locations he suddenly laughed and then rummaged in his satchel again he pulled out a small memory dump module wiped off the fluff and biscuit crumbs and plugged it into an interface on the back of the guide when all the information that he could think was relevant had been dumpe d into the module he unplugged it again tossed it lightly in the palm of his hand put the guide away in his satchel smirked and went in search of the ships computer data banks chapter the purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings in the summer especially in parks said the voice earnestly is to make girls breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye i am convinced that this is the case arthur and fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they passed she hugged him mo re tightly for a moment and i am certain said the frizzy ginger ­‐haired youth with the long thin nose who was epostulating from his deckchair by the side of the serpentine that if one worked the argument through one would find that it flowed with pe rfect naturalness and logic from everything he insisted to his thin dark ­‐haired companion who was slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected about his spots that darwin was going on about this is certain this is indisputable and he added i love it he turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at fenchurch arthur steered her away and could feel her silently quaking next guess she said when she had stopped giggling come on all right he said your elbow your left elbow theres something wrong with your left elbow wrong again she said completely wrong youre on completely the wrong track the summer sun was sinking through the tress in the park looking as if ʹ lets not mince words hyde park is stunning everything about it is stunning except for the rubbish on monday mornings even the ducks are stunning anyone who can go through hyde park on a summers evening and not feel moved by it is probably going thr ough in an ambulance with the sheet pulled over their face it is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they do elsewhere arthur and fenchurch found a man in shorts practising the bagpipes to himself under a tree the piper paused to c hase off an american couple who had tried timidly to put some coins on the box his bagpipes came in no he shouted at them go away im only practising he started resolutely to reinflate his bag but even the noise this made could not disfigure their mood arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downwards i dont think it can be your bottom he said after a while there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with that at all yes she agreed theres absolutely nothing wrong with my bottom they kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and practised on the other side of the tree ill tell you a story said arthur good they found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath the stunning ducks a story said fenchurch cuddl ing his arm to her which will tell you something of the sort of things that happen to me its absolutely true you know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be something that happened to their wifes cousins best friend but actua lly probably got made up somewhere along the line well its like one of those stories except that it actually happened and i know it actually happened because the person it actually happened to was me like the raffle ticket arthur laughed yes i had a train to catch he went on i arrived at the station did i ever tell you interrupted fenchurch what happened to my parents in a station yes said arthur you did just checking arthur glanced at his watch i suppose we could think of getting back he said tell me the story said fenchurch firmly you arrived at the station i was about twenty minutes early id got the time of the train wrong i suppose it is at least equally possible he added after a moment s reflection that british rail had got the time of the train wrong hadnt occurred to me before get on with it fenchurch laughed so i bought a newspaper to do the crossword and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee you do the crosswor d yes which one the guardian usually i think it tries to be too cute i prefer the times did you solve it what the crossword in the guardian i havent had a chance to look at it yet said arthur im still trying to buy the coffee all right then buy the coffee im buying it i am also said arthur buying some biscuits what sort rich tea good choice i like them la den with all these new possessions i go and sit at a table and dont ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and i cant remember it was probably round all right so let me give you the layout me sitting at the table on my left the newspaper on my right the cup of coffee in the middle of the table the packet of biscuits i see it perfectly what you dont see said arthur because i havent mentioned him yet is the guy sitting at the table already he is sitting there opposite me whats he like perfectly ordinary briefcase business suit he didnt look said arthur as if he w as about to do anything weird ah i know the type what did he do he did this he leaned across the table picked up the packet of biscuits tore it open took one out and what ate it what he ate it fenchurch looked at him in astonishment what on earth did you do well in the circumstances i did what any red ­‐blooded englishman would do i was compelled said arthur to ignore it what why well its not the sort of thing youre trained for is it i searched my s oul and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply calmly sitting right there in front of me stolen one of my biscuits well you could fenchurch thought about it i must say im not sure what i would have done either so what happened i stared furiously at the crossword said arthur couldnt do a single clue took a sip of coffee it was too hot to drink so there was nothing for it i braced myself i took a biscuit trying very hard not to notice he added that the packet was already mysteriously open but youre fighting back taking a tough line after my fashion yes i ate the biscuit i ate it very deliberately and visibly so that he would have no doubt as to what it was i was doing when i eat a biscuit arthur said it stays eaten so what did he do took another one honestly insisted arthur this is exactly what happened he took another biscuit he ate it clear as daylight certain as we are sitting on the ground fenchurch stirred uncomfortably and the problem was said arthur that hav ing not said anything the first time it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around what do you say excuse me i couldnt help noticing er doesnt work no i ignored it with if anything even more vigour than p reviously my man stared at the crossword again still couldnt budge a bit of it so showing some of the spirit that henry v did on st crispins day what i went into the breach again i took said arthur another biscuit and for an instant our eyes met like this yes well no not quite like that but they met just for an instant and we both looked away but i am here to tell you said arthur that there was a little electricity in the air there was a little tension building up over the table at about this time i can imagine we went through the whole packet like this him me him me the whole packet well it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at t his point gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time gladiators said fenchurch would have had to do it in the sun more physically gruelling there is that so when the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up having done his worst and left i heaved a sigh of relief of course as it happened my train was announced a moment or two later so i finished my coffee stood up picked up the newspaper and underneath the newspaper yes were my biscuits what said fenchurch what true no she gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing she sat up again you completely nitwit she hooted you almost completely and utterly foolish person she pushed him backwards rolled over him kis sed him and rolled off again he was surprised at how light she was now you tell me a story i thought she said putting on a low husky voice that you were very keen to get back no hurry he said airily i want you to tell me a story she looked out over the kale and pondered all right she said its only a short one and not funny like yours but anyway she looked down arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of moments the air seemed to stand still around them waiting arthur wished that the air would go away and mind its own business when i was a kid she said these sort of stories always start like this dont they when i was a kid anyway this is the bit where the girl suddenly says when i was a kid and starts to unburden herself we have got to that bit when i was a ki d i had this picture hanging over the foot of my bed what do you think of it so far i like it i think its moving well youre getting the bedroom interest in nice and early we could probably do with some development with the picture it was on e of those pictures that children are supposed to like she said but dont full of endearing little animals doing endearing things you know i know i was plagued with them too rabbits in waistcoats exactly these rabbits were in fact on a raf t as were assorted rats and owls there may even have been a reindeer on the raft on the raft and a boy was sitting on the raft among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer precisely there a boy of the cheery gypsy ragam uffin variety ugh the picture worried me i must say there was an otter swimming in front of the raft and i used to lie awake at night worrying about this otter having to pull the raft with all these wretched animals on it who shouldnt even be on a raft and the otter had such a thin tail to pull it with i thought it must hurt pulling it all the time worried me not badly but just vaguely all the time then one day ʹ and remember id been looking at this picture every night for years ʹ i suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail never seen it before the otter was fine he was just swimming along she shrugged good story she said ends weakly said arthur leaves the audience crying yes but what of it fine up till there but needs a final sting before the credits fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs it was just such a sudden revelation years of almost unnoticed worry just dropping away like taking off heavy weights like black and white becoming colour like a dry sti ck suddenly being watered the sudden shift of perspective that says put away your worries the world is a good and perfect place it is in fact very easy you probably thing im saying that because im going to say that i felt like that this afternoon o r something dont you well i said arthur his composure suddenly shattered well its all right she said i did thats exactly what i felt but you see ive felt that before even stronger incredibly strongly im afraid im a bit of a o ne she said gazing off into the distance for sudden startling revelations arthur was at sea could hardly speak and felt it wiser therefore for the moment not to try it was very odd she said much as one of the pursuing egyptians might have said that the behaviour of the red sea when moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side very odd she repeated for days before the strangest feeling had been building in me as if i was going to give birth no it wasnt like that in fact it was more as if i was being connected into something bit by bit no not even that it was as if the whole of the earth through me was going to does the number said arthur gently forty ­‐two mean anything to you at all what no what are you talking about exclaimed fenchurch just a thought murmured arthur arthur i mean this this is very real to me this is serious i was being perfectly serious said arthur its just the universe im never quite sure about what d o you mean by that tell me the rest of it he said dont worry if it sounds odd believe me you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff he added that is odd and i dont mean biscuits she nodded and seemed to believe him suddenly she gripped his arm it was so simple she said so wonderfully and extraordinarily simple when it came what was it said arthur quietly arthur you see she said thats what i no longer know and the loss is unbearable if i try to think back to it it all goes flickery and jumpy and if i try too hard i get as far as the teacup and i just black out what well like your story she said the best bit happened in a cafe i was sittin g there having a cup of tea this was after days of this build up the feeling of becoming connected up i think i was buzzing gently and there was some work going on at a building site opposite the cafe and i was watching it through the window over th e rim of my teacup which i always find is the nicest way of watching other people working and suddenly there it was in my mind this message from somewhere and it was so simple it made such sense of everything i just sat up and thought oh oh well thats all right then i was so startled i almost dropped my teacup in fact i think i did drop it yes she added thoughtfully im sure i did how much sense am i making it was fine up to the bit about the teacup she shook her head and shook it again as if trying to clear it which is what she was trying to do well thats it she said fine up to the bit about the teacup that was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world exploded what i know it sounds crazy and everybody says it was hallucinations but if that was hallucinations then i have hallucinations in big screen d with ­‐track dolby stereo and should probably hire myself out to people who are bored with shark movies it was as if the ground w as literally ripped from under my feet and and she patted the grass lightly as if for reassurance and then seemed to change her mind about what she was going to say and i woke up in hospital i suppose ive been in and out ever since and thats why i have an instinctive nervousness she said of sudden startling revelations thats everythings going to be all right she looked up at him arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange anomalies surrounding his return to his home world or rather had consigned them to that part of his mind marked things to think about ʹ urgent here is the world he had told himself here for whatever reason is the world and here it stays with me on it but now it seemed to go swimmy around him as it had that night in the car when fenchurchs brother had told him the silly stories about the cia agent in the reservoir the trees went swimmy the lake went swim my but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed by because a grey goose had just landed on it the geese were having a great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know the questions to anyway said fenchurch suddenly and br ightly and with a wide ­‐ eyed smile there is something wrong with part of me and youve got to find out what it is well go home arthur shook his head whats the matter she said arthur had shaken his head not to disagree with her suggestion which he thought was a truly excellent one one of the worlds great suggestions but because he was just for a moment trying to free himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was least expecting it the universe would suddenly leap out fro m behind a door and go boo at him im just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind said arthur you say you felt as if the earth actually exploded yes more than felt which is what everybody else says he said hesitantly is hallucinations yes but arthur thats ridiculous people think that if you just say hallucinations it explains anything you want it to explain and eventually whatever it is you cant understand will just go away its just a word it doesnt explain anyt hing it doesnt explain why the dolphins disappeared no said arthur no he added thoughtfully no he added again even more thoughtfully what he said at last doesnt explain the dolphins disappearing no said arthur i see that w hich dolphins do you mean what do you mean which dolphins im talking about when all the dolphins disappeared she put her hand on his knee which made him realize that the tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his back a nd must instead be one of the nasty creepy feelings he so often got when people were trying to explain things to him the dolphins yes all the dolphins said arthur disappeared yes the dolphins youre saying the dolphins all disappeared is this said arthur trying to be absolutely clear on this point what youre saying arthur where have you been for heavens sake the dolphins all disappeared on the same day i she sta red him intently in his startled eyes what no dolphins all gone vanished she searched his face did you really not know that it was clear from his startled expression that he did not where did they go he asked no one knows that s what vanished means she paused well there is one man who says he knows about it but everyone says he lives in california she said and is mad i was thinking of going to see him because it seems the only lead ive got on what happened to me she shrugged and then looked at him long and quietly she lay her hand on the side of his face i really would like to know where youve been she said i think something terrible happened to you then as well and thats why we recognized each other she glanced around the park which was now being gathered into the clutches of dusk well she said now youve got someone you can tell arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh it is he said a very long story fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag is it anything to do with this she said the thing she took out of her bag was battered and travelworn as it had been hurled into prehistoric rivers baked under the sun that shines so redly on the deserts of kakrafoon half ­‐buried in the marbled sands that fringe the heady vapoured oceans of santraginus v frozen on the glaciers of the moon of jaglan beta sat on kicked around spaceships scuffed and generally abused and since its makers had thought that these were exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it they had thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it in large friendly letters the words dont panic where did you get this said arthur startled taking it from her ah she said i thought it was yours in russells car that night you dropped it have you been to many of these places arthur drew the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy from its cover it was like a small thin flexible lap computer he tapped some bu ttons till the screen flared with text a few he said can we go to them what no said arthur abruptly then relented but relented warily do you want to he said hoping for the answer no it was an act of great generosity on his part not t o say you dont want to do you which expects it yes she said i want to know what the message was that i lost and where it came from because i dont think she added standing up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park that it ca me from here im not even sure she further added slipping her arm around arthurs waist that i know where here is chapter the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is as has been remarked before often and accurately a pretty startling kind of a thing it is essentially as the title implies a guide book the problem is or rather one of the problems for there are many a size able portion of which are continually clogging up the civil commercial and criminal courts in all areas of the galaxy and especially where possible the more corrupt ones this the previous sentence makes sense that is not the problem this is change read it through again and youll get it the galaxy is a rapidly changing place there is frankly so much of it every bit of which is continually on the move continually changing a bit of a nightmare you might think for a scrupulous and consc ientious editor diligently striving to keep this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing circumstances and conditions that the galaxy throws up every minute of every hour of every day and you would be wrong where you would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor like all the editors of the guide has ever had has no real grasp of the meanings of the words scrupulous conscientious or diligent and tends to get his nightmares through a straw entri es tend to get updated or not across the sub ­‐etha net according to if they read good take for example the case of brequinda on the foth of avalars famed in myth legend and stultifyingly dull tri ­‐d mini ­‐serieses as home of the magnificent and magical f uolornis fire dragon in ancient days when fragilis sang and saxaquine of the quenelux held sway when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant but everyone somehow managed to be or so they claimed though how on earth they could have thought that any one was even remotely likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the sweet air and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyones guess virgins it was not possible to heave a brick on brequinda in the foth of avalars without hitting at least half a dozen fuolornis fire dragons whether you would want to do that is another matter not that fire dragons werent an essentially peace ­‐loving species because they were they adored it to bits and this wholesale adoring of things to bits was often in itself the problem one so often hurts the one loves especially if one is a fuolornis fire dragon with breath like a rocket booster and teeth like a park fence another problem was that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a lot of the ones that other people loved as well add to all that the relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the place heaving bricks and you end up with a lot of people on brequinda in the foth of avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons but did they mind they did not were they heard to bemoan their fate no the fuolornis fire dragons were revered throughout the lands of brequinda in the foth of valors for their savage beauty their noble ways and their habit of biting people who didn t revere them why was this the answer was simple sex there is for some unfathomed reason something almost unbearably sexy about having huge fire ­‐breathing magical dragons flying low about the sky on moonlit nights which were already dangerously o n the sweet and fragrant side why this should be so the romance ­‐besotted people of brequinda in the foth of avalars could not have told you and would not have stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going for no sooner would a flock o f half a dozen silk ­‐winged leather ­‐bodied fuolornis fire dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon than half the people of brequinda are scurrying off into the woods with the other half there to spend a busy breathless night together and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still claiming rather endearingly to be virgins if rather flushed and sticky virgins pheromones some researchers said something sonic others claimed the place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it not surprisingly the guides graphically enticing description of the general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonish ingly popular amongst hitch ­‐hikers who allow themselves to be guided by it and so it has simply never been taken out and it is therefore left to latter ­‐day travellers to find out for themselves that todays modern brequinda in the city state of avalars i s now little more than concrete strip joints and dragon burger bars chapter the night in islington was sweet and fragrant there were of course no fuolornis fire dragons about in the alley but if any had chanced by they might just as well h ave sloped off across the road for a pizza for they were not going to be needed had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle of their american hots with extra anchovy they could always have sent across a message to put dire straits on the stereo which is now known to have much the same effect no said fenchurch not yet arthur put dire straits on the stereo fenchurch pushed ajar the upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night air they both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions very close to the open bottle of champagne no said fenchurch not till youve found out whats wrong with me which bit but i suppose she added very very very quietly that we may as well start with w here your hand is now arthur said so which way do i go down said fenchurch on this occasion he moved his hand down she said is in fact the other way oh yes mark knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a schecter custom stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a saturday night exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer ʹ which is not strictly relevant at this point since the record hadnt yet got to that bit but there will be too much else going on whe n it does and furthermore the chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track list and a stopwatch so it seems best to mention it now while things are still moving slowly and so we come said arthur to your knee there is something terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee my left knee said fenchurch is absolutely fine do it is did you know that what ahm its all right i can tell you do no keep going so it has to be something to do with your feet she smiled in the dim light and wriggled her shoulders noncommittally against the cushions since there are cushions in the universe on squornshellous beta to be exact two worlds in from the swampland of the mattresses that actively enjoy being wriggle d against particularly if its noncommittally because of the syncopated way in which the shoulders move its a pity they werent there they werent but such is life arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over carefully all kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point i have to admit he said that i really dont know what im looking for youll know when you find it she said really y ou will there was a slight catch in her voice its not that one feeling increasingly puzzled arthur let her left foot down on the floor and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot she moved forward put her arms round and kissed him because the record had got to that bit which if you knew the record you would know made it impossible not to do this then she gave him her right foot he stroked it ran his fingers round her ankle under her toes along her instep could find no thing wrong with it she watched him with great amusement laughed and shook her head no dont stop she said but its not that one now arthur stopped and frowned at her left foot on the floor dont stop he stroked her right foot ran his fingers around her ankle under her toes along her instep and said you mean its something to do with which leg im holding she did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy into the life of a simple cushion from squornshellous beta he frowned pick me up she said quietly he let her right foot down to the floor and stood up so did she he picked her up in his arms and they kissed again this went on for a while then she said now put me down again still puzzled he did so well she looked at him almost challengingly so whats wrong with my feet she said arthur still did not understand he sat on the floor then got down on his hands and knees to look at her feet in situ as it were in their normal habitat and as he looked closely something odd struck him he pit his head right down to the ground and peered there was a long pause he sat back heavily yes he said i see whats wrong with your feet they dont touch the ground so so what do you think arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension making her eyes suddenly dark she bit her lip and was trembling what do she stammered are you she shook the hair forwards over her eyes that were filling with dark fea rful tears he stood up quickly put his arms around her and gave her a single kiss perhaps you can do what i can do he said and walked straight out of her upstairs front door the record got to the good bit chapter the battle raged on about the star of xaxis hundreds of the fierce and horribly beweaponed zirzla ships had now been smashed and wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver xaxisian ship was able to deploy part of the moon had gone too blasted away by those same blazing forceguns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed through it the zirzla ships that remained horribly beweaponed though they were were now hopelessly outclassed by the devasta ting power of the xaxisian ship and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon when the xaxisian ship in hurtling pursuit behind them suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left the field of battle all was redoubled fear a nd consternation for a moment but the ship was gone with the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast tracts of irrationally shaped space quickly effortlessly and above all quietly deep in his greasy smelly bunk fashioned out of a maintenance hatchway ford prefect slept among his towels dreaming of old haunts he dreamed at one point in his slumbers of new york in his dream he was walking late at night along the east side beside the river which had become so extravagantly poll uted that new lifeforms were now emerging from it spontaneously demanding welfare and voting rights one of those now floated past waving ford waved back the thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank hi it said ive just been creat ed im completely new to the universe in all respects is there anything you can tell me phew said ford a little nonplussed i can tell you where some bars are i guess what about love and happiness i sense deep needs for things like that i t said waving its tentacles got any leads there you can get some like what you require said ford on seventh avenue i instinctively feel said the creature urgently that i need to be beautiful am i youre pretty direct arent you no point in mucking about am i to me said ford no but listen he added after a moment most people make out you know are there and like you down there search me buster said the creature as i said im new here life is entirely str ange to me whats it like here was something that ford felt he could speak about with authority life he said is like a grapefruit er how so well its sort of orangey ­‐yellow and dimpled on the outside wet and squidgy in the middle it s got pips inside too oh and some people have half a one for breakfast is there anyone else out there i can talk to i expect so said ford ask a policeman deep in his bunk ford prefect wriggled and turned on to his other side it wasnt his favourite type of dream because it didnt have eccentrica gallumbits the triple ­‐breasted whore of eroticon vi in it whom many of his dreams did feature but at least i t was a dream at least he was asleep chapter luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because arthur hadnt done this sort of thing for a while at least not deliberately and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it he swung down sharply nearly catching himself a nasty crack on the jaw with the doorstep and tumbled through the air so suddenly stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground and didnt a nice trick he thought to himself if you can do it the ground was hanging menacingly above his head he tried not to think about the ground what an extraordinarily big thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop hangin g there and suddenly fell on him he tried to think nice thoughts about lemurs instead which was exactly the right thing to do because he couldnt at that moment remember precisely what a lemur was if it was one of those things that sweep in great majest ic herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wildebeests so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without simply resorting to an icky sort of general well ­‐disposedness towards things and all this kept his mind well oc cupied while his body tried to adjust to the fact that it wasnt touching anything a mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway after a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually allowed the wind to ease it fluttering between him and the ground arthur the ground was still hanging menacingly above his head and he thought it was probably time to do something about that such as fall away from it which is what he did slowly very very slowly as he fell slowly very very slowly he closed his eyes ʹ carefully so as not to jolt anything the feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body once it had reached his feet and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it he slowly very very slowly revolved his body one way and his mind the other that should sort the ground out he could feel the air clear about him now breezing around him quite cheerfully untroubled by his being there and slowly very very slowly as from a deep and distant sleep he opened his eyes he had flown before of course flown many times on krikkit until all the birdtalk had driven him scatty but this was different here he was on his own world quietly and without fuss beyond a slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of things being in the air ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards off to the right the yellow street lights of upper street luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed to see it through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the evening was beginning to draw in he was therefore safely shrouded in a blanket of dark obscurity he slowly very very slowly lifted his head to fenchurch w ho was standing in silent breathless amazement silhouetted in her upstairs doorway her face was inches from his i was about to ask you she said in a low trembly voice what you were doing but then i realized that i could see what you were doing you were flying so it seemed she went on after a slight wondering pause like a bit of a silly question arthur said can you do it no would you like to try she bit her lip and shook her head not so much to say no but just in sheer bewilderment she was shaking like a leaf its quite easy urged arthur if you dont know how thats the important bit be not at all sure how youre doing it just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the alley fell upwards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to her like a banknote on a breath of wind ask me how i did that how did you do that no idea not a clue she shrugged in bewilderment so how can i arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand i want you to try he said to step on my hand just one foot what try it nervously hesitantly al most she told herself as if she was trying to step on the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in midair she stepped on to his hand now the other what take the weight off your back foot i cant try it like this like that nervously hesitantly almost she told herself as if ʹ she stopped telling herself what she was doing was like because she had a feeling she didnt altogether want to know she fixed her eyes very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks because it was clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone was going to do anything about it or whether she ought to say something to somebody and didnt think for a moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasnt standing on anything at all now said arthur take your weight off your left foot she thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company who had their offices round the corner an d took the weight off her left foot so she should probably go and see them about the gutter now said arthur take the weight off your right foot i cant try she hadnt seen the guttering from quite this angle before and it looked to her now as if as well as the mud and gunge up there might also be a birds nest if she leaned forward just a little and took her weight off her right foot she could probably see it more clearly arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was trying to steal her bicycle he particularly didnt want to get involved in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy would do it quietly and not look up he had the qu iet shifty look of someone who habitually stole bicycles in alleys and habitually didnt expect to find their owners hovering several feet above them he was relaxed by both these habits and went about his job with purpose and concentration and when he f ound that the bike was unarguably bound by hoops of tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete he peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way arthur let out a long ­‐held breath see what a piece of eggshell i have found you said fenchurch in his ear chapter those who are regular followers of the doings of arthur dent may have received an impression of his character and habits which while it includes the truth and o f course nothing but the truth falls somewhat short in its composition of the whole truth in all its glorious aspects and the reasons for this are obvious editing selection the need to balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant and cut out all the tedious happenstance like this for instance arthur dent went to bed he went up the stairs all fifteen of them opened the door went into his room took off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes one by one and l eft them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor he put on his pyjamas the blue ones with the stripe he washed his face and hands cleaned his teeth went to the lavatory realized that he had once again got this all in the wrong order had to wash his h ands again and went to bed he read for fifteen minutes spending the first ten minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to the previous night then he turned out the light and within a minute or so more was asleep it was dark he lay on his left side for a good hour after that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and then turned over to sleep on his right side another hour after this his eyes flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his nose though there was still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back on to his left side and so he whiled the night away sleeping at four he got up and went to the lavatory again he opened the door to the lavatory and so on its guff it doesnt advance the acti on it makes for nice fat books such as the american market thrives on but it doesnt actually get you anywhere you dont in short want to know but there are other omissions as well beside the teethcleaning and trying to find fresh socks variety an d in some of these people have often seemed inordinately interested what they want to know about all that stuff off in the wings with arthur and trillian did that ever get anywhere to which the answer is of course mind your own business and what they say was he up to all those nights on the planet krikkit just because the planet didnt have fuolornis fire dragons or dire straits doesnt mean that everyone just sat up every night reading or to take a more specific example what about the nigh t after the committee meeting party on prehistoric earth when arthur found himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl called mella recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the planet golgafrincham what then what happened next and the answer is of course that the book ended the ne xt one didnt resume the story till five years later and you can claim some take discretion too far this arthur dent comes the cry from the furthest reaches of the galaxy and has even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe though t to originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to contemplate what is he man or mouse is he interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life has he no spirit has he no passion does he not to put it in a nutshell fuck those who wish to know should read on others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has marvin in it chapter arthur dent allowed himself for an unworthy moment to think as they drifted up that he very much hoped that his friends who had always found him pleasant but dull or more latterly odd but dull were having a good time in the pub but that was the last time for a while that he thought of them they drifted up spiralling slowly around each other like sycamore seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn except going the other way and as they drifted up their minds sang with the ecstatic knowled ge that either what they were doing was completely and utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up to do physics shook its head and looking the other way concentrated on keeping the cars going along the euston road and out t owards the westway flyover on keeping the streetlights lit and on making sure that when somebody on baker street dropped a cheeseburger it went splat upon the ground dwindling headily beneath them the beaded strings of light of london ʹ london arthur had to keep reminding himself not the strangely coloured fields of krikkit on the remote fringes of the galaxy lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky above them but london ʹ swayed swaying and turning turned try a swoop he call ed to fenchurch what her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast empty air it was breathy and faint with disbelief ʹ all those things clear faint distant breathy all at the same time were flying she said a trifle c alled arthur think nothing of it try a swoop a sw ʹ her hand caught his and in a second her weight caught it too and stunningly she was gone tumbling beneath him clawing wildly at nothing physics glanced at arthur and clotted with horror he was gone too sick with giddy dropping every part of him screaming but his voice they plummeted because this was london and you really couldnt do this sort of thing here he couldnt catch her because this was london and not a million miles from here seven hundred and fifty ­‐six to be exact in pisa galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies fell at exactly the same rate of acceleration irrespective of thei r relative weights they fell arthur realized as he fell giddily and sickeningly that if he was going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the italians had to say about physics when they couldnt even keep a simple tower straight that they were in dead trouble and damn well did fall faster than fenchurch he grappled her from above and fumbled for a tight grip on her shoulders he got it fine they were now falling together which was all very sweet and romantic but didnt solve t he basic problem which was that they were falling and the ground wasnt waiting around to see if he had any more clever tricks up his sleeve but was coming up to meet them like an express train he couldnt support her weight he hadnt anything he cou ld support it with or against the only thing he could think was that they were obviously going to die and if he wanted anything other than the obvious to happen he was going to have to do something other than the obvious here he felt he was on familiar territory he let go of her pushed her away and when she turned her face to him in a gasp of stunned horror caught her little finger with his little finger and swung her back upwards tumbling clumsily up after her shit she said as she sat pantin g and breathless on absolutely nothing at all and when she had recovered herself they fled on up into the night just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had impossibly come the ground was something not to regard with any too firm or st eady an eye but merely to glance at as it were in passing fenchurch tried some little swoops daringly and found that if she judged herself just right against a body of wind she could pull off some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette a t the end followed by a little drop which made her dress billow around her and this is where readers who are keen to know what marvin and ford prefect have been up to all this while should look ahead to later chapters because arthur now could wait no lo nger and helped her take it off it drifted down and away whipped by the wind until it was a speck which finally vanished and for various complicated reasons revolutionized the life of a family on hounslow over whose washing line it was discovered draped in the morning in a mute embra ce they drifted up till they were swimming amongst the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering around the wings of an aeroplane but never feel because you are sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane and looking through the little scratchy p erspex window while somebody elses son tries patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt arthur and fenchurch could feel them wispy cold and thin wreathing round their bodies very cold very thin they felt even fenchurch now protected from the ele ments by only a couple of fragments from marks and spencer that if they were not going to let the force of gravity bother them then mere cold or paucity of atmosphere could go and whistle the two fragments from marks and spencer which as fenchurch rose now into the misty body of the clouds arthur removed very very slowly which is the only way its possible to do it when youre flying and also not using your hands went on to create considerable havoc in the morning in respectively counting from to p to bottom isleworth and richmond they were in the cloud for a long time because it was stacked very high and when finally they emerged wetly above it fenchurch slowly spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising tidepool they found that above the c louds is where the night get seriously moonlit the light is darkly brilliant there are different mountains up there but they are mountains with their own white arctic snows they had emerged at the top of the high ­‐stacked cumulo ­‐nimbus and now began lazily to drift down its contours as fenchurch eased arthur in turn from his clothes prised him free of them till all were gone winding their surprised way down into the enveloping whiteness she kissed him kissed his neck his chest and soon they w ere drifting on turning slowly in a kind of speechless t ­‐shape which might have caused even a fuolornis fire dragon had one flown past replete with pizza to flap its wings and cough a little there were however no fuolornis fire dragons in the clo uds nor could there be for like the dinosaurs the dodos and the greater drubbered wintwock of stegbartle major in the constellation fraz and unlike the boeing which is in plentiful supply they are sadly extinct and the universe shall never know t heir like again the reason that a boeing crops up rather unexpectedly in the above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very similar happened in the lives of arthur and fenchurch a moment or two later they are big things terrifying ly big you know when one is in the air with you there is a thunderous attack of air a moving wall of screaming wind and you get tossed aside if you are foolish enough to be doing anything remotely like what arthur and fenchurch were doing in its close vicinity like butterflies in the blitz this time however there was a heart ­‐sickening fall or loss of nerve a re­‐grouping moments later and a wonderful new idea enthusiastically signalled through the buffeting noise mrs e kapelsen of boston mass achusetts was an elderly lady indeed she felt her life was nearly at an end she had seen a lot of it been puzzled by some but she was a little uneasy to feel at this late stage bored by too much it had all been very pleasant but perhaps a little t oo explicable a little too routine with a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shutter and looked out over the wing at first she thought she ought to call the stewardess but then she thought no damn it definitely not this was for her and her alone by the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off the wing and tumbled into the slipstream she had cheered up an awful lot she was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong the following morning arthur and fenchurch slept very late in the alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored the following night they did it all over again only this time with sony walkmen chapter this is all very wonderful said fenchurch a few days later but i do need to know what has happened to me you see theres this difference between us that you lost something and found it again and i found something and lost it i need to find it again she had to go out for the day so arthur settled down for a day of telephoning murray bost henson was a journalist on one of the papers with small pages and big print it would be pleasant to be able to say that he was none the worse for it but sadly t his was not the case he happened to be the only journalist that arthur knew so arthur phoned him anyway arthur my old soup spoon my old silver turreen how particularly stunning to hear from you someone told me youd gone off into space or something murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he had invented for his own use and which no one else was able to speak or even to follow hardly any of it meant anything at all the bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfull y buried that no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalance of nonsense the time when you did find out later which bits he did mean was often a bad time for all concerned what said arthur just a rumour my old elephant tusk my little green baize card table just a rumour probably means nothing at all but i may need a quote from you nothing to say just pub talk we thrive on it my old prosthetic limb we thrive on it plus it would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the other stories of the week so it could be just to have you denying it excuse me something has just fallen out of my ear there was a slight pause at the end of which murray bost henson came b ack on the line sounding genuinely shaken just remembered he said what an odd evening i had last night anyway my old i wont say what how do you feel about having ridden on halleys comet i havent said arthur with a suppressed sigh ridde n on halleys comet ok how do you feel about not having ridden on halleys comet pretty relaxed murray there was a pause while murray wrote this down good enough for me arthur good enough for ethel and me and the chickens fits in with th e general weirdness of the week week of the weirdos were thinking of calling it good eh very good got a ring to it first we have this man it always rains on what its the absolute stocking top truth all documented in his little black book it all checks out at every single funloving level the met office is going ice cold thick banana whips and funny little men in white coats are flying in from all over the world with their little rulers and boxes and drip feeds this man is the bee s knees arthur he is the wasps nipples he is i would go so far as to say the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the western world were calling him the rain god nice eh i think ive met him good ring to it what did you say i may have met him complains all the time yes incredible you met the rain god if its the same guy i told him to stop complaining and show someone his book there was an impressed pause from murray bost hensons end of the pho ne well you did a bundle an absolute bundle has absolutely been done by you listen do you know how much a tour operator is paying that guy not to go to malaga this year i mean forget irrigating the sahara and boring stuff like that this guy has a whole new career ahead of him just avoiding places for money the mans turning into a monster arthur we might even have to make him win the bingo listen we may want to do a feature on you arthur the man who made the rain god rain got a ring to i t eh a nice one but we may need to photograph you under a garden shower but thatll be ok where are you er im in islington listen murray islington yes well what about the real weirdness of the week the real seriously loopy stuff you know anything about these flying people no you must have this is the real seethingly crazy one this is the real meatballs in the batter locals are phoning in a ll the time to say theres this couple who go flying nights weve got guys down in our photo labs working through the night to put together a genuine photograph you must have heard no arthur where have you been oh space right i got your quot e but that was months ago listen its night after night this week my old cheesegrater right on your patch this couple just fly around the sky and start doing all kinds of stuff and i dont mean looking through walls or pretending to be box girder br idges you dont know anything no arthur its been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with you chumbum but i have to go ill send the guy with the camera and the hose give me the address im ready and writing listen murray i call ed to ask you something i have a lot to do i just wanted to find out something about the dolphins no story last years news forget em theyre gone its important listen no one will touch it you cant sustain a story you know when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever the storys about not our territory anyway try the sundays maybe theyll run a little whatever happened to whatever happened to the dolphins story in a couple of years around august but whats anybody going to do now dolphins still gone continuing dolphin absence dolphins ʹ further days without them the story dies arthur it lies down and kicks its little feet in the air and presently goes to the great golden spike in the sky my old fruitbat murray im not interested in whether its a story i just want to find out how i can get in touch with that guy in california who claims to know something about it i thought you might know chapter people are beginning to talk said fenchurch that evening after they had hauled her cello in not only talk said arthur but print in big bold letters under the bingo prizes which is why i thought id better get these he showed her the long n arrow booklets of airline tickets arthur she said hugging him does that mean you managed to talk to him i have had a day said arthur of extreme telephonic exhaustion i have spoken to virtually every department of virtually every paper in fleet street and i finally tracked his number down youve obviously been working hard youre drenched with swe at poor darling not with sweat said arthur wearily a photographers just been i tried to argue but ʹ never mind the point is yes you spoke to him i spoke to his wife she said he was too weird to come to the phone right now and could i call back he sat down heavily realized he was missing something and went to the fridge to find it want a drink would commit murder to get one i always know im in for a tough time when my cello teacher looks me up and down and says ah yes my dear i think a little tchaikovsky today i called again said arthur and she said that he was light years from the phone and i should call back ah i called again she said the situation had improved he was now a mere light year s from the phone but it was still a long way to shout you dont suppose said fenchurch doubtfully that theres anyone else we can talk to it gets worse said arthur i spoke to someone on a science magazine who actually knows him and he sai d that john watson will not only believe but will actually have absolute proof often dictated to him by angels with golden beards and green wings and doctor scholl footwear that the months most fashionable silly theory is true for people who question the validity of these visions he will triumphantly produce the clogs in question and thats as far as you get i didnt realize it was that bad said fenchurch quietly she fiddled listlessly with the tickets i phoned mrs watson again said arthu r her name by the way and you may wish to know this is arcane jill i see im glad you see i thought you mightnt believe any of this so when i called her this time i used the telephone answering machine to record the call he went across t o the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed with all its buttons for a while because it was the one which was particularly recommended by which magazine and is almost impossible to use without going mad here it is he said at last wiping the sweat from his brow the voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary satellite and back but it was also hauntingly calm perhaps i should explain arcane jill watsons voice said that the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes i nto its in the asylum you see wonko the sane does not like to enter the asylum and so he does not i feel you should know this because it may save you phoning if you would like to meet him this is very easily arranged all you have to do is walk in h e will only meet people outside the asylum arthurs voice at its most mystified im sorry i dont understand where is the asylum where is the asylum arcane jill watson again have you ever read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks on the tape arthurs voice had to admit that he had not you may want to do that you may find that it clarifies things for you a little you may find that it indicates to you where the asylum is thank you the sound of the phone line went dead arthu r turned the machine off well i suppose we can regard that as an invitation he said with a shrug i actually managed to get the address from the guy on the science magazine fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown and looked at t he tickets again do you think its worth it she said well said arthur the one thing that everyone i spoke to agrees on apart from the fact that they all thought he was barking mad is that he does know more than any man living about dolphins chapter this is an important announcement this is flight to los angeles if your travel plans today do not include los angeles now would be the perfect time to disembark chapter they rented a car in los angeles from one of the places that rents out cars that other people have thrown away getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem said the guy behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys sometimes its simpler just to get out and find a car thats going in that direction they stayed for one night in a hotel on sunset boulevard which someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by everyone there is either english or odd or both theyve got a swimming pool where you can go and watch english rock stars reading langu age truth and logic for the photographers it was true there was one and that was exactly what he was doing the garage attendant didnt think much of their car but that was fine because they didnt either late in the evening they drove through the hollywood hills along mulholland drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea of floating light that is los angeles and later stopped to look across the dazzling sea of floating light that is the san fernando valley they agreed that the sen se of dazzle stopped immediately at the back of their eyes and didnt touch any other part of them and came away strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle as dramatic seas of light went it was fine but light is meant to illuminate something and having driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was illuminating they didnt think much of it they slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was stupidly hot they drove out along the freeway to santa monica for their first look at the pacific ocean the ocean which wonko the sane spent all his days and a good deal of his nights looking at someone told me said fenchurch that they once overheard two old ladies on this beach doing what were doing looking at the pacific oce an for the first time in their lives and apparently after a long pause one of them said to the other you know its not as big as i expected their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the western half of the sky and by the time they were back in their rattling car and driving towards a sunset that no one of any sensibility would dream of building a city like los angeles on front of they were suddenly feeling astonishingly and irrationally happy and didnt even mind that the terrible old car radio would only play two stations and those simultaneously so what they were both playing good rock and roll i know he will be able to help us said fenchurch determinedly i know he will whats his name again that he likes to be called wonko the sane i know that he will be able to help us arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would and hoped that what fenchurch had lost could be found here on this earth whatever this earth might prove to be he hoped as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time they had talked together on the banks of the serpentine that he would not be called upon to try to remember something that he had very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest recess es of his memory where he hoped it would cease to nag at him in santa barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed to be a converted warehouse fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious arthur had a swordfish steak and said it m ade him angry he grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her whys this fish so bloody good he demanded angrily please excuse my friend said fenchurch to the startled waitress i think hes having a nice day at last chapter if you took a couple of david bowies and stuck one of the david bowies on the top of the other david bowie then attached another david bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first two david bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty beach robe you would then have something which didnt exactly look like john watson but which those who knew him would find hauntingly familiar he was tall and he gangled when he sat in his deckchair gazing at the pacific not so much with any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the deckchair ended and he began and you would hesitate to put your hand on say his forearm in case the whole structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took your thumb off but his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable it seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to you but which when he briefly reassembled them in that particular order on his face made you suddenly fee oh well thats all right then when he spoke you were glad that he used the smile that made you feel like that pretty often oh yes he said they come and see me they sit right here they sit right where youre sitting he was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green wings and dr scholl sandals they eat nachos which they say they cant get where they come from they do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole range of things do they said arthur are they so er when is this then when do they come he gazed out at the pacific as well there were little sandpipers running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this problem they needed to find their food i n the sand which a wave had just washed over but they couldnt bear to get their feet wet to deal with this problem they ran with an odd kind of movement as if theyd been constructed by somebody very clever in switzerland fenchurch was sitting on the sand idly drawing patterns in it with her fingers weekends mostly said wonko the sane on little scooters they are great machines he smiled i see said arthur i see a tiny cough from fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked round at her she had scratched a little stick figure drawing in the sand of the two of them in the clouds for a moment he thought she was trying to get him excited then he realized that she was rebuking him who are we she was saying to say hes mad his house was certainly peculiar and since this was the first thing that fenchurch and arthur had encountered it would help to know what it was like what it was like was this it was inside out actually inside out to the extent that they had to park on the carpet all along what one would normally call the outer wall which was decorated in a tasteful interior ­‐designed pink were bookshelves also a couple of those odd three ­‐legged tables with semi ­‐circular tops which stand in such a way as to sugge st that someone just dropped the wall straight through them and pictures which were clearly designed to soothe where it got really odd was the roof it folded back on itself like something that maurits c escher had he been given to hard nights on the town which is no part of this narratives purpose to suggest was the case though it is sometimes hard looking at his pictures particularly the one with the awkward steps not to wonder might have dreamed up after having been on one for the little ch andeliers which should have been hanging inside were on the outside pointing up confusing the sign above the front door said come outside and so nervously they had inside of course was where the outside was rough brickwork nicely done paint ing guttering in good repair a garden path a couple of small trees some rooms leading off and the inner walls stretched down folded curiously and opened at the end as if by an optical illusion which would have had maurits c escher frowning and wo ndering how it was done to enclose the pacific ocean itself hello said john watson wonko the sane good they thought to themselves hello is something we can cope with hello they said and all surprisingly was smiles for quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the dolphins looking oddly distracted and saying i forget whenever they were mentioned and had shown them quite proudly round the eccentricities of his house it gives me pleasure he said in a curious kind of way and does nobody any harm he continued that a competent optician couldnt correct they liked him he had an open engaging quality and seemed able to mock himself before anybody else did your wife said arthur looking around menti oned some toothpicks he said it with a hunted look as if he was worried that she might suddenly leap out from behind the door and mention them again wonko the sane laughed it was a light easy laugh and sounded like one he had used a lot before and w as happy with ah yes he said thats to so with the day i finally realized that the world had gone totally mad and built the asylum to put it in poor thing and hoped it would get better this was the point at which arthur began to feel a little n ervous again here said wonko the sane we are outside the asylum he pointed again at the rough brickwork the pointing and the guttering go through that door he pointed at the first door through which they had originally entered and you go in to the asylum ive tried to decorate it nicely to keep the inmates happy but theres very little one can do i never go in there now myself if ever i am tempted which these days i rarely am i simply look at the sign written over the door and shy away that one said fenchurch pointing rather puzzled at a blue plaque with some instructions written on it yes they are the words that finally turned me into the hermit i have now become it was quite sudden i saw them and i knew what i had to do the sign said hold stick near centre of its length moisten pointed end in mouth insert in tooth space blunt end next to gum use gentle in ­‐out motion it seemed to me said wonko the sane that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks was no longer a civilization in which i could live and stay sane he gazed out at the pacific again as if daring it to rave and gibber at him but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers and in case it crossed your mind to wonder as i can see how it possibly might i am completely sane which is why i call myself wonko the sane just to reassure people on this point wonko is what my mother called me when i was a kid and clumsy and knocked things over and sane is what i am and how he added with one of his smiles that made you feel oh well thats all right then i intend to remain shall we go on to the beach and see what we have to talk about they went out on to the beach which was where he started talking about angels with golden beards and green wings and dr scholl sandals about the dolphins said fenchurch gently hopefully i can show you the sandals said wonko the sane i won der do you know would you like me to show you said wonko the sane the sandals i have them ill get them they are made by the dr scholl company and the angels say that they particularly suit the terrain they have to work in they say they ru n a concession stand by the message when i say i dont know what that means they say no you dont and laugh well ill get them anyway as he walked back towards the inside or the outside depending on how you looked at it arthur and fenchurch looke d at each other in a wondering and slightly desperate sort of way then each shrugged and idly drew figures in the sand how are the feet today said arthur quietly ok it doesnt feel so odd in the sand or in the water the water touches them perfe ctly i just think this isnt our world she shrugged what do you think he meant she said by the message i dont know said arthur though the memory of a man called prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him when wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned arthur not the sandals they were perfectly ordinary wooden ­‐ bottomed sandals i just thought youd like to see he said what angels wear on their feet just out of curiousity im not trying to prove anything by the way im a scientist and i know what constitutes proof but the reason i call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child if he sees a thing he must say that he sees it whether it was what he thought he was going to see or not see first think later then test but always see first otherwise you will only see what you were expecting most scientists forget that ill show you something to demonstrate that later so the other reason i call myself wonko the sane is so that people will think i am a fool that allows me to say what i see when i see it you cant possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that youre a fool anyway i also thought you might like to see this this was the thing that arthur had been stunned to see him carrying for it was a wonderful silver ­‐grey glass fish bowl seemingly identical to the one in arthurs bedroom arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now without success t o say where did you get that sharply and with a gasp in his voice finally his time had come but he missed it by a millisecond where did you get that said fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in her voice arthur glanced at fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice said what have you seen one of these before yes she said ive got one or at least i did have russell nicked it to put his golfballs in i dont know where it came from just that i was angry with russell for nicking i t why have you got one yes it was they both became aware that wonko the sane was glancing sharply backwards and forwards between them and trying to get a gasp in edgeways you have one of those too he said to both of them yes they bot h said it he looked long and calmly at each of them then he held up the bowl to catch the light of the californian sun the bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun to chime with the intensity of its light and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the sand and upon them he turned it and turned it they could see quite clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words so long and thanks for all the fish do you know asked wonko quietly what it is they each shook their heads slowly and with wonder almost hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey glass it is a farewell gift from the dolphins said wonko in a low quiet voice the dolphins whom i loved and studied and swam with and fed with fish and even trie d to learn their language a task which they seemed to make impossibly difficult considering the fact that i now realize they were perfectly capable of communicating in ours if they decided they wanted to he shook his head with a slow slow smile and then looked again at fenchurch and then at arthur have you he said to arthur what have you done with yours may i ask you that er i keep a fish in it said arthur slightly embarrassed i happened to have this fish i was wondering what to do with and er there was this bowl he tailed off youve done nothing else no he said if you had you would know he shook his head again my wife kept wheatgerm in ours resumed wonko with some new tone in his voice until last night what said arthur slowly and hushedly happened last night we ran out of wheatgerm said wonko evenly my wife he added has gone to get some more he seemed lost with his own thoughts for a moment and what happened then said fenchurch in the same breathless tone i washed it said wonko i washed it very carefully very very carefully removing every last speck of wh eatgerm then i dried it slowly with a lint ­‐free cloth slowly carefully turning it over and over then i held it to my ear have you have you held one to your ear they both shook their heads again slowly again dumbly perhaps he said you s hould chapter the deep roar of the ocean the break of waves on further shores than thought can find the silent thunders of the deep and from among it voices calling and yet not voices humming trillings wordlings the half ­‐articulated songs of thought greetings waves of greetings sliding back down into the inarticulate words breaking together a crash of sorrow on the shores of earth waves of joy on ʹ where a world indescribably found indescribably arrived at indescribably wet a song of water a fugue of voices now clamouring explanations of a disaster unavertable a world to be destroyed a surge of helplessness a spasm of despair a dying fall again the break of words and then the fling of hope the finding of a shadow earth in the implications of enfolded time submerged dimensions the pull of parallels the deep pull the spin of

humans we bid you farewell and then the sound of long heavy perfectly grey bodies rolling away into an unknown fathomless deep quietly giggling chapter that night they stayed outside the asylum and watched tv from inside it this is what i wanted you to see said wonk o the sane when the news came around again an old colleague of mine hes over in your country running an investigation just watch it was a press conference im afraid i cant comment on the name rain god at this present time and we are calling h im an example of a spontaneous para ­‐ causal meteorological phenomenon can you tell us what that means im not altogether sure lets be straight here if we find something we cant understand we like to call it something you cant understand or ind eed pronounce i mean if we just let you go around calling him a rain god then that suggests that you know something we dont and im afraid we couldnt have that no first we have to call it something which says its ours not yours then we set abou t finding some way of proving its not what you said it is but something we say it is and if it turns out that youre right youll still be wrong because we will simply call him a er supernormal ʹ not paranormal or supernatural because you th ink you know what those mean now no a supernormal incremental precipitation inducer well probably want to shove a quasi in there somewhere to protect ourselves rain god huh never heard such nonsense in my life admittedly you wouldnt catch me going on holiday with him thanks thatll be all for now other than to say hi to wonko if hes watching chapter on the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the plane who was looking at them rather oddly they talked quietly to themselves i still have to know said fenchurch and i strongly feel that you know something that youre not telling me arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper do you have a pencil he said she dug around and found one what are you doi ng sweetheart she said after he had spent twenty minutes frowning chewing the pencil scribbling on the paper crossing things out scribbling again chewing the pencil again and grunting irritably to himself trying to remember an address someone o nce gave me your life would be an awful lot simpler she said if you bought yourself an address book finally he passed the paper to her you look after it he said she looked at it among all the scratchings and crossings out were the words quentulus quazgar mountains sevorbeupstry planet of preliumtarn sun ­‐zarss galactic sector qq active j gamma and whats there apparently said arthur its gods fi nal message to his creation that sounds a bit more like it said fenchurch how do we get there you really yes said fenchurch firmly i really want to know arthur looked out of the scratchy little perspex window at the open sky outsi de excuse me said the woman who had been looking at them rather oddly suddenly i hope you dont think im rude i get so bored on these long flights its nice to talk to somebody my names enid kapelsen im from boston tell me do you fly a lot chapter they went to arthurs house in the west country shoved a couple of towels and stuff in a bag and then sat down to do what every galactic hitch hiker ends up spending most of his time doing they waited for a flying saucer to come by friend of mine did this for fifteen years said arthur one night as they sat forlornly watching the sky who was that called ford prefect he caught himself doing something he had never really expected to do again he wondered where ford prefect was by an extraordinary coincidence the following day there were two reports in the paper one concerning the most astonishing incidents with a flying saucer and the other about a series of unseemly riots i n pubs ford prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and complaining that arthur never answered the phone in fact he looked extremely ill not merely as if hed been pulled through a hedge backwards but as if the hedge was being simultan eously pulled backwards through a combine harvester he staggered into arthurs sitting room waving aside all offers of support which was an error because the effort caused him to lose his balance altogether and arthur had eventually to drag him to the sofa thank you said ford thank you very much have you he said and fell asleep for three hours the faintest idea he continued suddenly when he revived how hard it is to tap into the british phone system from the pleiades i can see t hat you havent so ill tell you he said over the very large mug of black coffee that you are about to make me he followed arthur wobbily into the kitchen stupid operators keep asking you where youre calling from and you try and tell them letchworth and they say you couldnt be if youre coming in on that circuit what are you doing making you some black coffee oh ford seemed oddly disappointed he looked about the place forlornly whats this he said rice crispies and this paprika i see said ford solemnly and put the two items back down one on top of the other but that didnt seem to balance properly so he put the other on top of the one and that seemed to work a little space ­‐lagged he said what was i saying about not phoning from letchworth i wasnt i explained this to the lady bugger letchworth i said if thats your attitude i am in fact calling f rom a sales scoutship of the sirius cybernetics corporation currently on the sub ­‐light ­‐speed leg of a journey between the stars known on your world though not necessarily to you dear lady ʹ i said dear lady explained ford prefect because i didn t want her to be offended by my implication that she was an ignorant cretin tactful said arthur dent exactly said ford tactful he frowned space ­‐lag he said is very bad for sub ­‐clauses youll have to assist me again he continued by reminding me what i was talking about between the stars said arthur known on your world though not necessarily to you dear lady as pleiades epsilon and pleiades zeta concluded ford triumphantly this conversation lark is quit e gas isnt it have some coffee thank you no and the reason i said why i am bothering you with it rather than just dialling direct as i could because we have some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in the pleiades i can tell you is that the penny pinching son of a starbeast piloting this son of a starbeast spaceship insists that i call collect can you believe that and could she i dont know she had hung up said ford by this time so what do you suppo se he asked fiercely i did next ive no idea ford said arthur pity said ford i was hoping you could remind me i really hate those guys you know they really are the creeps of the cosmos buzzing around the celestial infinite with their j unky little machines that never work properly or when they do perform functions that no sane man would require of them and he added savagely go beep to tell you when theyve done it this was perfectly true and a very respectable view widely held by right thinking people who are largely recognizable as being right thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million nine hundred and seventy ­‐five thousand five hundred and nine pages says of the sirius cybernetics corporation product that it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all in other words ʹ and this is the rock solid principle on which the whole of the corporations galaxy ­‐wide success is founded ʹ their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws and this guy ranted ford was on a drive to sell more of them his five ­‐year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds and sell advanced music substitute systems to their restaurants elevators and wine bars or if they didnt have restaurant s elevators and wine bars yet to artificially accelerate their civilization growth until they bloody well did have wheres that coffee i threw it away make some more i have now remembered what i did next i saved civilization as we know it i k new it was something like that he stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room where he seemed to carry on talking to himself tripping over the furniture and making beep beep noises a couple of minutes later wearing his very placid face arthur followed him ford looked stunned where have you been he demanded making some coffee said arthur still wearing his very placid face he had long ago realized that the only way of b eing in fords company successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces and wear them at all times you missed the best bit raged ford you missed the bit where i jumped the guy now he said i shall have to jump him all over him he hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it it was better he said sullenly last time and waved vaguely in the direction of another broken chair which he had already got trussed up on the dining table i see said arthur casting a placid eye over the trussed up wreckage and er what are all the ice cubes for what screamed ford what you missed that bit too thats the suspended animation facility i put the guy in the suspended animation facility well i had to didnt i so i t would seem said arthur in his placid voice dont touch that yelled ford arthur who was about to replace the phone which was for some mysterious reason lying on the table off the hook paused placidly ok said ford calming down list en to it arthur put the phone to his ear its the speaking clock he said beep beep beep said ford is exactly what is being heard all over that guys ship while he sleeps in the ice going slowly round a little ­‐known moon of sesefras magn a the london speaking clock i see said arthur again and decided that now was the time to ask the big one why he said placidly with a bit of luck said ford the phone bill will bankrupt the buggers he threw himself sweating on to th e sofa anyway he said dramatic arrival dont you think chapter the flying saucer in which ford prefect had stowed away had stunned the world finally there was no doubt no possibility of mistake no hallucinations no mysterious cia agents found floating in reservoirs this time it was real it was definite it was quite definitely definite it had come down with a wonderful disregard for any thing beneath it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate in the world including much of harrods the thing was massive nearly a mile across some said dull silver in colour pitted scorched and disfigured with the scars of u nnumbered vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns unknown to man a hatchway opened crashed down through the harrods food halls demolished harvey nicholls and with a final grinding scream of tortured architecture toppled t he sheraton park tower after a long heart ­‐stopping moment of internal crashes and grumbles of rending machinery there marched from it down the ramp an immense silver robot a hundred feet tall it held up a hand i come in peace it said adding after a long moment of further grinding take me to your lizard ford prefect of course had an explanation for this as he sat with arthur and watched the non ­‐stop frenetic news reports on the television none of whi ch had anything to say other than to record that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other number of people and then say it again because the robot was doing nothing m ore than standing there swaying very slightly and emitting short incomprehensible error messages it comes from a very ancient democracy you see you mean it comes from a world of lizards no said ford who by this time was a little more ra tional and coherent than he had been having finally had the coffee forced down him nothing so simple nothing anything like so straightforward on its world the people are people the leaders are lizards the people hate the lizards and the lizards rol e the people odd said arthur i thought you said it was a democracy i did said ford it is so said arthur hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont people get rid of the lizards it honestly doesnt occur to them s aid ford theyve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want you mean they actually vote for the lizards oh yes said ford with a shrug of course but said arthur going for the big one again why because if they didnt vote for a lizard said ford the wrong lizard might get in got any gin what i said said ford with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice have you got any gin ill look tell me about the lizards ford shrugged again some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them he said theyre completely wrong of course completely and utterly wrong but someones go t to say it but thats terrible said arthur listen bud said ford if i had one altairan dollar for every time i heard one bit of the universe look at another bit of the universe and say thats terrible i wouldnt be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin but i havent and i am anyway what are you looking so placid and moon ­‐eyed for are you in love arthur said yes he was and said it placidly with someone who knows where the gin bottle is do i get to meet her he did because fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of newspapers shed been into the village to buy she stopped in astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from betelgeuse on the sofa wheres the gin said ford to fenchurch and to arthur what happened to trillian by the way er this is fenchurch said arthur awkwardly there was nothing with trillian you must have seen her last oh yeah said ford she went off with zaphod somewhere they had some kids or something at least he added i think thats what they were zapho ds calmed down a lot you know really said arthur clustering hurriedly round fenchurch to relieve her of the shopping yeah said ford at least one of his heads is now saner than an emu on acid arthur who is this said fenchurch ford p refect said arthur i may have mentioned him in passing chapter for a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in stunned amazement straddling the remains of knightsbridge swaying slightly and trying to work out a number of things government deputations came to see it ranting journalists by the truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they thought of it flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it ʹ but no lizards appeared it scanned th e horizon slowly at night it was at its most spectacular floodlit by the teams of television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did nothing it thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion it would have to send out its service robots it should have thought of that before but it was having a number of problems the tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal they roamed the surround ing terrain frantically attacking some things and defending others one of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards but it instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little in the area survived a turning point came when a cr ack team of flying screechers discovered the zoo in regents park and most particularly the reptile house learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the petshop the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot who tried to conduct high ­‐ level talks with them eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full frank and wide ­‐ranging exchange of views the high level talks had broken down the lizards had been retired and that it the robot would take a short holiday somewhere and for some reason selected bournemouth ford prefect watching it on tv nodded laughed and had another beer immediate preparations were made for its departure the flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things with light throughout that day and al l through the night time and in the morning stunningly a giant mobile gantry started to roll westwards on several roads simultaneously with the robot standing on it supported within the gantry westward it crawled like a strange carnival buzzed aroun d by its servants and helicopters and news coaches scything through the land until at last it came to bournemouth where the robot slowly freed itself from it transport systems embraces and went and lay for ten days on the beach it was of course by f ar the most exciting thing that had ever happened to bournemouth crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out and guarded as the robots recreation area and tried to see what it was doing it was doing nothing it was lying on the bea ch it was lying a little awkwardly on its face it was a journalist from a local paper who late one night managed to do what no one else in the world had so far managed which was to strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service robots guarding the perimeter it was an extraordinary breakthrough i think theres a story in it confided the journalist over a cigarette shared through the steel link fence but it needs a good local angle ive got a little list of questions here he went on rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket perhaps you could get him it whatever you call him to run through them quickly the little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it cold do and screeched off a reply was never forthc oming curiously however the questions on the piece of paper more or less exactly matched the questions that were going through the massive battle ­‐scarred industrial quality circuits of the robots mind they were these how do you feel about being a robot how does it feel to be from outer space and how do you like bournemouth early the following day things started to be packed up and within a few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave for good the point is said f enchurch to ford can you get us on board ford looked wildly at his watch i have some serious unfinished business to attend to he exclaimed chapter crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft which wasnt very the immediate perimeter was fenced off and patrolled by the tiny flying service robots staked out around that was the army who had been completely unable to breach that inner perimeter but were damned if anybody was going to breach them they in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police though whether they were there to protect the public from the army or the army from the public or to guarantee the giant ships diplo matic immunity and prevent it getting parking tickets was entirely unclear and the subject of much debate the inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled the army stirred uncomfortably uncertain of how to react to the fact that the reason for their being there seemed as if it was simply going to get up and go the giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime and now it was five oclock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it much had been heard ʹ more grindings and ru mblings from deep within the craft the music of a million hideous malfunctions but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed this wonderful extraordinary thing had come into their l ives an now it was simply going to go without them two people were particularly aware of this sensation arthur and fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously unable to find ford prefect in it anywhere or any sign that he had the slightest intention of bei ng there how reliable is he asked fenchurch in a sinking voice how reliable said arthur he gave a hollow laugh how shallow is the ocean he said how cold is the sun the last parts of the robots gantry transport were being carried on board and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow them the soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully orders were barked back and forth hurried conferences were held but nothing of course could be done about any of it hopelessly and with no clear plan now arthur and fenchurch pushed forward through the crowd but since the whole crowd was also try ing to push forward through the crowd this got them nowhere and within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship every last link of the fence was aboard a couple of flying fret saws and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site and then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves a few seconds passed the sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity and slowly heavily the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of the harrods food halls the sound that accompanied it was the sound of thousands of tense excited people being completely ignored hold it a megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the edge of the milling crowd there has been barked the megaphone a major scientific break ­‐in through breakthrough it corrected itself the door flew open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse leapt out wearing a white coat hold it he shouted again and this time brandished a short squad black rod with lights on it the lights winked briefly the ramp paused in its ascent and then in obedience to the signals from the thumb which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming while the other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals slowly ground its way downwards again ford prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and started bawling at the crowd through it make way he shouted make way please this is a major scientific breakthrough you and you get the equipment from the taxi completely at random he pointed at arthur and fenchurch who wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently round the taxi all right i wan t you to clear a passage please for some important pieces of scientific equipment boomed ford just everybody keep calm its all under control theres nothing to see it is merely a major scientific breakthrough keep calm now important scientific equipment clear the way hungry for new excitement delighted at this sudden reprieve from disappointment the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to open up arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes of important scie ntific equipment in the back of the taxi hang your coat over them he muttered to fenchurch as he heaved them out to her hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat it clattered to the ground and together they loaded the boxes into it clear a path please shouted ford again everythings under proper scientific control he said youd pay said the taxi ­‐driver to arthur who dug out some notes and paid him there was the distant sound of police sirens move along there shouted ford and no one will get hurt the crowd surged and closed behind them again as frantically they pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through the rubble towards the ramp its all right ford continued to bellow theres nothing to see its all over none of this is actually happening clear the way please boomed a police megaphone from the back of the crowd theres been a break ­‐in clear the way breakthrough yelled ford in competition a scientific breakthrough this is the police clear the way scientific equipment clear the way police let us through walkmen yelled ford and pulled half a dozen miniature tape players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd the resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp and to haul it up on to the lip of it hold tight muttered ford and released a button on his electronic thumb beneath them the huge ramp juddered and began slowly to heave its way upwards ok kids he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath them and they started t o lurch their way along the tilting ramp into the bowels of the ship looks like were on our way chapter arthur dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire being careful not to wake fenchurch who was still managing to sleep fitfully he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway which they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily they were claustrophobic and ill ­‐lit the lighting cir cuits buzzed annoyingly this wasnt it though he paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech occasionally clanging against the walls like a confused bee as it did so that wasnt it either he clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he walked towards the other he came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate of toughened b ut still badly scratched perspex would you turn it down please he said to ford prefect who was crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video equipment hed taken from a shop window in tottenham court road having first hurled a sma ll brick through it and also a nasty heap of empty beer cans shhhh hissed ford and peered with manic concentration at the screen he was watching the magnificent seven just a bit said arthur no shouted ford were just getting to the good bit listen i finally got it all sorted out voltage levels line conversion everything and this is the good bit with a sigh and a headache arthur sat down beside him and watched the good bit he listened to fords whoops and yells and yeehays a s placidly as he could ford he said eventually when it was all over and ford was hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of casablanca how come if this is the big one said ford this is the one i came back for do you realize i never saw it all through always i missed the end i saw half of it again the night before the vogons came when they blew the place up i thought id never get to see it hey what happened with all that anyway just life said arthur and plucked a beer from a six ­‐pack oh that again said ford i thought it might be something like that i prefer this stuff he said as ricks bar flickered on to the screen how come if what what you started to sa y how come if how come if youre so rude about the earth that you oh never mind lets just watch the movie exactly said ford chapter there remains little still to tell beyond what used to be known as the limitless lightfiel ds of flanux until the grey binding fiefdoms of saxaquine were discovered lying behind them lie the grey binding fiefdoms of saxaquine within the grey binding fiefdoms of saxaquine lies the star named zarss around which orbits the planet preliumtarn in which is the land of sevorbeupstry and it was to the land of sevorbeupstry that arthur and fenchurch came at last a little tired by the journey and in the land of sevorbeupstry they came to the great red plain of rars which was bounded on the south s ide by the quentulus quazgar mountains on the further side of which according to the dying words of prak they would find in thirty ­‐foot­‐high letters of fire gods final message to his creation according to prak if arthurs memory saved him right the place was guarded by the lajestic vantrashell of lob and so after a manner it proved to be he was a little man in a strange hat and he sold them a ticket keep to the left please he said keep to the left and hurried on past them on a little s cooter they realized they were not the first to pass that way for the path that led around the left of the great plain was well ­‐worn and dotted with booths at one they bought a box of fudge which had been baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain wh ich was heated by the fire of the letters that formed gods final message to his creation at another they bought some postcards the letters had been blurred with an airbrush so as not to spoil the big surprise it said on the reverse do you know wh at the message is they asked the wizened little lady in the booth oh yes she piped cheerily oh yes she waved them on every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers and sanitary facilities but the going was tough and the high sun baked down on the great red plain and the great red plain rippled in the heat is it possible asked arthur at one of the larger booths to rent one of those little scooters like the one lajestic ventrawhatsit had the scooters said the little lady who was serving at an ice cream bar are not for the devout oh well thats easy then said fenchurch were not particularly devout were just interested then you must turn back now said the little lady severely and when they d emurred sold them a couple of final message sunhats and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each other on the great red plain of rars they drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then trudged out into the sun again were running out of border cream said fenchurch after a few more miles we can go to the next booth or we can return to the previous one which is nearer but means we have to retrace our steps again they stared ahead at the distant black speck win king in the heat haze they looked behind themselves they elected to go on they then discovered that they were not only not the first ones to make this journey but that they were not the only ones making it now some way ahead of them an awkward low s hape was heaving itself wretchedly along the ground stumbling painfully slowly half ­‐limping half­‐crawling it was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the creature up and could see that it was made of worn scarred and twisted metal it groaned at them as they approached it collapsing in the hot dry dust so much time it groaned oh so much time and pain as well so much of that and so much time to suffer it in too one or the other on its own i could probably manage its the two together that really get me down oh hello you again marvin said arthur sharply crouching down beside it is that you you were always one groaned the aged husk of the robot for the super ­‐intelligent question werent you what is it whispered fenchurch in alarm crouching behind arthur and grasping on to his arm hes sort of an old friend said arthur i friend croaked the robot pathetically the word died away in a kind of crackle and flakes of rust fell out of its mo uth youll have to excuse me while i try and remember what the word means my memory banks are not what they were you know and any word which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down into auxiliary memory back ­‐up ah here it co mes the robots battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought hmm he said what a curious concept he thought a little longer no he said at last dont think i ever came across one of those sorry cant help you there he scraped a kn ee along pathetically in the dust an then tried to twist himself up on his misshapen elbows is there any last service you would like me to perform for you perhaps he asked in a kind of hollow rattle a piece of paper that perhaps you would like me t o pick up for you or maybe you would like me he continued to open a door his head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to scan the distant horizon dont seem to be any doors around at present he said but im sure that if we waited long enough someone would build one and then he said slowly twisting his head around to see arthur again i could open it for you im quite used to waiting you know arthur hissed fenchurch in his ear sharply you never told me of this what have you done to this poor creature nothing insisted arthur sadly hes always like this ha snapped marvin ha he repeated what do you know of always you say always to me who because of the silly little errands your organic li feforms keep on sending me through time on am now thirty ­‐seven times older than the universe itself pick your words with a little more care he coughed and tact he rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed leave me he said go on ahea d leave me to struggle painfully on my way my time at last has nearly come my race is nearly run i fully expect he said feebly waving them on with a broken finger to come in last it would be fitting here i am brain the size between them th ey picked him up despite his feeble protests and insults the metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers but he weighed surprisingly little and hung limply between their arms they carried him with them along the path that ran along the left of the great red plain of rars toward the encircling mountains of quentulus quazgar arthur attempted to explain to fenchurch but was too often interrupted by marvins dolorous cybernetic ravings they tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of the booths but marvin would have none of it im all spare parts he droned let me be he groaned every part of me he moaned has been replaced at least fifty times except he seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a moment his head bobbed between them with the effort of memory do you remember the first time you ever met me he said at last to arthur i had been given the intellect ­‐stretching task of taking you up to the bridge i mentioned to you that i had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side that i had asked for them to be replaced but they never were he lef t a longish pause before he continued they carried him on between them under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to move let alone set see if you can guess said marvin when he judged that the pause had become embarrassing enough which parts o f me were never replaced go on see if you can guess ouch he added ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch at last they reached the last of the little booths set down marvin between them and rested in the shade fenchurch bought some cufflinks for russell cufflinks that had set in them little polished pebbles which had been picked up from the quentulus quazgar mountains directly underneath the letters of fire in which was written gods final message to his creation arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the counter little meditations on the meaning of the message ready he said to fenchurch who nodded they heaved up marvin between them they rounded the foot of the quentulus quazgar mountains and there was the message wri tten in blazing letters along the crest of the mountain there was a little observation vantage point with a rail built along the top of a large rock facing it from which you could get a good view it had a little pay ­‐telescope for looking at the letters in detail but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with the divine brilliance of the heavens and would if seen through a telescope have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve they gazed at gods final message in wonderment and wer e slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace and of final and complete understanding fenchurch sighed yes she said that was it they had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they became aware that marvin hanging between their shoulders was in difficulties the robot could no longer lift his head had not read the message they lifted his head but he complained that his vision circuits had almost gone they found a coin and helped him to the telescope he complained and insulted them but they helped him look at each individual letter in turn the first letter was a w the second an e then there was a gap an a followed then a p an o and an l marvin paused for a rest after a few moments they resumed an d let him see the o the g the i the s and the e the next two words were for and the the last one was a long one and marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it it started with an i then n then a c next came an o an d an n followed by a v an e another n and an i after a final pause marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch he read the e the n the c and at last the final e and staggered back into their arms i think he murmured at last from deep within his corroding rattling thorax i feel good about it the lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever luckily there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from guys with green wings epilogue one of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who couldnt keep his mind on the job in hand brilliant certainly one of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other generation including a number he had designed himself without a doubt the problem was that he was far too interested in things which he shouldnt be interested in at least as people would tell him not now he was also partly because of this of a rather irritable disposition so when his world was th reatened by terrible invaders from a distant star who were still a fair way off but travelling fast he blart versenwald iii his name was blart versenwald iii which is not strictly relevant but quite interesting because ʹ never mind that was his name and we can talk about why its interesting later was sent into guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with instructions to design a breed of fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish the feared invaders do it quickly and they told him con centrate so he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and designed and designed and designed but inevitably got a little distracted by things and by the time the invaders were practically in orbit round them had come up with a remarkable new breed of super ­‐fly that could unaided figure out how to fly through the open half of a half ­‐open window and also an off ­‐switch for children celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to be shortlived because disaster was imminent as t he alien ships were landing but astoundingly the fearsome invaders who like most warlike races were only on the rampage because they couldnt cope with things at home were stunned by versenwalds extraordinary breakthroughs joined in the celebrations and were instantly prevailed upon to sign a wide ­‐ranging series of trading agreements and set up a programme of cultural exchanges and in an astonishing reversal of normal practice in the conduct of such matters everybody concerned lived happily ever af ter there was a point to this story but it has temporarily escaped the chroniclers mind douglas adams young zaphod plays it safe a large flying craft moved swiftly across the surface of an astoundingly beautiful sea from mid ­‐morning onward i t plied back and forth in great widening arcs and at last attracted the attention of the local islanders a peaceful sea ­‐food ­‐loving people who gathered on the beach and squinted up into the blinding sun trying to see what was there any sophisticated knowledgeable person who had knocked about seen a few things would probably have remarked on how much the craft looked like a filing cabinet ʹ a large and recently burgled filing cabinet lying on its back with its drawers in the air and flying the isl anders whose experience was of a different kind were instead struck by how little it looked like a lobster they chattered excitedly about its total lack of claws its stiff unbending back and the fact that it seemed to experience the greatest difficul ty staying on the ground this last feature seemed particularly funny to them they jumped up and down on the spot a lot to demonstrate to the stupid thing that they themselves found staying on the ground the easiest thing in the world but soon this ente rtainment began to pall for them after all since it was perfectly clear to them that the thing was not a lobster and since their world was blessed with an abundance of things that were lobsters a good half dozen of which were now marching succulently up the beach toward them they saw no reason to waste any more time on the thing but decided instead to adjourn immediately for a late lobster lunch at that exact moment the craft stopped suddenly in mid ­‐air then upended itself and plunged headlong into the ocean with a great crash of spray which sent them shouting into the trees when they reemerged nervously a few minutes later all they were able to see was a smoothly scarred circle of water and a few gulping bubbles thats odd they said to each other between mouthfuls of the best lobster to be had anywhere in the western galaxy thats the second time thats happened in a year the craft which wasnt a lobster dived direct to a depth of two hundred feet and hung there in the heavy blueness while vast masses of water swayed about it high above where the water was magically clear a brilliant formation of fish flashed away below where the light had difficulty reaching the color of the water sank to a dark and savage here at two hundred feet the sun streamed feebly a large silk ­‐ skinned sea ­‐mammal rolled idly by inspecting the craft with a kind of half interest as if it had half expected to find something of this kind around about here and then it slid o n up and away toward the rippling light the craft waited for a minute or two taking readings and then descended another hundred feet at this depth it was becoming seriously dark after a moment or two the internal lights of the craft shut down an in the second or so that passed before the main external beams suddenly stabbed out the only visible light came from a small hazily illuminated pink sign which read the beeblebrox salvage and really wild stuff corporation the huge beams switched downward catching a vast shoal of silver fish which swiveled away in silent panic in the dim control room which extended in a broad bow from the crafts blunt prow four heads were gathered around a computer display that was analyzing the very very faint and intermittent signals that emanated from deep on the sea bed thats it said the owner of one of the heads finally can we be quite sure said the owner of another of the heads one hundred percent positive replied the owner of the first head youre one hundred percent positive that the ship which is crashed on the bottom of this ocean is the ship which you said you were one hundred percent positive could one hundred percent positively never crash said the owner of the two remaining heads hey he put up two of his hands im only asking the two officials from the safety and civil reassurance administration responded to this with a very cold stare but the man with the odd or rather the even number of heads missed it he flung himself back on the pilot couch opened a couple of beers ʹ one for himself and the other also for himself ʹ stuck his feet on the console and said hey baby through the ultra ­‐glass at a passing fish mr beeblebrox began the shorter and less reassuring of the two officials in a low voice yup said zaphod rapping a suddenly empty can down on some of the more sensitive instruments you ready to dive lets go mr beeblebrox let us make on e thing perfectly clear yeah lets said zaphod how about this for a start why dont you just tell me whats really on this ship we have told you said the official by ­‐products zaphod exchanged weary glances with himself by­‐products he said by ­‐products of what processes said the official what processes processes that are perfectly safe santa zarquana voostra exclaimed both of zaphods heads in chorus so safe that you have to build a zarking fortress ship to ta ke the byproducts to the nearest black hole and tip them in only it doesnt get there because the pilot takes a detour ʹ is this right ʹ to pick up some lobster ok so the guy is cool but i mean own up this is barking time this is major lunch this is stool approaching critical mass this is this is total vocabulary failure shut up his right head yelled at his left were flanging he got a good calming grip on the remaining beer can listen guys he resumed after a moments p eace and contemplation the two officials had said nothing conversation at this level was not something to which they felt they could aspire i just want to know insisted zaphod what youre getting me into here he stabbed a finger at the intermittent readings trickling over the computer screen they meant nothing to him but he didnt like the look of them at all they were all squiggly with lots of long numbers and things its breaking up is that it he shou ted its got a hold full of epsilonic radiating aorist rods or something thatll fry this whole space sector for zillions of years back and its breaking up is that the story is that what were going down to find am i going to come out of that wreck w ith even more heads it cannot possibly be a wreck mr beeblebrox insisted the official the ship is guaranteed to be perfectly safe it cannot possibly break up then why are you so keen to go and look at it we like to look at things that ar e perfectly safe freeeooow mr beeblebrox said the official patiently may i remind you that you have a job to do yeah well maybe i dont feel so keen on doing it all of a sudden what do you think i am completely without any moral whats its what are they called those moral things scruples scruples thank you whatsoever well the two officials waited calmly they coughed slightly to help pass the time zaphod sighed a what is the world coming to sort of sigh to absolve him self from all blame and swung himself around in his seat ship he called yup said the ship do what i do the ship thought about this for a few milliseconds and then after double checking all the seals on its heavy duty bulkheads it began slowly inexorably in the hazy blaze of its lights to sink to the lowest depths five hundred feet a thousand two thousand here at a pressure of nearly seventy atmospheres in the chilling depths where no light reaches nature keeps its most hea ted imaginings two foo long nightmares loomed wildly into the bleaching light yawned and vanished back into the blackness two and a half thousand feet at the dim edges of the ships lights guilty secrets flitted by with their eyes on stalks grad ually the topography of the distantly approaching ocean bed resolved with greater and greater clarity on the computer displays until as last a shape could be made out that was separate and distinct from its surroundings it was like a huge lopsided cylindr ical fortress that widened sharply halfway along its length to accommodate the heavy ultraplating with which the crucial storage holds were clad and which were supposed by its builders to have made this the most secure and impregnable spaceship ever built before launch the material structure of this section had been battered rammed blasted and subjected to every assault its builders knew it could withstand in order to demonstrate that it could withstand them the tense silence in the cockpit tightened perceptibly as it became dear that it was this section that had broken rather neatly in two in fact its perfectly safe said one of the officials its built so that even if the ship does break up the storage holds cannot possibly be breached three thousand eight hundred and twenty ­‐five feet four hi ­‐presh ­‐a smart suits moved slowly out of the open hatchway of the salvage craft and waded through the barrage of its lights toward the monstrous shape that loomed darkly out of the sea night they moved with a sort of clumsy grace near weightlessness though weighed on by a world of water with his right ­‐hand head zaphod peered up into the black immensities above him and for a moment his mind sang with a silent roar of horror he glanced to his le ft and was relieved to see that his other head was busy watching the brockian ultra ­‐cricket broadcasts on the helmet vid without concern slightly behind him to his left walked the two officials from the safety and civil reassurance administration slightl y in front of him to his right walked the empty suit carrying their implements and testing the way for them they passed the huge rift in the broken backed starship billion year bunker and played their flashlights up into it mangled machinery loomed be tween torn and twisted bulkheads two feet thick a family of large transparent eels lived in there now and seemed to like it the empty suit preceded them along the length of the ships gigantic murky hull trying the airlocks the third one it tested ground open uneasily they crowded inside it and waited for several long minutes while the pump mechanisms dealt with the hideous pressure that the ocean exerted and slowly replaced it with an equally hideous pressure of air and inert gases at last the inner door slid open and they were admitted to a dark outer holding area of the starship billion year bunker several more high se curity titan ­‐o­‐hold doors had to be passed through each of which the officials opened with a selection of quark keys soon they were so deep within the heavy security fields that the ultracricket broadcasts were beginning to fade and zaphod had to switch to one of the rock video stations since there was nowhere that they were not able to reach a final doorway slid open and they emerged into a large sepulchral space zaphod played his flashlight against the opposite wall and it fell full on a wild ­‐eyed screaming face zaphod screamed a diminished fifth himself dropped his light and sat heavily on the floor or rather on a body which had been lying there undisturbed for around six months and which reacted to being sat on by exploding with great violenc e zaphod wondered what to do about all this and after a brief but hectic internal debate decided that passing out would be the very thing he came to a few minutes later and pretended not to know who he was where he was or how he had got there but was nor able to convince anybody he then pretended that his memory suddenly retuned with a rush and that the shock caused him to pass out again but he was helped unwillingly to his feet by the empty suit ʹ which he was beginning to take a serious dislike to ʹ and forced to come to terms with his surroundings they were dimly and fitfully lit and unpleasant in a number of respects the most obvious of which was the colorful arrangement of parts of the ships late lamented navigation officer over the floor walls and ceiling and especially over the lower half of his zaphods suit the effect of this was so astoundingly nasty that we shall not be referring to it again at any point in this narrative ʹ other than to record briefly the fact that it caused zapho d to throw up inside his suit which he therefore removed and swapped after suitable headgear modifications with the empty one unfortunately the stench of the fetid air in the ship followed by the sight of his own suit walking around casually draped in rotting intestines was enough to make him throw up in the other suit as well which was a problem that he and the suit would simply have to live with there all done no more nastiness at least no more of that particular nastiness the owner of the screaming face had calmed down very slightly now and was babbling away incoherently in a large tank of yellow liquid ­‐ emergency suspension tank it was crazy he babbled crazy i told him we could always try the lobster on the way back but he was cr azy obsessed do you ever get like that about lobster because i dont seems to me its all rubbery and fiddly to eat and not that much taste well i mean is there i infinitely prefer scallops and said so oh zarquon i said so zaphod stared at thi s extraordinary apparition flailing in its tank the man was attached to all kinds of life ­‐support tubes and his voice was bubbling out of speakers that echoed insanely around the ship returning as haunting echoes from deep and distant corridors that was where i went wrong the madman yelled i actually said that i preferred scallops and he said it was because i hadnt had real lobster like they did where his ancestors came from which was here and hed prove it he said it was no problem he said the lobster here was worth a whole journey let alone the small diversion it would take to get here and he swore he could handle the ship in the atmosphere but it was madness madness he screamed and paused with his eyes rolling as if the word had ru ng some kind of bell in his mind the ship went right out of control i couldnt believe what we were doing and just to prove a point about lobster which is really so overrated as a food im sorry to go on about lobsters so much ill try and stop in a m inute but theyve been on my mind so much for the months ive been in this tank can you imagine what its like to be stuck in a ship with the same guys for months eating junk food when all one guy will talk about is lobster and then spend six months floa ting by yourself in a tank thinking about it i promise i will try and shut up about the lobsters i really will lobsters lobsters lobsters ʹ enough i think im the only survivor im the only one who managed to get to an emergency tank before we went down i sent out the mayday and then we hit its a disaster isnt it a total disaster and all because the guy liked lobsters how much sense am i making its really hard for me to tell he gazed at them beseechingly and his mind seemed to sway slow ly back down to earth like a falling leaf he blinked and looked at them oddly like a monkey peering at a strange fish he scrabbled curiously with his wrinkled up fingers at the glass side of the tank tiny thick yellow bubbles loosed themselves from his mouth and nose caught briefly in his swab of hair and strayed on upward oh zarquon oh heavens he mumbled pathetically to himself ive been found ive been rescued well said one of the officials brisklyyouve been found at least he strode over to the main computer bank in the middle of the chamber and started checking quickly through the ships main monitor circuits for damage reports the aorist rod chambers are intact he said holy dingos dos snarled zaphod there are aor ist rods on board aorist rods were devices used in a now happily abandoned form of energy production when the hunt for new sources of energy had at one point got particularly frantic one bright young chap suddenly spotted that one place which had n ever used up all its available energy ʹ the past and with the sudden rush of blood to the head that such insights tend to induce he invented a way of mining it that very same night and within a year huge tracts of the past were being drained of all thei r energy and simply wasting away those who claimed that the past should be left unspoiled were accused of indulging in an extremely expensive form of sentimentality the past provided a very cheap plentiful and clean source of energy there could always b e a few natural past reserves set up if anyone wanted to pay for their upkeep and as for the claim that draining the past impoverished the present well maybe it did slightly but the effects were immeasurable and you really had to keep a sense of propo rtion it was only when it was realized that the present really was being impoverished and that the reason for it was that those selfish plundering wastrel bastards up in the future were doing exactly the same thing that everyone realized that every sin gle aorist rod and the terrible secret of how they were made would have to be utterly and forever destroyed they claimed it was for the sake of their grandparents and grandchildren but it was of course for the sake of their grandparents grandchildren and their grandchildrens grandparents the official from the safety and civil reassurance administration gave a dismissive shrug theyre perfectly safe he said he glanced up at zaphod and suddenly said with uncharacteristic franknesstheres wors e than that on board at least he added tapping at one of the computer screens i hope its on board the other official rounded on him sharply what the hell do you think youre saying he snapped the first shrugged again he said it doesnt matter he can say what he likes no one would believe him its why we chose to use him rather than do anything official isnt it the more wild the story he tells the more itll sound like hes some hippy adventurer making it up he can even say that we said this and itll make him sound like a paranoid he smile pleasantly at zaphod who was seething in his nasty suit you may accompany us he told him if you wish you see said the official ex amining the ultra ­‐titanium outer seals of the aorist rod hold perfectly secure perfectly safe he said the same thing as they passed holds containing chemical weapons so powerful that a teaspoonful could fatally infect an entire planet he said the s ame thing as they passed holds containing zeta ­‐activq compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could blow up a whole planet he said the same thing as they passed holds containing theta ­‐active compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could irradiate a wh ole planet im glad im not a planet muttered zaphod youd have nothing to fear assured the official from the safety and civil reassurance administration planets are very safe provided he added ʹ and paused they were approaching the hold nearest to the point where the back of the starship billion year bunker was broken the corridor here was twisted and deformed and the floor was damp and sticky in patches ho hum he saidho very much hum whats in this hold demanded zaphod by­‐products said the official clamming up again by­‐products insisted zaphod quietly of what neither official answered instead they examined the hold door very carefully and saw that its seals were twisted apart by the forces that had defor med the whole corridor one of them touched the door lightly it swung open to his touch there was darkness inside with just a couple of dim yellow lights deep within it of what hissed zaphod the leading official turned to the other theres an escape capsule he said that the crew were to use to abandon ship before jettisoning it into the black hole he said i think it would be good to know that its still there the other official nodded and left without a word the first official quietly beckoned zaphod in the large dim yellow lights glowed about twenty feet from them the reason he said quietly why everything else in this ship is i maintain safe is that no one is really crazy enough to use them no one at least no one that crazy would ever get near them anyone that mad or dangerous rings very deep alarm bells people may be stupid but theyre not that stupid by­‐products hissed zaphod again he had to hiss in order that his voice shouldnt be he ard to tremble of what er designer people what the sirius cybernetics corporation was awarded a huge research grant to design and produce synthetic personalities to order the results were uniformly disastrous all the people and persona lities turned out to be amalgams of characteristics that simply could not co ­‐ exist in naturally occurring life forms most of them were just poor pathetic misfits but some were deeply deeply dangerous dangerous because they didnt ring alarm bells in o ther people they could walk through situations the way that ghosts walk through walls because no one spotted the danger the most dangerous of all were three identical ones ʹ they were put in this hold to be blasted with this ship right out of this universe they are not evil in fact they are rather simple and charming but they are the most dangerous creatures that ever lived because there is nothing they will not do if allowed and nothing they will not be allowed to do zaphod looked at the dim yellow lights the two dim yellow lights as his eyes became accustomed to the light he saw that the two lights framed a third space where something was broken wet sticky patches gleamed dully on the floor zaphod and the official walked cautiously t oward the lights at that moment four words came crashing into the helmet headsets from the other official the capsule is gone he said tersely trace it snapped zaphods companion find exactly where it has gone we must know where it has gone zaphod slid aside a large ground ­‐glass door beyond it lay a tank full of thick yellow liquid and floating in it was a man a kindly looking man wit h lots of pleasant laugh lines around his face he seemed to be floating quite contentedly and smiling to himself another terse message suddenly came through his helmet headset the planet toward which the escape capsule had headed had already been ident ified it was in galactic sector zz plural z alpha the kindly looking man in the tank seemed to be babbling gently to himself just as the co ­‐pilot had been in his tank little yellow bubbles beaded on the mans lips zaphod found a small speaker by the tank and turned it on he heard the man babbling gently about a shining city on a hill he also heard the official from the safety and civil reassurance administration issue instructions that the planet in zz plural z alpha must be made perfectly safe douglas adams mostly harmless for ron with grateful thanks to sue freestone and michael bywater for their support help and the constructive abuse anything that happens happens anything that in happening causes something else to happe n causes something else to happen anything that in happening causes itself to happen again happens again it doesnt necessarily do it in chronological order though chapter the history of the galaxy has got a little muddled for a number of reasons partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have got a little muddled but also because some very muddling things have been happening anyway one of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the difficulties involved in trying to exceed it you cant nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news which obeys its own special laws the hingefreel people of arkintoofle mi nor did try to build spaceships that were powered by bad news but they didnt work particularly well and were so extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there wasnt really any point in being there so by and large the peoples of the gal axy tended to languish in their own local muddles and the history of the galaxy itself was for a long time largely cosmological which is not to say that people werent trying they tried sending off fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in dist ant parts but these usually took thousands of years to get anywhere by the time they eventually arrived other forms of travel had been discovered which made use of hyperspace to circumvent the speed of light so that whatever battles it was that the slo wer­‐than ­‐light fleets had been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier by the time they actually got there this didnt of course deter their crews from wanting to fight the battles anyway they were trained they were ready they d had a couple of thousand years sleep theyd come a long way to do a tough job and by zarquon they were going to do it this was when the first major muddles of galactic history set in with battles continually re ­‐erupting centuries after the issues th ey had been fought over had supposedly been settled however these muddles were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and unravel once time ­‐travel was discovered and battles started pre ­‐ erupting hundreds of years before the issues even arose when the infinite improbability drive arrived and whole planets started turning unexpectedly into banana fruitcake the great history faculty of the university of maximegalon finally gave up closed itself down and surrendered its buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of divinity and water polo which had been after them for years which is all very well of course but it almost certainly means that no one will ever know for sure where for instance the grebulons came from or exactly what it w as they wanted and this is a pity because if anybody had known anything about them it is just possible that a most terrible catastrophe would have been averted ʹ or at least would have had to find a different way to happen click hum the huge grey grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently through the black void it was travelling at fabulous breath ­‐taking speed yet appeared against the glimmering background of a billion distant stars to be moving not at all it was just one dark s peck frozen against an infinite granularity of brilliant night on board the ship everything was as it had been for millennia deeply dark and silent click hum at least almost everything click click hum click hum click hum click hum click click click click click hum hmmm a low level supervising program woke up a slightly higher level supervising program deep in the ships semi ­‐somnolent cyberbrain and reported to it that whenever it went click all it got was a hum the higher level supervising program asked it what it was supposed to get and the low level supervising program said that it couldnt remember exactly but thought it was probably more of a sort of distant satisfied sigh wasnt it it didnt know what this hum was click hum click hum that was all it was getting the higher level supervising program considered this and didnt like it it asked the low level supervising program what exactly it was supervising and the low level supervising program said it couldn t remember that either just that it was something that was meant to go click sigh every ten years or so which usually happened without fail it had tried to consult its error look ­‐up table but couldnt find it which was why it had alerted the higher le vel supervising program to the problem the higher level supervising program went to consult one of its own look ­‐up tables to find out what the low level supervising program was meant to be supervising it couldnt find the look ­‐up table odd it looked again all it got was an error message it tried to look up the error message in its error message look ­‐up table and couldnt find that either it allowed a couple of nanoseconds to go by while it went through all this again then it woke up its sector function supervisor the sector function supervisor hit immediate problems it called its supervising agent which hit problems too within a few millionths of a second virtual circuits that had lain dormant some for years some for centuries were flaring into life throughout the ship something somewhere had gone terribly wrong but none of the supervising programs could tell what it was at every level vital instructions were missing and the instructions about what to do in the event of disco vering that vital instructions were missing were also missing small modules of software ­‐agents ­‐surged through the logical pathways grouping consulting re ­‐grouping they quickly established that the ships memory all the way back to its central missi on module was in tatters no amount of interrogation could determine what it was that had happened even the central mission module itself seemed to be damaged this made the whole problem very simple to deal with replace the central mission module the re was another one a backup an exact duplicate of the original it had to be physically replaced because for safety reasons there was no link whatsoever between the original and its backup once the central mission module was replaced it could itself s upervise the reconstruction of the rest of the system in every detail and all would be well robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module from the shielded strong room where they guarded it to the ships logic chamber for installat ion this involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authenticity of the instructions at last the robots were satisfied that all procedures were correct they unpacked the backup central mission module from its storage housing carried it out of the storage chamber fell out of the ship and went spinning off into the void this provided the first major clue as to what it was that was wrong further investigation quickly established what it was that had happened a meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship the ship had not previously detected this because the meteorite had neatly knocked out that part of the ships processing equipment which was supposed to detect if the ship had be en hit by a meteorite the first thing to do was to try to seal up the hole this turned out to be impossible because the ships sensors couldnt see that there was a hole and the supervisors which should have said that the sensors werent working proper ly werent working properly and kept saying that the sensors were fine the ship could only deduce the existence of the hole from the fact that the robots had clearly fallen out of it taking its spare brain which would have enabled it to see the hole with them the ship tried to think intelligently about this failed and then blanked out completely for a bit it didnt realise it had blanked out of course because it had blanked out it was merely surprised to see the stars jump after the third time the stars jumped the ship finally realised that it must be blanking out and that it was time to take some serious decisions it relaxed then it realised it hadnt actually taken the serious decisions yet and panicked it blanked out again for a bit wh en it awoke again it sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen hole must be it clearly hadnt got to its destination yet it thought fitfully but since it no longer had the faintest idea where its destination was or how to reach it ther e seemed to be little point in continuing it consulted what tiny scraps of instructions it could reconstruct from the tatters of its central mission module your year mission is to land a safe distance land monitor it all of the rest was complete garbage before it blanked out for good the ship would have to pass on those instructions such as they were to its more primitive subsidiary systems it must also revive all of its crew there was another problem while the crew was in hibernation the minds of all of its members their memories their identities and their understanding of what they had come to do had al l been transferred into the ships central mission module for safe keeping the crew would not have the faintest idea of who they were or what they were doing there oh well just before it blanked out for the final time the ship realised that its engine s were beginning to give out too the ship and its revived and confused crew coasted on under the control of its subsidiary automatic systems which simply looked to land wherever they could find to land and monitor whatever they could find to monitor as far as finding something to land on was concerned they didnt do very well the planet they found was desolately cold and lonely so achingly far from the sun that should warm it that it took all of the envir ­‐o­‐form machinery and lifesupport ­‐o­‐systems they carried with them to render it or at least enough parts of it habitable there were better planets nearer in but the ships strateej ­‐o­‐mat was obviously locked into lurk mode and chose the most distant and unobtrusive planet and further ­‐more woul d not be gainsaid by anybody other than the ships chief strategic officer since everybody on the ship had lost their minds no one knew who the chief strategic officer was or even if he could have been identified how he was supposed to go about gainsayi ng the ships strateej ­‐o­‐mat as far as finding something to monitor was concerned though they hit solid gold chapter one of the extraordinary things about life is the sort of places its prepared to put up with living anywhere it can get some ki nd of a grip whether its the intoxicating seas of santraginus v where the fish never seem to care whatever the heck kind of direction they swim in the fire storms of frastra where they say life begins at degrees or just burrowing around in th e lower intestine of a rat for the sheer unadulterated hell of it life will always find a way of hanging on in somewhere it will even live in new york though its hard to know why in the winter time the temperature falls well below the legal minimum or rather it would do if anybody had the common sense to set a legal minimum the last time anybody made a list of the top h undred character attributes of new yorkers common sense snuck in at number in the summer its too darn hot its one thing to be the sort of life form that thrives on heat and finds as the frastrans do that the temperature range between and is very equable but its quite another to be the sort of animal that has to wrap itself up in lots of other animals at one point in your planets orbit and then find half an orbit later that your skins bubbling spring is over ­‐rated a lot of the inhabitants of new york will honk on mightily about the pleasures of spring but if they actually knew the first thing about the pleasures of spring they would know of at least five thousand nine hundred and eighty ­‐three better places to spend it than new york and thats just on the same latitude fall though is the worst few things are worse than fall in new york some of the things that live in the lower intestines of rats would disagree but most of the things that live in the lower intestines of rats are highly disagreeable anyway so their opinion can and should be discoun ted when its fall in new york the air smells as if someones been frying goats in it and if you are keen to breathe the best plan is to open a window and stick your head in a building tricia mcmillan loved new york she kept on telling herself this over and over again the upper west side yeah mid town hey great retail soho the east village clothes books sushi italian delis yo movies yo also tricia had just been to see woody allens new movie which was all about the angst of being neu rotic in new york he had made one or two other movies that had explored the same theme and tricia wondered if he had ever considered moving but heard that he had set his face against the idea so more movies she guessed tricia loved new york because loving new york was a good career move it was a good retail move a good cuisine move not a good taxi move or a great quality of pavement move but definitely a career move that ranked amongst the highest and the best tricia was a tv anchor person and new york was where most of the worlds tv was anchored tricias tv anchoring had been done exclusively in britain up to that point regional news then breakfast news early evening news she would have been called if the language allowed a rapidly rising anchor but hey this is television what does it matter she was a rapidly rising anchor she had what it took great hair a profound understanding of strategic lip gloss the intelligence to understand the world and a tiny secret interior deadnes s which meant she didnt care everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life if you happen to miss the one you care about then everything else in life becomes eerily easy tricia had only ever missed one opportunity these days it didnt even make her tremble quite so much as it used to think about it she guessed it was that bit of her that had gone dead nbs needed a new anchor mo minetti was leaving the usam breakfast show to have a baby she had been offered a mind ­‐bubbling amount of mon ey to have it on the show but she had declined unexpectedly on grounds of personal privacy and taste teams of nbs lawyers had sieved through her contract to see if these constituted legitimate grounds but in the end reluctantly they had to let her g o this was for them particularly galling because normally reluctantly letting someone go was an expression that had its boot on quite another foot the word was out that maybe just maybe a british accent would fit the hair the skin tone and the b ridgework would have to be up to american network standards but there had been a lot of british accents up there thanking their mothers for their oscars a lot of british accents singing on broadway and some unusually big audiences tuning in to british a ccents in wigs on masterpiece theatre british accents were telling jokes on david letterman and jay leno nobody understood the jokes but they were really responding to the accents so maybe it was time just maybe a british accent on usam well hell that was why tricia was here this was why loving new york was a great career move it wasnt of course the stated reason her tv company back in the uk would hardly have stumped up the air fare and hotel bill for her to go job hunting in manhattan si nce she was chasing something like ten times her present salary they might have felt that she could have forked out her own expenses but shed found a story found a pretext kept very quiet about anything ulterior and theyd stumped up for the trip a business class ticket of course but her face was known and shed smiled herself an upgrade the right moves had got her a nice room at the brentwood and here she was wondering what to do next the word on the street was one thing making contact was an other she had a couple of names a couple of numbers but all it took was being put on indeterminate hold a couple of times and she was back at square one shed put out feelers left messages but so far none had been returned the actual job she had com e to do she had done in a morning the imagined job she was after was only shimmering tantalisingly on an unreachable horizon shit she caught a cab from the movie theatre back to the brentwood the cab couldnt get close to the kerb because a big stret ch limo was hogging all the available space and she had to squeeze her way past it she walked out of the fetid goat ­‐frying air and into the blessed cool of the lobby the fine cotton of her blouse was sticking like grime to her skin her hair felt as if shed bought it at a fairground on a stick at the front desk she asked if there were any messages grimly expecting none there was one oh good it had worked she had gone out to the movie specifically in order to make the phone ring she couldnt bear sitting in a hotel room waiting she wondered should she open the message down here her clothes were itching and she longed to take them all off and just lie on the bed she had turned the air conditioning way down to its bottom temperature settin g way up to its top fan setting what she wanted more than anything else in the world at the moment was goose pimples then a hot shower then a cool one then lying on a towel on the bed again drying in the air conditioning then reading the message m aybe more goose pimples maybe all sorts of things no what she wanted more than anything else in the world was a job in american television at ten times her current salary more than anything else in the world in the world what she wanted more than anything else at all was no longer a live issue she sat on a chair in the lobby under a kentia palm and opened the little cellophane ­‐windowed envelope please call it said not happy and gave a number the name was gail andrews gail andrews it wasnt a name she was expecting it caught her unawares she recognised it but couldnt immediately say why was she andy martins secretary hilary basss assistant martin and bass were the two major contact calls she had made or tried to make at nbs and what did not happy mean not happy she was completely bewildered was this woody allen trying to contact her under an assumed name it was a area code number so it was someone in new york who was not happy well that narrowed it down a bit didnt it she went back to the receptionist at the desk i have a problem with this message you just gave me she said someone i dont know has tried to call me and says shes not happy the receptionist peered at the note with a frown do you know this person he said no tricia said hmmm said the receptionist sounds like shes not happy about something yes said tricia looks like theres a name here said the receptionist gail andrews do you know anybody of that name no said tricia any idea what shes unhappy about no said tricia have you called the number theres a number here no said trici a you only just gave me the note im just trying to get some more information before i ring back perhaps i could talk to the person who took the call hmmm said the receptionist scrutinising the note carefully i dont think we have anybody call ed gail andrews here no i realise that said tricia i just ʹ im gail andrews the voice came from behind tricia she turned round im sorry im gail andrews you interviewed me this morning oh oh good heavens yes said tricia slightly flustered i left the message for you a few hours ago i hadnt heard so i came by i didnt want to miss you oh no of course said tricia trying hard to get up to speed i dont know about this said the receptionist for whom speed was not an issue would you like me to try this number for you now no thatll be fine thanks said tricia i can handle it now i can call this room number here for you if thatll help said the receptio nist peering at the note again no that wont be necessary thanks said tricia thats my own room number im the one the message was for i think weve sorted this out now you have a nice day now said the receptionist tricia didnt particu larly want to have a nice day she was busy she also didnt want to talk to gail andrews she had a very strict cut­‐off point as far as fraternising with the christians was concerned her colleagues called her interview subjects christians and would often cross themselves when they saw one walking innocently into the studio to face tricia particularly if tricia was smiling warmly and showing her teeth she turned and smiled frostily wondering what to do gail andrews was a well ­‐groomed woman in her mi d­‐forties her clothes fell within the boundaries defined by expensive good taste but were definitely huddled up at the floatier end of those boundaries she was an astrologer ʹ a famous and if rumour were true influential astrologer having allegedly i nfluenced a number of decisions made by the late pr esident hudson including every thing from which flavour of cream whip to have on which day of the week to whether or not to bomb damascus tricia had savaged her more than somewhat not on the grounds of whether or not the stories about the president were true that was old hat now at the time ms andrews had emphatically denied advising president hudson on anything other than personal spiritual or dietary matters which did not apparently include the bombing of damascus nothing personal damascus the tabloids had hooted at the time no this was a neat topical little angle that tricia had come up with about the whole issue of astrology itself ms andrews had not been entirely ready for it tric ia on the other hand was not entirely ready for a re ­‐match in the hotel lobby what to do i can wait for you in the bar if you need a few minutes said gail andrews but i would like to talk to you and im leaving the city tonight she seemed to be slightly anxious about something rather than aggrieved or irate ok said tricia give me ten minutes she went up to her room apart from anything else she had so little faith in the ability of the guy on the message desk at recept ion to deal with anything as complicated as a message that she wanted to be doubly certain that there wasnt a note under the door it wouldnt be the first time that messages at the desk and messages under the door had been completely at odds with each ot her there wasnt one the message light on the phone was flashing though she hit the message button and got the hotel operator you have a message from gary andress said the operator yes said tricia an unfamiliar name what does it say not hippy said the operator not what said tricia hippy what it says guy says hes not a hippy i guess he wanted you to know that you want the number as she started to dictate the number tricia suddenly realised that this was just a garbled version of the message she had already had ok ok she said are there any other messages for me room number tricia couldnt work out why the operator should suddenly ask for her number this late in the conversation but gave it to her anyway name mcmillan tricia mcmillan tricia spelt it patiently not mr macmanus no no more messages for you click tricia sighed and dialled again this time she gave her name and room number all over again up front the operator showed not the slightest glimmer of recognition that they had been speaking less than ten seconds ago im going to be in the bar tricia explained in the bar if a phone call comes through for me please would you put it through to me in the bar name they went through it all a couple more times till tricia was certain that everything that possibly could be clear was as clear as it possibly could be she showered put on fresh clothes and retouched her makeup with the speed of a professional and loo king at her bed with a sigh left the room again she had half a mind just to sneak off and hide no not really she had a look at herself in the mirror in the elevator lobby while she was waiting she looked cool and in charge and if she could fool herself she could fool anybody she was just going to have to tough it out with gail andrews ok she had given her a hard time sorry but thats the game were all in ʹ that sort of thing ms andrews had agreed to do the interview because she had a new book out and tv exposure was free publicity but theres no such thing as a free launch no she edited that line out again what had happened was this last week astronomers had announced that they had at last discovered a tenth planet out beyond the orbit of pluto they had been searching for it for years guided by certain orbital anomalies in the outer planets and now theyd found it and they were all terribly pleased and everyone was terribly happy for them and so on the planet was named persephone but rapidly nicknamed rupert after some astronomers parrot ʹ there was some tediously heart ­‐warming story attache d to this ʹ and that was all very wonderful and lovely tricia had followed the story with for various reasons considerable interest then while she had been casting around for a good excuse to go to new york at her tv companys expense she had happen ed to notice a press release about gail andrews and her new book you and your planets gail andrews was not exactly a household name but the moment you mentioned president hudson cream whips and the amputation of damascus the world had moved on from surgical strikes the official term had in fact been damascectomy meaning the taking out of damascus everyone remembered who you meant tricia saw an angle here which she quickly sold to her producer surely the notion that great lumps of rock whi rling in space knew something about your day that you didnt must take a bit of a knock from the fact that there was suddenly a new lump of rock out there that nobody had known about before that must throw a few calculations out mustnt it what about all those star charts and planetary motions and so we all knew apparently what happened when neptune was in virgo and so on but what about when rupert was rising wouldnt the whole of astrology have to be rethought wouldnt now perhaps be a good tim e to own up that it was all just a load of hogwash and instead take up pig ­‐farming the principles of which were founded on some kind of rational basis if wed known about rupert three years ago might president hudson have been eating the boysenberry fla vour on thursday rather than friday might damascus still be standing that sort of thing gail andrews had taken it all reasonably well she was just starting to recover from the initial onslaught when she made the rather serious mistake of trying to sh ake tricia off by talking smoothly about diurnal arcs right ascensions and some of the more abstruse areas of three ­‐dimensional trigonometry to her shock she discovered that everything she delivered to tricia came right back at her with more spin on it than she could cope with nobody had warned gail that being a tv bimbo was for tricia her second stab at a role in life behind her chanel lip gloss her coupe sauvage and her crystal blue contact lenses lay a brain that had acquired for itself in an ea rlier abandoned phase of her life a first class degree in mathematics and a doctorate in astrophysics as she was getting into the elevator tricia slightly preoccupied realised she had left her bag in her room and wondered whether to duck back out an d get it no it was probably safer where it was and there wasnt anything she particularly needed in it she let the door close behind her besides she told herself taking a deep breath if life had taught her anything it was this never go back for yo ur bag as the elevator went down she stared up at the ceiling in a rather intent way anyone who didnt know tricia mcmillan better would have said that that was exactly the way people sometimes stared upwards when they were trying to hold back tears sh e must have been staring at the tiny security video camera mounted up in the corner she marched rather briskly out of the elevator a minute later and went up to the reception desk again now im going to write this out she said because i dont wan t anything to go wrong she wrote her name in large letters on a piece of paper then her room number then in the bar and gave it to the receptionist who looked at it thats in case theres a message for me ok the receptionist continued to loo k at it you want me to see if shes in her room he said two minutes later tricia swivelled into the bar seat next to gail andrews who was sitting in front of a glass of white wine you struck me as the sort of person who preferred to sit up at the bar rather than demurely at a table she said this was true and caught tricia a little by surprise vodka said gail yes said tricia suspiciously she just stopped herself asking how did you know but gail answered anyway i asked the barman she said with a kindly smile the barman had her vodka ready for her and slid it charmingly across the glossy mahogany thank you said tricia stirring it sharply she didnt know quite what to make out of all this sudden niceness and was determined not to be wrong ­‐footed by it people in new york were not nice to each other without reason ms andrews she said firmly im sorry that youre not happy i know yo u probably feel i was a bit rough with you this morning but astrology is after all just popular entertainment which is fine its part of showbiz and its a part that you have done well out of and good luck to you its fun its not a science though and it shouldnt be mistaken for one i think thats something we both managed to demonstrate very successfully together this morning while at the same time generating some popular entertainment which is what we both do for a living im sorry if you hav e a problem with that im perfectly happy said gail andrews oh said tricia not quite certain what to make of this it said in your message that you were not happy no said gail andrews i said in my message that i thought you were not ha ppy and i was just wondering why tricia felt as if she had been kicked in the back of the head she blinked what she said quietly to do with the stars you seemed very angry and unhappy about something to do with stars and planets when we were having our discussion and its been bothering me which is why i came to see if you were all right tricia stared at her ms andrews ʹ she started and then realised that the way she had said it sounded exactly angry and unhappy and rather undermine d the protest she had been trying to make please call me gail if thats ok tricia just looked bewildered i know that astrology isnt a science said gail of course it isnt its just an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis or whats that strange thing you british play er cricket self ­‐loathing parliamentary democracy the rules just kind of got there they dont make any kind of sense except in terms of themselves but when you start to exercise those rules all sorts of processes start to happen and you start to find out all sorts of stuff about people in astrology the rules happen to b e about stars and planets but they could be about ducks and drakes for all the difference it would make its just a way of thinking about a problem which lets the shape of that problem begin to emerge the more rules the tinier the rules the more arbit rary they are the better its like throwing a handful of fine graphite dust on a piece of paper to see where the hidden indentations are it lets you see the words that were written on the piece of paper above it thats now been taken away and hidden th e graphites not important its just the means of revealing their indentations so you see astrologys nothing to do with astronomy its just to do with people thinking about people so when you got so i dont know so emotionally focused on stars and planets this morning i began to think shes not angry about astrology she really is angry and unhappy about actual stars and planets people usually only get that unhappy and angry when theyve lost something thats all i could think and i couldnt m ake any more sense of it than that so i came to see if you were ok tricia was stunned one part of her brain had already got started on all sorts of stuff it was busy constructing all sorts of rebuttals to do with how ridiculous newspaper horoscopes were and the sort of statistical tricks they played on people but gradually it petered out because it realised that the rest of her brain wasnt listening she had been completely stunned she had just been told by a total stranger something shed kep t completely secret for seventeen years she turned to look at gail i she stopped a tiny security camera up behind the bar had turned to follow her movement this completely flummoxed her most people would not have noticed it it was not design ed to be noticed it was not designed to suggest that nowadays even an expensive and elegant hotel in new york couldnt be sure that its clientele wasnt suddenly going to pull a gun or not wear a tie but carefully hidden though it was behind the vodka i t couldnt deceive the finely honed instinct of a tv anchor person which was to know exactly when a camera was turning to look at her is something wrong asked gail no i i have to say that youve rather astonished me said tricia she decided to ignore the security camera it was just her imagination playing tricks with her because she had television so much on her mind today it wasnt the first time it had happened a traffic monitoring camera she was convinced had swung round to follow her as she walked past it and a security camera in bloomingdales had seemed to make a particular point of watching her trying on hats she was obviously going dotty she had even imagined that a bird in central park had been peering at her rather intently she decided to put it out of her mind and took a sip of her vodka someone was walking round the bar asking people if they were mr macmanus ok she said suddenly blurting it out i dont know how you worked it out but i didnt work it out as you put it i just listened to what you were saying what i lost i think was a whole other life everybody does that every moment of every day every single decision we make every breath we draw opens some doors and closes many others most of them we dont notice some we do sounds like you noticed one oh yes i noticed said tricia all r ight here it is its very simple many years ago i met a guy at a party he said he was from another planet and did i want to go along with him i said yes ok it was that kind of party i said to him to wait while i went to get my bag and then id be happy to go off to another planet with him he said i wouldnt need my bag i said he obviously came from a very backward planet or hed know that a woman always needed to take her bag with her he got a bit impatient but i wasnt gong to be a complete pu shover just because he said he was from another planet i went upstairs took me a while to find my bag and then there was someone else in the bathroom came down and he was gone tricia paused and said gail the garden door was open i went outside there were lights some kind of gleaming thing i was just in time to see it rise up into the sky shoot silently up through the clouds and disappear that was it end of story end of one life beginning of another but hardly a moment of this l ife goes by that i dont wonder about some other me a me that didnt go back for her bag i feel like shes out there somewhere and im walking in her shadow a member of the hotel staff was now going round the bar asking people if they were mr miller nobody was you really think this person was from another planet asked gail oh certainly there was the spacecraft oh and also he had two heads two didnt anybody else notice it was a fancy dress party i see and he had a bi rd cage over it of course with a cloth over the cage pretended he had a parrot he tapped on the cage and it did a lot of stupid pretty polly stuff and squawking and so on then he pulled the cloth back for a moment and roared with laughter there was another head in there laughing along with him it was a worrying moment i can tell you i think you probably did the right thing dear dont you said gail no said tricia no i dont and i couldnt carry on doing what i was doing either i was an astrophysicist you see you cant be an astrophysicist properly if youve actually met someone from another planet whos got a second head that pretends to be a parrot you just cant do it i couldnt at least i can see it would be hard and t hats probably why you tend to be a little hard on other people who talk what sounds like complete nonsense yes said tricia i expect youre right im sorry thats ok youre the first person ive ever told this by the way i wondered y ou married er no so hard to tell these days isnt it but youre right to ask because that was probably the reason i came very close a few times mostly because i wanted to have a kid but every guy ended up asking why i was constantly looking over his shoulder what do you tell someone at one point i even thought i might just go to a sperm bank and take pot luck have somebodys child at random you cant seriously do that can you tricia laughed probably not i never quite went and found o ut for real never quite did it story of my life never quite did the real thing thats why im in television i guess nothing is real excuse me lady your name tricia mcmillan tricia looked round in surprise there was a man standing there in a chauffeurs hat yes she said instantly pulling herself back together again lady i been looking for you for about an hour hotel said they didnt have anybody of that name but i checked back with mr martins office and they said that this was def initely where you staying so i ask again they still say they never heard of you so i get them to page you anyway and they cant find you in the end i get the office to fax a picture of you through to the car and have a look myself he looked at his w atch may be a bit late now but do you want to go anyway tricia was stunned mr martin you mean andy martin at nbs thats correct lady screen test for usam tricia shot up out of her seat she couldnt even bear to think of all the messages shed heard for mr macmanus and mr miller only we have to hurry said the chauffeur as i heard it mr martin thinks it might be worth trying a british accent his b oss at the network is dead against the idea thats mr zwingler and i happen to know hes flying out to the coast this evening because im the one has to pick him up and take him to the airport ok said tricia im ready lets go ok lady it s the big limo out the front tricia turned back to gail im sorry she said go go said gail and good luck ive enjoyed meeting you tricia made to reach for her bag for some cash damn she said shed left it upstairs drinks are on me insisted gail really its been very interesting tricia sighed look im really sorry about this morning and dont say another word im fine its only astrology its harmless its not the end of the world thanks on an impulse t ricia gave her a hug you got everything said the chauffeur you dont want to pick up your bag or anything if theres one thing that lifes taught me said tricia its never go back for your bag just a little over an hour later tric ia sat on one of the pair of beds in her hotel room for a few minutes she didnt move she just stared at her bag which was sitting innocently on top of the other bed in her hand was a note from gail andrews saying dont be too disappointed do ring if you want to talk about it if i were you id stay in at home tomorrow night get some rest but dont mind me and dont worry its only astrology its not the end of the world gail the chauffeur had been dead right in fact the chauffeur seemed to know more about what was going on inside nbs than any other single person she had encountered in the organisation martin had been keen zwingler had not she had had her one shot at proving martin right and she had blown it oh well oh well oh well oh well time to go home time to phone the airline and see if she could still get the red ­‐eye back to heathrow tonight she reached for the big phone directory oh first things first she put down the directory again picked up her handbag and took it through to the bathroom she put it down and took out the small plastic case which held her contact lenses without which she had been unable properly to read either the script or the autocue as she dabbed each tiny plastic cup into her eyes she refl ected that if there was one thing life had taught her it was that there are times when you do not go back for your bag and other times when you do it had yet to teach her to distinguish between the two types of occasion chapter the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy has in what we laughingly call the past had a great deal to say on the subject of parallel universes very little of this is however at all comprehensible to anyone below the level of advanced god and since it is n ow well ­‐established that all known gods came into existence a good three millionths of a second after the universe began rather than as they usually claimed the previous week they already have a great deal of explaining to do as it is and are therefore not available for comment on matters of deep physics at this time one encouraging thing the guide does have to say on the subject of parallel universes is that you dont stand the remotest chance of understanding it you can therefore say what and e h and even go cross ­‐eyed and start to blither if you like without any fear of making a fool of yourself the first thing to realise about parallel universes the guide says is that they are not parallel it is also important to realise that they are n ot strictly speaking universes either but it is easiest if you try and realise that a little later after youve realised that everything youve realised up to that moment is not true the reason they are not universes is that any given universe is not actually a thing as such but is just a way of looking at what is technically known as the wsogmm or whole sort of general mish mash the whole sort of general mish mash doesnt actually exist either but is just the sum total of all the different ways t here would be of looking at it if it did the reason they are not parallel is the same reason that the sea is not parallel it doesnt mean anything you can slice the whole sort of general mish mash any way you like and you will generally come up with so mething that someone will call home please feel free to blither now the earth with which we are here concerned because of its particular orientation in the whole sort of general mish mash was hit by a neutrino that other earths were not a neutrino is not a big thing to be hit by in fact its hard to think of anything much smaller by which one could reasonably hope to be hit and its not as if being hit by neutrinos was in itself a particularly unusual event for something the size of th e earth far from it it would be an unusual nanosecond in which the earth was not hit by several billion passing neutrinos it all depends on what you mean by hit of course seeing as matter consists almost entirely of nothing at all the chances of a neutrino actually hitting something as it travels through all this howling emptiness are roughly comparable to that of dropping a ball bearing at random from a cruising and hitting say an egg sandwich anyway this neutrino hit something nothing t erribly important in the scale of things you might say but the problem with saying something like that is that you would be talking cross ­‐eyed badger spit once something actually happens somewhere in something as wildly complicated as the universe kevi n knows where it will all end up ʹ where kevin is any random entity that doesnt know nothin about nothin this neutrino struck an atom the atom was part of a molecule the molecule was part of a nucleic acid the nucleic acid was part of a gene th e gene was part of a genetic recipe for growing and so on the upshot was that a plant ended up growing an extra leaf in essex or what would after a lot of palaver and local difficulties of a geological nature become essex the plant was a clover it threw its weight or rather its seed around extremely effectively and rapidly became the worlds dominant type of clover the precise causal connection between this tiny biological happenstance and a few other minor variations that exist in that slice of the whole sort of general mish mash ʹ such as tricia mcmillan failing to leave with zaphod beeblebrox abnormally low sales of pecan ­‐flavoured ice ­‐cream and the fact that the earth on which all this occurred did not get demolished by the vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass ʹ is currently sitting at number on the research project priority list at what was once the history department of the university of maximegalon and no one currently at the prayer meeting by the poolside appea rs to feel any sense of urgency about the problem chapter tricia began to feel that the world was conspiring against her she knew that this was a perfectly normal way to feel after an overnight flight going east when you suddenly have a whole other mysteriously threatening day to deal with for which you are not the least bit prepared but still there were marks on her lawn she didnt really care about marks on her lawn very much marks on her lawn could go and take a running jump as far as she was concerned it was saturday morning she had just got home fro m new york feeling tired crabby and paranoid and all she wanted to do was go to bed with the radio on quietly and gradually fall asleep to the sound of ned sherrin being terribly clever about something but eric bartlett was not going to let her get awa y with not making a thorough inspection of the marks eric was the old gardener who came in from the village on saturday mornings to poke around at her garden with a stick he didnt believe in people coming in from new york first thing in the morning did nt hold with it went against nature he believed in virtually everything else though probably them space aliens he said bending over and prod ­‐ding at the edges of the small indentations with his stick hear a lot about space aliens these days i expect its them do you said tricia looking furtively at her watch ten minutes she reckoned ten minutes shed be able to stay standing up then she would simply keel over whether she was in her bedroom or still out here in the garden that was i f she just had to stand if she also had to nod intelligently and say do you from time to time it might cut it down to five oh yes said eric they come down here land on your lawn and then buzz off again sometimes with your cat mrs williams at the post office her cat ʹ you know the ginger one ʹ it got abducted by space aliens course they brought it back the next day but it were in a very odd mood kept prowling around all morning and then falling asleep in the afternoon used to be the o ther way round is the point sleep in the morning prowl in the afternoon jet lag you see from being in an interplanetary craft i see said tricia they dyed it tabby too she says these marks are exactly the sort of marks that their landing p ods would probably make you dont think its the lawn mower asked tricia if the marks were more round id say but these are just off ­‐round you see altogether more alien in shape its just that you mentioned the lawn mower was playing up an d needed fixing or it might start gouging holes in the lawn i did say that miss tricia and i stand by what i said im not saying its not the lawn mower for definite im just saying what seems to me more likely given the shapes of the holes they c ome in over these trees you see in their landing pods eric said tricia patiently tell you what though miss tricia said eric i will take a look at the mower like i meant to last week and leave you to get on with whatever youre want ing to thank you eric said tricia im going to bed now in fact help yourself to anything you want in the kitchen thank you miss tricia and good luck to you said eric he bent over and picked something from the lawn there he said t hree ­‐leaf clover good luck you see he peered at it closely to check that it was a real three ­‐leaf clover and not just a regular four ­‐leaf one that one of the leaves had fallen off if i were you though id watch for signs of alien activity in the area he scanned the horizon keenly particularly from over there in the henley direction thank you eric said tricia again i will she went to bed and dreamt fitfully of parrots and other birds in the afternoon she got up and prowled around res tlessly not certain what to do with the rest of the day or indeed the rest of her life she spent at least an hour dithering trying to make up her mind whether to head up into town and go to stavros for the evening this was the currently fashionable s pot for high ­‐flying media people and seeing a few friends there might help her ease herself back into the swing of things she decided at last she would go it was good it was fun there she was very fond of stavro himself who was a greek with a german father ʹ a fairly odd combination tricia had been to the alpha a couple of nights earlier which was stavros original club in new york now run by his brother karl who thought of himself as a german with a greek mother stavro would be very happy to be told that karl was making a bit of a pigs ear of running the new york club so tricia would go and make him happy there was little love lost between stavro and karl mueller ok thats what she would do she then spent another hour dithering about what to wear at last she settled on a smart little black dress shed got in new york she phoned a friend to see who was likely to be at the club that evening and was told that it was closed this evening for a private wedding party she thought that trying to live l ife according to any plan you actually work out is like trying to buy ingredients for a recipe from the supermarket you get one of those trolleys which simply will not go in the direction you push it and end up just having to buy completely different stuf f what do you do with it what do you do with the recipe she didnt know anyway that night an alien spacecraft landed on her lawn chapter she watched it coming in from over the henley direction with mild curiosity at first wondering what those lights were living as she did not a million miles from heathrow she was used to seeing lights in the sky not usually so late in the evening or so low though which was why she was mildly curious when whatever it was began to come closer and closer her curiosity began to turn to bemusement hmmm she thought which was about as far as she could get with thinking she was still feeling dopey and jet ­‐lagged and the messages that one part of her brain was busy sending to another were not necessarily arriving on time or the right way up she left the kitchen where shed been fixing herself a coffee and went to open the back door which led out to the garden she took a deep breath of cool evening air stepped outside and looked up there was something roughly the size of a large camper van parked about a hundred feet above her lawn it was really there hanging there almost silent something mo ved deep inside her her arms dropped slowly down to her side she didnt notice the scalding coffee slopping over her foot she was hardly breathing as slowly inch by inch foot by foot the craft came downwards its lights were playing softly over the ground as if probing and feeling it they played over her it seemed beyond all hope that she should be given her chance again had he found her had he come back the craft dropped down and down until at last it had settled quietly on her lawn it didnt look exactly like the one she had seen departing all those years ago she thought but flashing lights in the night sky are hard to resolve into clear shapes silence then a click and a hum then another click and another hum click hum click hum a doorway slid open spilling light towards her across the lawn she waited tingling a figure stood silhouetted in the light then another and another wide eyes blinked slowly at her hands were slowly raised in greeting mcmillan a voice said at last a strange thin voice that managed the syllables with difficulty tricia mcmillan ms tricia mcmillan yes said tricia almost soundlessly we have been monitoring you m monitoring me yes they looked at her for a while their large eyes moving up and down her very slowly you look smaller in real life one said at last what said tricia yes i i dont understand said tricia she hadnt expected any of this of course but even for something she hadnt expected to begin with it wasnt going the way she expected at last she said are you are you from zaphod this question seemed to cause a little consternation among the three figures they conferred with each other in some skittering language of their own and then turned back to her we dont think so not as far as we know said one where is zaphod said another looking up into the night sky i i dont know said tricia helplessly is it far from here which direction we dont know tricia realised with a sinking heart that they had no idea who she was talking about or even what she was talking about and she had no idea what they were talking about she put her hopes tightly away again and snapped her brain back into gear there was no point in being disappointed she had to wake up to the fact that she had here the journalistic scoop of the century what should she do go back into the house for a video camera wouldnt they just be gone when she got back she was thoroughly confuse d as to strategy keepem talking she thought figure it out later youve been monitoring me all of you everything on your planet tv radio telecommunications computers video circuitry warehouses what car parks everything we moni tor everything tricia stared at them that must be very boring isnt it she blurted out yes so why except yes except what game shows we quite like game shows there was a terribly long silence as tricia looked at the alie ns and the aliens looked at her theres something i would just like to get from indoors said tricia very deliberately tell you what would you or one of you like to come inside with me and have a look very much they all said enthusiasticall y all three of them stood slightly awkwardly in her sitting room as she hurried around picking up a video camera a mm camera a tape recorder every recording medium she could grab hold of they were all thin and under domestic lighting conditions a sort of dim purplish green i really wont be a second guys tricia said as she rummaged through some drawers for spare tapes and films the aliens were looking at the shelves that held her cds and her old records one of them nudged one of the oth ers very slightly look he said elvis tricia stopped and stared at them all over again you like elvis she said yes they said elvis presley yes she shook her head in bewilderment as she tried to stuff a new tape into her video camera some of your people said one of her visitors hesitantly think that elvis has been kidnapped by space aliens what said tricia has he it is possible are you telling me that you have kidnapped elvis gasped tricia she was trying to keep cool enough not to foul up her equipment but this was all almost too much for her no not us said her guests aliens it is a very interesting possibility we talk of it often i must get this down tricia muttered to herself she checked her video was properly loaded and working now she pointed the camera at them she didnt put it up to her eye because she didnt want to freak them out but she was su fficiently experienced to be able to shoot accurately from the hip ok she said now tell me slowly and carefully who you are you first she said to the one on the left whats your name i dont know you dont know no i see said t ricia and what about you other two we dont know good ok perhaps you can tell me where you are from they shook their heads you dont know where youre from they shook their heads again so said tricia what are you er she was floundering but being a professional kept the camera steady while she did it we are on a mission said one of the aliens a mission a mission to do what we do not know still she kept the camera steady so what are you doing here on earth then we have come to fetch you rock steady rock steady could have been on a tripod she wondered if she should be using a tripod in fact she wondered that because it gave her a moment or two to digest what t hey had just said no she thought hand ­‐held gave her more flexibility she also thought help what am i going to do why she asked calmly have you come to fetch me because we have lost our minds excuse me said tricia im going to have to get a tripod they seemed happy enough to stand there doing nothing while tricia quickly found a tripod and mounted the camera on it her face was completely immobile but she did not have the faintest idea what was going on or what to think about it ok she said when she was ready why we liked your interview with the astrologer you saw it we see everything we are very interested in astrology we like it it is very interesting not eve rything is interesting astrology is interesting what the stars tell us what the stars foretell we could do with some information like that but tricia didnt know where to start own up she thought theres no point in trying to second guess any of this stuff so she said but i dont know anything about astrology we do you do yes we follow our horoscopes we are very avid we see all your newspapers and your magazines and are very avid with them but our leader says we have a p roblem you have a leader yes whats his name we do not know what does he say his name is for christs sake sorry ill need to edit that what does he say his name is he does not know so how do you all know hes the leader he seized control he said someone has to do something round here ah said tricia seizing on a clue where is here rupert what your people call it rupert the tenth planet from your sun we have settled there for many years it is hig hly cold and uninteresting there but good for monitoring why are you monitoring us it is all we know to do ok said tricia right what is the problem that your leader says you have triangulation i beg your pardon astrology is a very precise science we know this well said tricia then left it at that but it is precise for you here on earth ye e s she had a horrible feeling she was getting a vague glimmering of something so when venus is rising in capricorn for instance that is from earth how does that work if we are out on rupert what if the earth is rising in capricorn it is hard for us to know amongst the things we have forgotten which we think are many and profound is trigonom etry let me get this straight said tricia you want me to come with you to rupert yes to recalculate your horoscopes for you to take account of the relative positions of earth and rupert yes do i get an exclusive yes im your girl said tricia thinking that at the very least she could sell it to the national enquirer as she boarded the craft that would take her off to the furthest limits of the solar system the first thing that met her eyes was a bank of video mo nitors across which thousands of images were sweeping a fourth alien was sitting watching them but was focused on one particular screen that held a steady image it was a replay of the impromptu interview which tricia had just conducted with his three colleagues he looked up when he saw her apprehensively climbing in good evening ms mcmillan he said nice camera work chapter ford prefect hit the ground running the ground was about three inches further from the ventilation shaft than h e remembered it so he misjudged the point at which he would hit the ground started running too soon stumbled awkwardly and twisted his ankle damn he ran off down the corridor anyway hobbling slightly all over the building alarms were erupting into their usual frenzy of excitement he dived for cover behind the usual storage cabinets glanced around to check that he was unseen and started rapidly to fish around inside his satchel for the usual things he needed his ankle unusually was hurting lik e hell the ground was not only three inches further from the ventilation shaft than he remembered it was also on a different planet than he remembered but it was the three inches that had caught him by surprise the offices of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy were quite often shifted at very short notice to another planet for reasons of local climate local hostility power bills or tax but they were always reconstructed exactly the same way almost to the very molecule for many of the companys employees the layout of their offices represented the only constant they knew in a severely distorted personal universe something though was odd this was not in itself surprising thought ford as he pulled out his lightweight throwing towel virtually everything in his life was to a greater or lesser extent odd it was just that this was odd in a slightly different way than he was used to things being odd which was well strange he couldnt quite get it into focus immediately he got out his no gauge prising tool the alarms were going in the same old way that he knew well there was a kind of music to them that he could almost hum along to that was all very familiar the world outside had been a new one on ford he had not been to saquo ­‐pilia hensha before and he had liked it it had a kind of carnival atmosphere to it he took from his satchel a toy bow and arrow which he had bought in a street market he had discovered that the reason for the carnival atmosphere on saquo ­‐pilia hensha was that the local people were celebrating the annual feast of the assumption of st antwelm st antwelm had been during his lifetime a great and popular king who had made a great and popular assumption what king antwelm had assumed was that what everybody wanted all other things being equal was to be happy and enjoy themselves and have the best possible time together on his death he had willed his ent ire personal fortune to financing an annual festival to remind every one of this with lots of good food and dancing and very silly games like hunt the wocket his assumption had been such a brilliantly good one that he was made into a saint for it not on ly that but all the people who had previously been made saints for doing things like being stoned to death in a thoroughly miserable way or living upside down in barrels of dung were instantly demoted and were now thought to be rather embarrassing the f amiliar h ­‐shaped building of the hitchhikers guide offices rose above the outskirts of the city and ford prefect had broken into it in the familiar way he always entered via the ventilation system rather than the main lobby because the main lobby was pa trolled by robots whose job it was to quiz incoming employees about their expense accounts ford prefects expense accounts were notoriously complex and difficult affairs and he had found on the whole that the lobby robots were ill ­‐equipped to understand the arguments he wished to put forward in relation to them he preferred therefore to make his entrance by another route this meant setting off nearly every alarm in the building but not the one in the accounts department which was the way that ford preferred it he hunkered down behind the storage cabinet he licked the rubber suction cup of the toy arrow and then fitted it to the string of the bow within about thirty seconds a security robot the size of a small melon came flying down the corrid or at about waist height scanning left and right for anything unusual as it did so with impeccable timing ford shot the toy arrow across its path the arrow flew across the corridor and stuck wobbling on the opposite wall as it flew the robots sens ors locked on to it instantly and the robot twisted through ninety degrees to follow it see what the hell it was and where it was going this bought ford one precious second during which the robot was looking in the opposite direction from him he hurle d the towel over the flying robot and caught it because of the various sensory protuberances with which the robot was festooned it couldnt manoeuvre inside the towel and it just twitched back and forth without being able to turn and face its captor ford hauled it quickly towards him and pinned it down to the ground it was beginning to whine pitifully with one swift and practised movement ford reached under the towel with his no gauge prising tool and flipped off the small plastic panel on top o f the robot which gave access to its logic circuits now logic is a wonderful thing but it has as the processes of evolution discovered certain drawbacks anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something else which thinks at least as logically as it does the easiest way to fool a completely logical robot is to feed it the same stimulus sequence over and over again so it gets locked in a loop this was best demonstrated by the famous herring sandwich experiments conducted millennia ago at mispw oso the maximegalon institute of slowly and painfully working out the surprisingly obvious a robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches this was actually the most difficult part of the whole experiment once the robot had been pr ogrammed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches a herring sandwich was placed in front of it whereupon the robot thought to itself ah a herring sandwich i like herring sandwiches it would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich in it s herring sandwich scoop and then straighten up again unfortunately for the robot it was fashioned in such a way that the action of straightening up caused the herring sandwich to slip straight back off its herring sandwich scoop and fall on to the floo r in front of the robot whereupon the robot thought to itself ah a herring sandwich etc and repeated the same action over and over and over again the only thing that prevented the herring sandwich from getting bored with the whole damn business and crawling off in search of other ways of passing the time was that the herring sandwich being just a bit of dead fish between a couple of slices of bread was marginally less alert to what was going on than was the robot the scientists at the institu te thus discovered the driving force behind all change development and innovation in life which was this herring sandwiches they published a paper to this effect which was widely criticised as being extremely stupid they checked their figures and rea lised that what they had actually discovered was boredom or rather the practical function of boredom in a fever of excitement they then went on to discover other emotions like irritability depression reluctance ickiness and so on the next big breakthrough came when they stopped using herring sandwiches whereupon a whole welter of new emotions became suddenly available to them for study such as relief joy friskiness appetite satisfaction and most important of all the desir e for happiness this was the biggest breakthrough of all vast wodges of complex computer code governing robot behaviour in all possible contingencies could be replaced very simply all that robots needed was the capacity to be either bored or happy and a few conditions that needed to be satisfied in order to bring those states about they would then work the rest out for themselves the robot which ford had got trapped under his towel was not at the moment a happy robot it was happy when it could move about it was happy when it could see other things it was particularly happy when it could see other things moving about particularly if the other things were moving about doing things they shouldnt do because it could then with considerable delig ht report them ford would soon fix that he squatted over the robot and held it between his knees the towel was still covering all of its sensory mechanisms but ford had now got its logic circuits exposed the robot was whirring grungily and pettishl y but it could only fidget it couldnt actually move using the prising tool ford eased a small chip out from its socket as soon as it came out the robot went quiet and just sat there in a coma the chip ford had taken out was the one which contained the instructions for all the conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for the robot to feel happy the robot would be happy when a tiny electrical charge from a point just to the left of the chip reached another point just to the right of the chip th e chip determined whether the charge got there or not ford pulled out a small length of wire that had been threaded into the towel he dug one end of it into the top left hole of the chip socket and the other into the bottom right hole that was all it took now the robot would be happy whatever happened ford quickly stood up and whisked the towel away the robot rose ecstatically into the air pursuing a kind of wriggly path it turned and saw ford mr prefect sir im so happy to see you good to see you little fella said ford the robot rapidly reported back to its central control that everything was now for the best in this best of all possible worlds the alarms rapidly quelled themselves and life returned to normal at least almost to normal there was something odd about the place the little robot was gurgling with electric delight ford hurried on down the corridor letting the thing bob along in his wake telling him how delicious everything was and how happy i t was to be able to tell him that ford however was not happy he passed faces of people he didnt know they didnt look like his sort of people they were too well groomed their eyes were too dead every time he thought he saw someone he recognised in the distance and hurried along to say hello it would turn out to be someone else with an altogether neater hairstyle and a much more thrusting purposeful look than well than anybody ford knew a staircase had been moved a few inches to the left a ceiling had been lowered slightly a lobby had been remodelled all these things were not worrying in themselves though they were a little disorienting the thing that was worrying was the decor it used to be brash and glitzy expensive ʹ because the g uide sold so well through the civilised and post ­‐civilised galaxy ʹ but expensive and fun wild games machines lined the corridors insanely painted grand pianos hung from ceilings vicious sea creatures from the planet viv reared up out of pools in tree ­‐filled atria robot butlers in stupid shirts roamed the corridors seeking whose hands they might press frothing drinks into people used to have pet vastdragons on leads and pterospondes on perches in their offices people knew how to have a good time and if they didnt there were courses they could sign up for which would put that right there was none of that now somebody had been through the place doing some iniquitous kind of taste job on it ford turned sharply into a small alcove cupped his hand and yanked the flying robot in with him he squatted down and peered at the burbling cybernaut whats been happening here he demanded oh just the nicest things sir just the nicest possible things can i sit on your lap please no said ford brushing the thing away it was overjoyed to be spurned in this way and started to bob and burble and swoon ford grabbed it again and stuck it firmly in the air a foot in front of his face it tried to stay where it was put but couldnt help quivering sl ightly somethings changed hasnt it ford hissed oh yes squealed the little robot in the most fabulous and wonderful way i feel so good about it well what was it like before then scrumptious but you like the way its changed de manded ford i like everything moaned the robot especially when you shout at me like that do it again please just tell me whats happened oh thank you thank you ford sighed ok ok panted the robot the guide has been taken over theres a new management its all so gorgeous i could just melt the old management was also fabulous of course though im not sure if i thought so at the time that was before you had a bit of wire stuck in your head how true how wonderfully true how wonderfully bubblingly frothingly burstingly true what a truly ecstasy ­‐inducingly correct observation whats happened insisted ford who is this new management when did they take over i oh never mind he added as the little robot s tarted to gibbet with uncontrollable joy and rub itself against his knee ill go and find out for myself ford hurled himself at the door of the editor ­‐in­‐chiefs office tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave way rolled rapi dly across the floor to where the drinks trolley laden with some of the galaxys most potent and expensive beverages habitually stood seized hold of the trolley and using it to give himself cover trundled it and himself across the main exposed part of t he office floor to where the valuable and extremely rude statue of leda and the octopus stood and took shelter behind it meanwhile the little security robot entering at chest height was suicidally delighted to draw gunfire away from ford that at lea st was the plan and a necessary one the current editor ­‐in­‐chief stagyar ­‐zil­‐doggo was a dangerously unbalanced man who took a homicidal view of contributing staff turning up in his office without pages of fresh proofed copy and had a battery of lase r guided guns linked to special scanning devices in the door frame to deter anybody who was merely bringing extremely good reasons why they hadnt written any thus was a high level of output maintained unfortunately the drinks trolley wasnt there ford hurled himself desperately sideways and somersaulted towards the statue of leda and the octopus which also wasnt there he rolled and hurtled around the room in a kind of random panic tripped span hit the window which fortunately was built to withstand rocket attacks rebounded and fell in a bruised and winded heap behind a smart grey crushed leather sofa which hadnt been there before after a few seconds he slowly peeked up above the top of the sofa as well as there being no drinks trolley and no leda and the octopus there had also been a startling absence of gunfire he frowned this was all utterly wrong mr prefect i assume said a voice the voice came from a smooth ­‐faced individual behind a large ceramo ­‐teak­‐bonded desk stagyar ­‐zil­‐doggo may well have been a hell of an individual but no one for a whole variety of reasons would ever have called him smooth ­‐faced this was not stagyar ­‐zil­‐doggo i assume from the manner of your entrance that you do not have new material for the er guide at the moment said the smooth ­‐ faced individual he was sitting with his elbows resting on the table and holding his fingertips together in a manner which inexplicably has never been made a capital offence ive been busy said ford rat her weakly he staggered to his feet brushing himself down then he thought what the hell was he saying things weakly for he had to get on top of this situation he had to find out who the hell this person was and he suddenly thought of a way of doing it who the hell are you he demanded i am your new editor ­‐in­‐chief that is if we decide to retain your services my name is vann harl he didnt put his hand out he just added what have you done to that security robot the little robot was rolling very very slowly round the ceiling and moaning quietly to itself ive made it very happy snapped ford its a kind of mission i have wheres stagyar more to the point wheres his drinks trolley mr zil ­‐doggo is no longer with this org anisation his drinks trolley is i imagine helping to console him for this fact organisation yelled ford organisation what a bloody stupid word for a set ­‐up like this precisely our sentiments under ­‐structured overresourced under ­‐managed over ­‐inebriated and that said harl was just the editor ill do the jokes snarled ford no said harl you will do the restaurant column he tossed a piece of plasti c on to the desk in front of him ford did not move to pick it up you what said ford no me harl you prefect you do restaurant column me editor me sit here tell you do restaurant column you get restaurant column said ford too bewildered to be really angry yet siddown prefect said harl he swung round in his swivel chair got to his feet and stood staring out at the tiny specks enjoying the carnival twenty ­‐three stories below time to get this business on its feet prefect he s napped we at infinidim enterprises are you at what infinidim enterprises we have bought out the guide infinidim we spent millions on that name prefect start liking it or start packing ford shrugged he had nothing to pack the galaxy is changing said harl weve got to change with it go with the market the market is moving up new aspirations new technology the future is dont tell me about the future said ford ive been all over the future spend half my time t here its the same as anywhere else anywhen else whatever just the same old stuff in faster cars and smellier air thats one future said harl thats your future if you accept it youve got to learn to think multi ­‐dimensionally there are limitless futures stretching out in every direction from this moment ­‐and from this moment and from this billions of them bi furcating every instant every possible position of every possible electron balloons out into billions of probabilities billions and billions of shining gleaming futures you know what that means youre dribbling down your chin billions and billi ons of markets i see said ford so you sell billions and billions of guides no said harl reaching for his handkerchief and not finding one excuse me he said but this gets me so excited ford handed him his towel the reason we dont sell billions and billions of guides continued harl after wiping his mouth is the expense what we do is we sell one guide billions and billions of times we exploit the multidimensional nature of the universe to cut down on manufacturing costs and w e dont sell to penniless hitchhikers what a stupid notion that was find the one section of the market that more or less by definition doesnt have any money and try and sell to it no we sell to the affluent business traveller and his vacationing wife in a billion billion different futures this is the most radical dynamic and thrusting business venture in the entire multidimensional infinity of spacetimeprobability ever and you want me to be its restaurant critic said ford we would valu e your input kill shouted ford he shouted it at his towel the towel leapt up out of harls hands this was not because it had any motive force of its own but because harl was so startled at the idea that it might the next thing that startled hi m was the sight of ford prefect hurtling across the desk at him fists first in fact ford was just lunging for the credit card but you dont get to occupy the sort of position that harl occupied in the sort of organisation in which harl occupied it withou t developing a healthily paranoid view of life he took the sensible precaution of hurling himself backwards and striking his head a sharp blow on the rocket ­‐proof glass then subsided into a series of worrying and highly personal dreams ford lay on the desk su rprised at how swimmingly every thing had gone he glanced quickly at the piece of plastic he now held in his hand ʹ it was a dine ­‐o­‐charge credit card with his name already embossed on it and an expiry date two years from now and was possibly th e single most exciting thing ford had ever seen in his life ʹ then he clambered over the desk to see to harl he was breathing fairly easily it occurred to ford that he might breathe more easily yet without the weight of his wallet bearing down on his ch est so he slipped it out of harls breast pocket and flipped through it fair amount of cash credit tokens ultragolf club membership other club memberships photos of someones wife and family ʹ presumably harls but it was hard to be sure these days busy executives often didnt have time for a full ­‐time wife and family and would just rent them for weekends ha he couldnt believe what hed just found he slowly drew out from the wallet a single and insanely exciting piece of plastic that was nest ling amongst a bunch of receipts it wasnt insanely exciting to look at it was rather dull in fact it was smaller and a little thicker than a credit card and semi ­‐ transparent if you held it up to the light you could see a lot of holographically encode d information and images buried pseudo ­‐ inches deep beneath its surface it was an ident ­‐i­‐eeze and was a very naughty and silly thing for harl to have lying around in his wallet though it was perfectly understandable there were so many different ways i n which you were required to provide absolute proof of your identity these days that life could easily become extremely tiresome just from that factor alone never mind the deeper existential problems of trying to function as a coherent consciousness in an epistemologically ambiguous physical universe just look at cash point machines for instance queues of people standing around waiting to have their fingerprints read their retinas scanned bits of skin scraped from the nape of the neck and undergoing i nstant or nearly instant ʹ a good six or seven seconds in tedious reality genetic analysis then having to answer trick questions about members of their family they didnt even remember they had and about their recorded preferences for tablecloth colour s and that was just to get a bit of spare cash for the weekend if you were trying to raise a loan for a jetcar sign a missile treaty or pay an entire restaurant bill things could get really trying hence the ident ­‐i­‐eeze this encoded every single piec e of information about you your body and your life into one all ­‐purpose machine ­‐readable card that you could then carry around in your wallet and therefore represented technologys greatest triumph to date over both itself and plain common sense ford p ocketed it a remarkably good idea had just occurred to him he wondered how long harl would remain unconscious hey he shouted to the little melon ­‐sized robot still slobbering with euphoria up on the ceiling you want to stay happy the robot gurgled that it did then stick with me and do everything i tell you without fail the robot said that it was quite happy where it was up on the ceiling thank you very much it had never realised before how much sheer titillation there was to be got from a good ceiling and it wanted to explore its feelings about ceilings in greater depth you stay there said ford and youll soon be recaptured and have your conditional chip replaced you want to stay happy come now the robot let out a long heartfelt sigh of impassioned tristesse and sank reluctantly away from the ceiling listen said ford can you keep the rest of the security system happy for a few minutes one of the joys of true happiness trilled the robot is sharing i brim i froth i overflow with ok said ford just spread a little happiness around the security network dont give it any information just make it feel good so it doesnt feel the need to ask for any he picked up his towel and ran cheerfully for the door life had been a little dull of late it showed every sign now of becoming extremely froody chapter arthur dent had been in some hell ­‐holes in his life but he had never before seen a spacepo rt which had a sign saying even travelling despondently is better than arriving here to welcome visitors the arrivals hall featured a picture of the president of nowwhat smiling it was the only picture anybody could find of him and it had been taken shortly after he had shot himself so although the photo had been retouched as well as could be managed the smile it wore was rather a ghastly one the side of his head had been drawn back in crayon no replacement had been found for the photograph because no replacement had been found for the president there was only one ambition which anyone on the planet ever had and that was to leave arthur checked himself into a small motel on the outskirts of town and sat glumly on the bed which was damp and fl ipped through the little information brochure which was also damp it said that the planet of nowwhat had been named after the opening words of the first settlers to arrive there after struggling across light years of space to reach the furthest unexplore d outreaches of the galaxy the main town was called ohwell there werent any other towns to speak of settlement on nowwhat had not been a success and the sort of people who actually wanted to live on nowwhat were not the sort of people you would want to spend time with trading was mentioned in the brochure the main trade that was carried out was in the skins of the nowwhattian boghog but it wasnt a very successful one because no one in their right minds would want to buy a nowwhattian boghog skin th e trade only hung on by its fingernails because there was always a significant number of people in the galaxy who were not in their right minds arthur had felt very uncomfortable looking around at some of the other occupants of the small passenger compart ment of the ship the brochure described some of the history of the planet whoever had written it had obviously started out trying to drum up a little enthusiasm for the place by stressing that it wasnt actually cold and wet all the time but could find little positive to add to this so the tone of the piece quickly degenerated into savage irony it talked about the early years of settlement it said that the major activities pursued on nowwhat were those of catching skinning and eating nowwhattian bog hogs which were the only extant form of animal life on nowwhat all other having long ago died of despair the boghogs were tiny vicious creatures and the small margin by which they fell short of being completely inedible was the margin by which life on the planet subsisted so what were the rewards however small that made life on nowwhat worth living well there werent any not a one even making yourself some protective clothing out of boghog skins was an exercise in disappointment and futility si nce the skins were unaccountably thin and leaky this caused a lot of puzzled conjecture amongst the settlers what was the boghogs secret of keeping warm if anyone had ever learnt the language the boghogs spoke to each other they would have discovered t hat there was no trick the boghogs were as cold and wet as anyone else on the planet no one had had the slightest desire to learn the language of the boghogs for the simple reason that these creatures communicated by biting each other very hard on the th igh life on nowwhat being what it was most of what a boghog might have to say about it could easily be signified by these means arthur flipped through the brochure till he found what he was looking for at the back there were a few maps of the planet they were fairly rough and ready because they werent likely to be of much interest to anyone but they told him what he wanted to know he didnt recognise it at first because the maps were the other way up from the way he would have expected and looked therefore thoroughly unfamiliar of course up and down north and south are absolutely arbitrary designations but we are used to seeing things the way we are used to seeing them and arthur had to turn the maps upside ­‐down to make sense of them there was one huge landmass off on the upper left ­‐hand side of the page which tapered down to a tiny waist and then ballooned out again like a large comma on the right ­‐hand side was a collection of large shapes jumbled familiarly together the outlines were no t exactly the same and arthur didnt know if this was because the map was so rough or because the sea ­‐level was higher or because well things were just different here but the evidence was inarguable this was definitely the earth or rather it most definitely was not it merely looked a lot like the earth and occupied the same coordinates in spacetime what co ­‐ordinates it occupied in probability was anybodys guess he sighed this he realised was about as close to home as he was likely to ge t which meant that he was about as far from home as he could possibly be glumly he slapped the brochure shut and wondered what on earth he was going to do next he allowed himself a hollow laugh at what he had just thought he looked at his old watch a nd shook it a bit to wind it it had taken him according to his own time ­‐scale a year of hard travelling to get here a year since the accident in hyperspace in which fenchurch had completely vanished one minute she had been sitting there next to him in the slumpjet the next minute the ship had done a perfectly normal hyperspace hop and when he had next looked she was not there the seat wasnt even warm her name wasnt even on the passenger list the spaceline had been wary of him when he had complai ned a lot of awkward things happen in space travel and a lot of them make a lot of money for lawyers but when they had asked him what galactic sector he and fenchurch had been from and he had said zz plural z alpha they had relaxed completely in a way that arthur wasnt at all sure he liked they even laughed a little though sympathetically of course they pointed to the clause in the ticket contract which said that the entities whose lifespans had originated in any of the plural zones were advised no t to travel in hyperspace and did so at their own risk every ­‐body they said knew that they tittered slightly and shook their heads as arthur had left their offices he found he was trembling slightly not only had he lost fenchurch in the most complet e and utter way possible but he felt that the more time he spent away out in the galaxy the more it seemed that the number of things he didnt know anything about actually increased just as he was lost for a moment in these numb memories a knock came on the door of his motel room which then opened immediately a fat and dishevelled man came in carrying arthurs one small case he got as far as where shall i put ʹ when there was a sudden violent flurry and he collapsed heavily against the door tryi ng to beat off a small and mangy creature that had leapt snarling out of the wet night and buried its teeth in his thigh even through the thick layers of leather padding he wore there there was a brief ugly confusion of jabbering and thrashing the man shouted frantically and pointed arthur grabbed a hefty stick that stood next to the door expressly for this purpose and beat at the boghog with it the boghog suddenly disengaged and limped backwards dazed and forlorn it turned anxiously in the corner of the room its tail tucked up right under its back legs and stood looking nervously up at arthur jerking its head awkwardly and repeatedly to one side its jaw seemed to be dislocated it cried a little and scraped its damp tail across the floor by th e door the fat man with arthurs suitcase was sitting and cursing trying to staunch the flow of blood from his thigh his clothes were already wet from the rain arthur stared at the boghog not knowing what to do the boghog looked at him questioningly it tried to approach him waking mournful little whimpering noises it moved its jaw pain ­‐fully it made a sudden leap for arthurs thigh but its dislocated jaw was too weak to get a grip and it sank whining sadly down to the floor the fat man jumped to his feet grabbed the stick beat the boghogs brains into a sticky pulpy mess on the thin carpet and then stood there breathing heavily as if daring the animal to move again just once a single boghog eyeball sat looking reproachfully at arthur from out of the mashed ruins of its head what do you think it was trying to say asked arthur in a small voice ah nothing much said the man just its way of trying to be friendly this i s just our way of being friendly back he added gripping the stick whens the next flight out asked arthur thought youd only just arrived said the man yes said arthur it was only going to be a brief visit i just wanted to see if this was the right place or not sorry you mean youre on the wrong planet said the man lugubriously funny how many people say that specially the people who live here he eyed the remains of the boghog with a deep ancestral resentment oh no said arthur its the right planet all right he picked up the damp brochure lying on the bed and put it in his pocket its ok thanks ill take that he said takin g his case from the man he went to the door and looked out into the cold wet night yes its the right planet all right he said again right planet wrong universe a single bird wheeled in the sky above him as he set off back for the spaceport chapter ford had his own code of ethics it wasnt much of one but it was his and he stuck by it more or less one rule he made was never to buy his own drinks he wasnt sure if that counted as an ethic but you have to go with what youve got he was also firmly and utterly opposed to all and any forms of cruelty to any animals whatsoever except geese and furthermore he would never steal from his employers well not exactly steal if his accounts supervisor didnt start to hyperventilate a nd put out a seal ­‐all­‐exits security alert when ford handed in his expenses claim then ford felt he wasnt doing his job properly but actually stealing was another thing that was biting the hand that feeds you sucking very hard on it even nibbling it i n an affectionate kind of a way was ok but you didnt actually bite it not when that hand was the guide the guide was something sacred and special but that thought ford as he ducked and weaved his way down through the building was about to change a nd they had only themselves to blame look at all this stuff lines of neat grey office cubicles and executive workstation pods the whole place was dreary with the hum of memos and minutes of meetings flitting through its electronic networks out in the s treet they were playing hunt the wocket for zarks sake but here in the very heart of the guide offices no one was even recklessly kicking a ball around the corridors or wearing inappropriately coloured beachware infinidim enterprises ford snarled to himself as he stalked rapidly down one corridor after another door after door magically opened to him without question elevators took him happily to places they should not ford was trying to pursue the most tangled and complicated route he could headi ng generally down ­‐wards through the building his happy little robot took care of everything spreading waves of acquiescent joy through all the security circuits it encountered ford thought it needed a name and decided to call it emily saunders after a girl he had very fond memories of then he thought that emily saunders was an absurd name for a security robot and decided to call it colin instead after emilys dog he was moving deep into the bowels of the building now into areas he had never enter ed before areas of higher and higher security he was beginning to encounter puzzled looks from the operatives he passed at this level of security you didnt even call them people anymore and they were probably doing stuff that only operatives would do when they went home to their families in the evening they became people again and when their little children looked up to them with their sweet shining eyes and said daddy what did you do all day today they just said i performed my duties as an ope rative and left it at that the truth of the matter was that all sorts of highly dodgy stuff went on behind the cheery happy ­‐go­‐lucky front that the guide liked to put up ʹ or used to like to put up before this new infinidim enterprises bunch marched i n and started to make the whole thing highly dodgy there were all kinds of tax scams and rackets and graft and shady deals supporting the shining edifice and down in the secure research and data ­‐processing levels of the building was where it all went on every few years the guide would set up its business and indeed its building on a new world and all would be sunshine and laughter for a while as the guide would put down its roots in the local culture and economy provide employment a sense of glamour and adventure and in the end not quite as much actual revenue as the locals had expected when the guide moved on taking its building with it it left a little like a thief in the night exactly like a thief in the night in fact it usually left in th e very early hours of the morning and the following day there always turned out to be a very great deal of stuff missing whole cultures and economies would collapse in its wake often within a week leaving once thriving planets desolate and shell ­‐ shocke d but still somehow feeling they had been part of some great adventure the operatives who shot puzzled glances at ford as he marched on into the depths of the buildings most sensitive areas were reassured by the presence of colin who was flying along with him in a buzz of emotional fulfilment and easing his path for him at every stage alarms were starting to go off in other parts of the building perhaps that meant that vann harl had already been discovered which might be a problem ford had been hoping he would be able to slip the ident ­‐i­‐eeze back into his pocket before he came round well that was a problem for later and he didnt for the moment have the faintest idea how he was going to solve it for the moment he wasnt going to worry wherever he went with little colin he was surrounded by a cocoon of sweetness and light and m ost importantly willing and acquiescent elevators and positively obsequious doors ford even began to whistle which was probably his mistake nobody likes a whistler particularly not the divinity that shapes our ends the next door wouldnt open and that was a pity because it was the very one that ford had been making for it stood there before him grey and resolutely closed with a sign on it saying no admittance not even to authorised personnel you are wasting your time here go away colin reported that the doors had been getting generally a lot grimmer down in these lower reaches of the building they were about ten stories below ground level now the air was refrigerated and the tasteful grey hessian wall ­‐weave had given way to brutal grey bolted steel walls colins rampant euphoria had subsided into a kind of determined cheeriness he said that he was beginning to tire a little it was taking all his energy to pump the slightest bonhomie whatsoever into the doors down here ford kick ed at the door it opened mixture of pleasure and pain he muttered always does the trick he walked in and colin flew in after him even with a wire stuck straight into his pleasure electrode his happiness was a nervous kind of happiness he bobbe d around a little the room was small grey and humming this was the nerve centre of the entire guide the computer terminals that lined the grey walls were windows on to every aspect of the guides operations here on the left ­‐hand side of the room reports were gathered over the sub ­‐etha ­‐net from field researchers in every corner of the galaxy fed straight up into the network of sub ­‐editors offices where they had all the good bits cut out by secretaries because the sub ­‐editors were out having lunch the remaining copy would then be shot across to the other half of the building ʹ the other leg of the h ʹ which was the legal department the legal department would cut out anything that was still even remotely good from what remained and fire it back to the offices of the executive editors who were also out at lunch so the editors secretaries would read it and say it was stupid and cut most of what was left when any of the editors finally staggered in from lunch they would exclaim what is this fee ble crap that x ʹ where x was the name of the field researcher in question ʹ has sent us from half ­‐way across the bloody galaxy whats the point of having somebody spending three whole orbital periods out in the bloody gagrakacka mind zones with all th at stuff going on out there if this load of anaemic squitter is the best he can be bothered to send us disallow his expenses what shall we do with the copy the secretary would ask ah put it out over the network got to have something going out there ive got a headache im going home so the edited copy would go for one last slash and burn through the legal department and then be sent back down here where it would be broadcast out over the sub ­‐etha ­‐net for instantaneous retrieval anywhere i n the galaxy that was handled by equipment which was monitored and controlled by the terminals on the right ­‐ hand side of the room meanwhile the order to disallow the researchers expenses was relayed down to the computer terminal stuck off in the right ­‐hand corner and it was to this terminal that ford prefect now swiftly made his way if you are reading this on planet earth then a good luck to you there is an awful lot of stuff you dont know anything about but you are not alone in this its jus t that in your case the consequences of not knowing any of this stuff are particularly terrible but then hey thats just the way the cookie gets completely stomped on and obliterated b dont imagine you know what a computer terminal is a computer t erminal is not some clunky old television with a typewriter in front of it it is an interface where the mind and body can connect with the universe and move bits of it about ford hurried over to the terminal sat in front of it and quickly dipped himse lf into its universe it wasnt the normal universe he knew it was a universe of densely enfolded worlds of wild topographies towering mountain peaks heart stopping ravines of moons shattering off into sea horses hurtful blurting crevices silently heaving oceans and bottomless hurtling hooping funts he held still to get his bearings he controlled his breathing closed his eyes and looked again so this was where accountants spent their time there was clearly more to them than met the eye he looked around carefully trying not to let it all swell and swim and overwhelm him he didnt know his way around this universe he didnt even know the ph ysical laws that determined its dimensional extents or behaviours but his instinct told him to look for the most outstanding feature he could detect and make towards it way off in some indistinguishable distance ʹ was it a mile or a million or a mote in his eye ʹ was a stunning peak that overarched the sky climbed and climbed and spread out in flowering aigrettes agglomerates and arch imandrites he weltered towards it hooling and thurling and at last reached it in a meaninglessly long umthingt h of time he clung to it arms outspread gripping tightly on to its roughly gnarled and pitted surface once he was certain that he was secure he made the hideous mistake of looking down while he had been weltering hooling and thurling the distance beneath him had not bothered him unduly but now that he was gripping the distance made his heart wilt and his brain bend his fingers were white with pain and tension his teeth were grinding and twisting against each other beyond his control his eyes t urned inwards with waves from the willowing extremities of nausea with an immense effort of will and faith he simply let go and pushed he felt himself float away and then counter ­‐intuitively upwards and upwards he threw his shoulders back let h is arms drop gazed upwards and let himself be drawn loosely higher and higher before long insofar as such terms had any meaning in this virtual universe a ledge loomed up ahead of him on which he could grip and on to which he could clamber he rose he gripped he clambered he panted a little this was all a little stressful he held tightly on to the ledge as he sat he wasnt certain if this was to prevent himself from falling down off it or rising up from it but he needed something to grip on to as he surveyed the world in which he found himself the whirling turning height span him and twisted his brain in upon itself till he found himself eyes closed whimpering and hugging the hideous wall of towering rock he slowly brought his breathin g back under control again he told himself repeatedly that he was just in a graphic representation of a world a virtual universe a simulated reality he could snap back out of it at any moment he snapped back out of it he was sitting in a blue leath erette foam filled swivel ­‐seated office chair in front of a computer terminal he relaxed he was clinging to the face of an impossibly high peak perched on a narrow ledge above a drop of brain ­‐swivelling dimensions it wasnt just the landscape being s o far beneath him ʹ he wished it would stop undulating and waving he had to get a grip not on the rock wall ʹ that was an illusion he had to get a grip on the situation be able to look at the physical world he was in while drawing himself out of it em otionally he clenched inwardly and then just as he had let go of the rock face itself he let go of the idea of the rock face and let himself just sit there clearly and freely he looked out at the world he was breathing well he was cool he was in ch arge again he was in a four ­‐dimensional topological model of the guides financial systems and somebody or something would very shortly want to know why and here they came swooping through virtual space towards him came a small flock of mean and steely ­‐eyed creatures with pointy little heads pencil moustaches and querulous demands as to who he was what he was doing there what his authorisation was what the authorisation of his authorising agent was what his inside leg measurement was and so on laser light flickered all over him as if he was a packet of biscuits at a supermarket check ­‐out the heavier duty laser guns were held for the moment in reserve the fact that a ll of this was happening in virtual space made no difference being virtually killed by a virtual laser in virtual space is just as effective as the real thing because you are as dead as you think you are the laser readers were becoming very agitated as they flickered over his fingerprints his retina and the follicle pattern where his hair line was receding they didnt like what they were finding at all the chattering and screeching of highly personal and insolent questions was rising in pitch a litt le surgical steel scraper was reaching out towards the skin at the nape of his neck when ford holding his breath and praying very slightly pulled vann harls ident ­‐i­‐eeze out of his pocket and waved it in front of them instantly every laser was diverte d to the little card and swept backwards and forwards over it and in it examining and reading every molecule then just as suddenly they stopped the entire flock of little virtual inspectors snapped to attention nice to see you mr harl they said in smarmy unison is there anything we can do for you ford smiled a slow and vicious smile do you know he said i rather think there is five minutes later he was out of there about thirty seconds to do the job and three minutes thirty to cover his tracks he could have done anything he liked in the virtual structure more or less he could have transferred ownership of the entire organisation into his own name but he doubted if that would have gone unn oticed he didnt want it anyway it would have meant responsibility working late nights at the office not to mention massive and time ­‐consuming fraud investigations and a fair amount of time in jail he wanted something that nobody other than the comput er would notice that was the bit that took thirty seconds the thing that took three minutes thirty was programming the computer not to notice that it had noticed anything it had to want not to know about what ford was up to and then he could safely l eave the computer to rationalise its own defences against the information ever emerging it was a programming technique that had been reverse ­‐engineered from the sort of psychotic mental blocks that otherwise perfectly normal people had been observed invar iably to develop when elected to high political office the other minute was spent discovering that the computer system already had a mental block a big one he would never have discovered it if he hadnt been busy engineering a mental block himself he came across a whole slew of smooth and plausible denial procedures and diversionary subroutines exactly where he had been planning to install his own the computer denied all knowledge of them of course then blankly refused to accept that there was anyt hing even to deny knowledge of and was generally so convincing that even ford almost found himself thinking he must have made a mistake he was impressed he was so impressed in fact that he didnt bother to install his own mental block procedures he just set up calls to the ones that were already there which then called themselves when questioned and so on he quickly set about debugging the little bits of code he had installed himself only to discover they werent there cursing he searched all over for them but could find no trace of them at all he was just about to start installing them all over again when he realised that the reason he couldnt find them was that they were working already he grinned with satisfaction he tried to discov er what the computers other mental block was all about but it seemed not unnaturally to have a mental block about it he could no longer find any trace of it at all in fact it was that good he wondered if he had been imagining it he wondered if he had been imagining that it was something to do with something in the building and something to do with the number he ran a few tests yes he had obviously been imagining it no time for fancy routes now there was obviously a major security alert i n progress ford took the elevator up to the ground floor to change to the express elevators he had somehow to get the ident ­‐i­‐ eeze back into harls pocket before it was missed how he didnt know the doors of the elevator slid open to reveal a large p osse of security guards and robots poised waiting for it and brandishing filthy looking weapons they ordered him out with a shrug he stepped forward they all pushed rudely past him into the elevator which took them down to continue their search for him on the lower levels this was fun thought ford giving colin a friendly pat colin was about the first genuinely useful robot ford had ever encountered colin bobbed along in the air in front of him in a lather of cheerful ecstasy ford was glad hed n amed him after a dog he was highly tempted just to leave at that point and hope for the best but he knew that the best had a far greater chance of actually occurring if harl did not discover that his ident ­‐i­‐eeze was missing he had somehow surreptitio usly to return it they went to the express elevators hi said the elevator they got into hi said ford where can i take you folks today said the elevator floor said ford seems to be a popular floor today said the elevator hmm thought ford not liking the sound of that at all the elevator lit up the twenty ­‐third floor on its floor display and started to zoom upwards something about the floor display tweaked at fords mind but he couldnt catch what it was and forgot abo ut it he was more worried about the idea of the floor he was going to being a popular one he hadnt really thought through how he was going to deal with whatever it was that was happening up there because he had no idea what he was going to find he woul d just have to busk it they were there the doors slid open ominous quiet empty corridor there was the door to harls office with a slight layer of dust around it ford knew that this dust consisted of billions of tiny molecular robots that had c rawled out of the woodwork built each other rebuilt the door disassembled each other and then crept back into the woodwork again and just waited for damage ford wondered what kind of life that was but not for long because he was a lot more concerned a bout what his own life was like at that moment he took a deep breath and started his run chapter arthur felt at a bit of a loss there was a whole galaxy of stuff out there for him and he wondered if it was churlish of him to complain to himself that it lacked just two things the world he was born on and the woman he loved damn it and blast it he thought and felt the need of some guidance and advice he consulted the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy he looked up guidance and it said see under advice he looked up advice and it said see under guidance it had been doing a lot of that kind of stuff recently and he wondered if it was all it was cracked up to be he headed to the outer eastern rim of the galaxy where it was said wisdom and truth were to be found most particularly on the planet hawalius which was a planet of oracles and s eers and soothsayers and also take ­‐away pizza shops because most mystics were completely incapable of cooking for themselves however it appeared that some sort of calamity had befallen this planet as arthur wandered the streets of the village where the major prophets lived it had something of a crestfallen air he came across one prophet who was clearly shutting up shop in a despondent kind of way and asked him what was happening no call for us any more he said gruffly as he started to bang a nail into the plank he was holding across the window of his hovel oh whys that hold on to the other end of this and ill show you arthur held up the unnailed end of the plank and the old prophet scuttled into the recesses of his hovel returning a moment or two later with a small sub ­‐etha radio he turned it on fiddled with the dial for a moment and put the thing on the small wooden bench that he usually sat and prophesied on he then took hold of the plank again and resumed hammering arthur sat and listened to the radio be confirmed said the radio tomorrow it continued the vice ­‐president of poffla vigus roopy ga stip will announce that he intends to run for president in a speech he will give tomorrow at find another channe l said the prophet arthur pushed the preset button refused to comment said the radio next weeks jobless totals in the zabush sector it continued will be the worst since records began a report published next month says find another barked the prophet crossly arthur pushed the button again denied it categorically said the radio next months royal wedding between prince gid of the soofling dynasty and princess hooli of raui alpha will be the most spectacular ceremony the bjanjy territories has ever witnessed our reporter trillian astra is there and sends us this report arthur blinked the sound of cheering crowds and a hubbub of brass bands erupted from the radio a very familiar voice said well krart the scene here in the middle of next month is absolutely incredible princess hooli is looking radiant in a the prophet swiped the radio off the bench and on to the dusty ground where it squawked like a badly tuned chicken see what we have to con tend with grumbled the prophet here hold this not that this no not like that this way up other way round you fool i was listening to that complained arthur grappling helplessly with the prophets hammer so does everybody thats why t his place is like a ghost town he spat into the dust no i mean that sounded like someone i knew princess hooli if i had to stand around saying hello to everybody whos known princess hooli id need a new set of lungs not the princess said arthur the reporter her names trillian i dont know where she got the astra from shes from the same planet as me i wondered where shed got to oh shes all over the continuum these days we cant get the tri ­‐d tv stations out here of course thank the great green arkleseizure but you hear her on the radio gallivanting here and there through spacetime she wants to settle down and find herself a steady era that young lady does itll all end in tears probably already has he swung with his hammer and hit his thumb rather hard he started to speak in tongues the village of oracles wasnt much better he had been told that when looking for a good oracle it was best to find the oracle that other oracles went to but he was shut there was a sign by the entrance saying i just dont know any more try next door r but thats just a suggestion not formal oracular advice next door was a cave a few hundred yards away and arthur walked towards it smoke and steam were rising from respe ctively a small fire and a battered tin pot that was hanging over it there was also a very nasty smell coming from the pot at least arthur thought it was coming from the pot the distended bladders of some of the local goat ­‐like things were hanging from a propped ­‐up line drying in the sun and the smell could have been coming from them there was also a worryingly small distance away a pile of discarded bodies of the local goat ­‐like things and the smell could have been coming from them but the smell could just as easily have been coming from the old lady who was busy beating flies away from the pile of bodies it was a hopeless task because each of the flies was about the size of a winged bottle top and all she had was a table tennis bat also she see med half blind every now and then by chance her wild thrashing would connect with one of the flies with a richly satisfying thunk and the fly would hurtle through the air and smack itself open against the rock face a few yards from the entrance to her cave she gave every impression by her demeanour that these were the moments she lived for arthur watched this exotic performance for a while from a polite distance and then at last tried giving a gentle cough to attract her attention the gentle cou gh courteously meant unfortunately involved first inhaling rather more of the local atmosphere than he had so far been doing and as a result he erupted into a fit of raucous expectoration and collapsed against the rock face choking and streaming with tears he struggled for breath but each new breath made things worse he vomited half ­‐choked again rolled over his vomit kept rolling for a few yards and eventually made it up on to his hands and knees and crawled panting into slightly fresher air excuse me he said he got some breath back i really am most dreadfully sorry i feel a complete idiot and he gestured helplessly towards the small pile of his own vomit lying spread around the entrance to her cave what can i say he said wh at can i possibly say this at least had gained her attention she looked round at him suspiciously but being half blind had difficulty finding him in the blurred and rocky landscape he waved helpfully hello he called at last she spotted him grunted to herself and turned back to whacking flies it was horribly apparent from the way that currents of air moved when she did that the major source of the smell was in fact her the drying bladders the festering bodies and the noxious potage may all have been making violent contributions to the atmosphere but the major olfactory presence was the woman herself she got another good thwack at a fly it smacked against the rock and dribbled its insides down it in what she clearly regarded if she could see that far as a satisfactory manner unsteadily arthur got to his feet and brushed himself down with a fistful of dried grass he didnt know what else to do by way of announcing himself he had half a mind just to wander off again but felt awkw ard about leaving a pile of his vomit in front of the entrance to the womans home he wondered what to do about it he started to pluck up more handsful of the scrubby dried grass that was to be found here and there he was worried though that if he ven tured nearer to the vomit he might simply add to it rather than clear it up just as he was debating with himself as to what the right course of action was he began to realise that she was at last saying something to him i beg your pardon he called out i said can i help you she said in a thin scratchy voice that he could only just hear er i came to ask your advice he called back feeling a bit ridiculous she turned to peer at him myopically then turned back swiped at a fly and missed what about she said i beg your pardon he said i said what about she almost screeched well said arthur just sort of general advice really it said in the brochure ʹ ha brochure spat the old woman she seemed to be waving her bat more or less at random now arthur fished the crumpled ­‐up brochure from his pocket he wasnt quite certain why he had already read it and she he expected wouldnt w ant to he unfolded it anyway in order to have something to frown thoughtfully at for a moment or two the copy in the brochure wittered on about the ancient mystical arts of the seers and sages of hawalius and wildly over ­‐represented the level of accommo dation available in hawalion arthur still carried a copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy with him but found when he consulted it that the entries were becoming more abstruse and paranoid and had lots of xs and js and s in them something was wrong somewhere whether it was in his own personal unit or whether it was something or someone going terribly amiss or perhaps just hallucinating at the heart of the guide organisation itself he didnt know but one way or another he was even less inc lined to trust it than usual which meant that he trusted it not one bit and mostly used it for eating his sandwiches off when he was sitting on a rock staring at something the woman had turned and was walking slowly towards him now arthur tried witho ut making it too obvious to judge the wind direction and bobbed about a bit as she approached advice she said advice eh er yes said arthur yes that is ʹ he frowned again at the brochure as if to be certain that he hadnt misread it and stupidly turned up on the wrong planet or something the brochure said the friendly local inhabitants will be glad to share with you the knowledge and wisdom of the ancients peer with them into the swirling mysteries of past and future time there w ere some coupons as well but arthur had been far too embarrassed actually to cut them out or try to present them to anybody advice eh said the old woman again just sort of general advice you say on what what to do with your life that sort of t hing yes said arthur that sort of thing bit of a problem i sometimes find if im being perfectly honest he was trying desperately with tiny darting movements to stay upwind of her she surprised him by suddenly turning sharply away from him an d heading off towards her cave youll have to help me with the photocopier then she said what said arthur the photocopier she repeated patiently youll have to help me drag it out its solar ­‐powered i have to keep it in the cave thoug h so the birds dont shit on it i see said arthur id take a few deep breaths if i were you muttered the old woman as she stomped into the gloom of the cave mouth arthur did as she advised he almost hyperventilated in fact when he felt he was ready he held his breath and followed her in the photocopier was a big old thing on a rickety trolley it stood just inside the dim shadows of the cave the wheels were stuck obstinately in different directions and the ground was rough and stony go ahead and take a breath outside said the old woman arthur was going red in the face trying to help her move the thing he nodded in relief if she wasnt going to be embarrassed about it then neither he was determined would he he stepped outside and took a few breaths then came back in to do more heaving and pushing he had to do this quite a few times till at last the machine was outside the sun beat down on it the old woman disappeared back into her cave again and brought with her some mottl ed metal panels which she connected to the machine to collect the suns energy she squinted up into the sky the sun was quite bright but the day was hazy and vague itll take a while she said arthur said he was happy to wait the old woman shrugged and stomped across to the fire above it the contents of the tin can were bubbling away she poked about at them with a stick you wont be wanting any lunch she enquired of arthur ive eaten thanks said arthur no reall y ive eaten im sure you have said the old lady she stirred with the stick after a few mi nutes she fished a lump of some thing out blew on it to cool it a little and then put it in her mouth she chewed on it thoughtfully for a bit then she h obbled slowly across to the pile of dead goat ­‐like things she spat the lump out on to the pile she hobbled slowly back to the can she tried to unhook it from the sort of tripod ­‐like thing that it was hanging from can i help you said arthur jumping up politely he hurried over together they disengaged the tin from the tripod and carried it awkwardly down the slight slope that led downwards from her cave and towards a line of scrubby and gnarled trees which marked the edge of a steep but quite sha llow gully from which a whole new range of offensive smells was emanating ready said the old lady yes said arthur though he didnt know for what one said the old lady two she said three she added arthur realised just in time what she intended together they tossed the contents of the tin into the gully after an hour or two of uncommunicative silence the old woman decided that the solar panels had absorbed enough sunlight to run the photocopier now and she disappeared to rummage inside her cave she emerged at last with a few sheaves of paper and fed the m through the machine she handed the copies to arthur this is er this your advice then is it said arthur leafing through them uncertainly no said the old lady its the story of my life you see the quality of any advice anybody has to of fer has to be judged against the quality of life they actually lead now as you look through this document youll see that ive underlined all the major decisions i ever made to make them stand out theyre all indexed and cross ­‐ referenced see all i can suggest is that if you take decisions that are exactly opposite to the sort of decisions that ive taken then maybe you wont finish up at the end of your life she paused and filled her lungs for a good shout in a smelly old cave like this she grabbed up her table tennis bat rolled up her sleeve stomped off to her pile of dead goat ­‐like things and started to set about the flies with vim and vigour the last village arthur visited consisted entirely of extremely high poles they were so high that it wasnt possible to tell from the ground what was on top of them and arthur had to climb three before he found one that had anything on top of it at all other than a platform covered with bird droppings not an easy task you went up the po les by climbing on the short wooden pegs that had been hammered into them in slowly ascending spirals anybody who was a less diligent tourist than arthur would have taken a couple of snapshots and sloped right off to the nearest bar grill where you als o could buy a range of particularly sweet and gooey chocolate cakes to eat in front of the ascetics but largely as a result of this most of the ascetics had gone now in fact they had mostly gone and set up lucrative therapy centres on some of the more affluent worlds in the north west ripple of the galaxy where the living was easier by a factor of about seventeen million and the chocolate was just fabulous most of the ascetics it turned out had not known about chocolate before they took up ascetici sm most of the clients who came to their therapy centres knew about it all too well at the top of the third pole arthur stopped for a breather he was very hot and out of breath since each pole was about fifty or sixty feet high the world seemed to sw ing vertiginously around him but it didnt worry arthur too much he knew that logically he could not die until he had been to stavromula beta and had therefore managed to cultivate a merry attitude towards extreme personal danger he felt a little gi ddy perched fifty feet up in the air on top of a pole but he dealt with it by eating a sandwich he was just about to embark on reading the photocopied life history of the oracle when he was rather startled to hear a slight cough behind him he turned s o abruptly that he dropped his sandwich which turned downwards through the air and was rather small by the time it was stopped by the ground about thirty feet behind arthur was another pole and alone amongst the sparse forest of about three dozen pole s the top of it was occupied it was occupied by an old man who in turn seemed to be occupied by profound thoughts that were making him scowl excuse me said arthur the man ignored him perhaps he couldnt hear him the breeze was moving about a bi t it was only by chance that arthur had heard the slight cough hello called arthur hello the man at last glanced round at him he seemed surprised to see him arthur couldnt tell if he was surprised and pleased to see him or just surprsised are you open called arthur the man frowned in incomprehension arthur couldnt tell if he couldnt understand or couldnt hear ill pop over called arthur dont go away he clambered off the small platform and climbed quickly down the spirall ing pegs arriving at the bottom quite dizzy he started to make his way over to the pole on which the old man was sitting and then suddenly realised that he had disoriented himself on the way down and didnt know for certain which one it was he looked around for landmarks and worked out which was the right one he climbed it it wasnt damn he said excuse me he called out to the old man again who was now straight in front of him and forty feet away got lost be with you in a minute down he went again getting very hot and bothered when he arrived panting and sweating at the top of the pole that he knew for certain was the right one he realised that the man was somehow or other mucking him about what do you want shouted the old man crossly at him he was now sitting on top of the pole that arthur recognised was the one that he had been on himself when eating his sandwich how did you get over there called arthur in bewilderment you think im going to tell you just like tha t what it took me forty springs summers and autumns of sitting on top of a pole to work out what about winter what about winter dont you sit on the pole in the winter just because i sit up a pole for most of my life said the man doesn t mean im an idiot i go south in the winter got a beach house sit on the chimney stack do you have any advice for a traveller yes get a beach house i see the man stared out over the hot dry scrubby landscape from here arthur could ju st see the old woman a tiny speck in the distance dancing up and down swatting flies you see her called the old man suddenly yes said arthur i consulted her in fact fat lot she knows i got the beach house because she turned it down wha t advice did she give you do exactly the opposite of everything shes done in other words get a beach house i suppose so said arthur well maybe ill get one hmmm the horizon was swimming in a fetid heat haze any other advice a sked arthur other than to do with real estate a beach house isnt just real estate its a state of mind said the man he turned and looked at arthur oddly the mans face was now only a couple of feet away he seemed in one way to be a perfectly normal shape but his body was sitting cross ­‐legged on a pole forty feet away while his face was only two feet from arthurs without moving his head and with out seeming to do anything odd at all he stood up and stepped on to the top of another pole either it was just the heat thought arthur or space was a different shape for him a beach house he said doesnt even have to be on the beach though the best ones are we all like to congregate he went on at boundary conditions really said arthur where land meets water where earth meets air where body meets mind where space meets time we like to be on one side and look at the other arthur got terribly excited this was exactly the sort of thing hed been promised in the brochure here was a man who seemed to be moving through some kind of escher space saying really profound things about all sorts of stuff it was unnerving though t he man was now stepping from pole to ground from ground to pole from pole to pole from pole to horizon and back he was making complete nonsense of arthurs spatial universe please stop arthur said suddenly cant take it huh said the man wit hout the slightest movement he was now back sitting cross ­‐legged on top of the pole forty feet in front of arthur you come to me for advice but you cant cope with anything you dont recognise hmmm so well have to tell you something you already kno w but make it sound like news eh well business as usual i suppose he sighed and squinted mournfully into the distance where you from boy he then asked arthur decided to be clever he was fed up with being mistaken for a complete idiot by everyo ne he ever met tell you what he said youre a seer why dont you tell me the old man sighed again i was just he said passing his hand round behind his head making conversation when he brought his hand round to the front again he had a g lobe of the earth spinning on his up ­‐pointed forefinger it was unmistakable he put it away again arthur was stunned how did you ʹ i cant tell you why not ive come all this way you cannot see what i see because you see what you see you cannot know what i know because you know what you know what i see and what i know cannot be added to what you see and what you know because they are not of the same kind neither can it replace what you see and what you know because that would be to repl ace you yourself hang on can i write this down said arthur excitedly fumbling in his pocket for a pencil you can pick up a copy at the spaceport said the old man theyve got racks of the stuff oh said arthur disappointed well isnt there anything thats perhaps a bit more specific to me everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is specific to you you create a universe by perceiving it so everything in the universe you perceive is specific to you arthur look ed at him doubtfully can i get that at the spaceport too he said check it out said the old man it says in the brochure said arthur pulling it out of his pocket and looking at it again that i can have a special prayer individually tailore d to me and my special needs oh all right said the old man heres a prayer for you got a pencil yes said arthur it goes like this lets see now protect me from knowing what i dont need to know protect me from even knowing that ther e are things to know that i dont know protect me from knowing that i decided not to know about the things that i decided not to know about amen thats it its what you pray silently inside yourself anyway so you may as well have it out in the open hmmm said arthur well thank you ʹ theres another prayer that goes with it thats very important continued the old man so youd better jot this down too ok it goes lord lord lord its best to put that bit in just in cas e you can never be too sure lord lord lord protect me from the consequences of the above prayer amen and thats it most of the trouble people get into in life comes from missing out that last part ever heard of a place called stavromula be ta asked arthur no well thank you for your help said arthur dont mention it said the man on the pole and vanished chapter ford hurled himself at the door of the editor ­‐in­‐chiefs office tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave way once again rolled rapidly across the floor to where the smart grey crushed leather sofa was and set up his strategic ope rational base behind it that at least was the plan unfortunately the smart grey crushed leather sofa wasnt there why thought ford as he twisted himself round in mid ­‐air lurched dived and scuttled for cover behind harls desk did people have t his stupid obsession with rearranging their office furniture every five minutes why for instance replace a perfectly serviceable if rather muted grey crushed leather sofa with what appeared to be a small tank and who was the big guy with the mobile rocket launcher on his shoulder someone from head office couldnt be this was head office at least it was the head office of the guide where these infinidim enterprises guys came from zarquon knew nowhere very sunny judging from the slug ­‐like colour and texture of their skins this was all wrong thought ford people connected with the guide should come from sunny places there were several of them in fact and all of them seemed to be more heavily armed and armoured than you normally expected corporate executives to be even in todays rough and tumble business world he was making a lot of assumptions here of course he was assuming that the big bull ­‐necked slug ­‐like guys were in some way connected with infinidim enterprises but it was a reasonable assumption and he felt happy about it because they had logos on their armour ­‐plating which said infinidim enterprises on them he had a nagging suspicion that this was not a business meeting though he also had a nagging feeling that these slug ­‐like creatures were familiar to him in some way familiar but in an unfamiliar guise well he had been in the room for a good two and a half seconds now and thought that it was probably about time to start doing something constructive he could take a hostage that would be good vann harl was in his swivel chair looking alarmed pale and shaken had probably had some bad news as well as a nasty bang to the back of his head ford leapt to his feet and made a runn ing grab for him under the pretext of getting him into a good solid double underpinned elbow ­‐lock ford managed surreptitiously to slip the ident ­‐i­‐eeze back into harls inner pocket bingo hed done what he came to do now he just had to talk his way out of here ok he said i he paused the big guy with the rocket launcher was turning towards ford prefect and pointing it at him which ford couldnt help feeling was wildly irresponsible behaviour i he started again and then on a sudd en impulse decided to duck there was a deafening roar as flames leapt from the back of the rocket launcher and a rocket leapt from its front the rocket hurtled past ford and hit the large plate ­‐glass window which billowed outwards in a shower of a mil lion shards under the force of the explosion huge shock waves of noise and air pressure reverberated around the room sweeping a couple of chairs a filing cabinet and colin the security robot out of the window ah so theyre not totally rocket ­‐proof af ter all thought ford prefect to himself someone should have a word with somebody about that he disentangled himself from harl and tried to work out which way to run he was surrounded the big guy with the rocket launcher was moving it up into position for another shot ford was completely at a loss for what to do next look he said in a stern voice but he wasnt certain how far saying things like look in a stern voice was necessa rily going to get him and time was not on his side what the hell he thought youre only young once and threw himself out of the window that would at least keep the element of surprise on his side chapter the first thing arthur dent had to do he realised resignedly was to get himself a life this meant he had to find a planet he could have one on it had to be a planet he could breathe on where he could stand up and sit down without experiencing gravitational discomfort it had to be some where where the acid levels were low and the plants didnt actually attack you i hate to be anthropic about this he said to the strange thing behind the desk at the resettlement advice centre on pintleton alpha but id quite like to live somewhere w here the people look vaguely like me as well you know sort of human the strange thing behind the desk waved some of its stranger bits around and seemed rather taken aback by this it oozed and glopped off its seat thrashed its way slowly across the f loor ingested the old metal filing cabinet and then with a great belch excreted the appropriate drawer it popped out a couple of glistening tentacles from its ear removed some files from the drawer sucked the drawer back in and vomited up the cabinet again it thrashed its way back across the floor slimed its way back up on to the seat and slapped the files on the table see anything you fancy it asked arthur looked nervously through some grubby and damp pieces of paper he was definitely in so me backwater part of the galaxy here and somewhere off to the left as far as the universe he knew and recognised was concerned in the space where his own home should have been there was a rotten hick planet drowned with rain and inhabited by thugs and b oghogs even the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy seemed to work only fitfully here which was why he was reduced to making these sorts of enquiries in these sorts of places one place he always asked after was stavromula beta but no one had ever heard of such a planet the available worlds looked pretty grim they had little to offer him because he had little to offer them he had been extremely chastened to realise that although he originally came from a world which had cars and computers and ballet and armagnac he didnt by himself know how any of it worked he couldnt do it left to his own devices he couldnt build a toaster he could just about make a sandwich and that was it there was not a lot of demand for his services arthurs heart sank t his surprised him because he thought it was already about as low as it could possibly be he closed his eyes for a moment he so much wanted to be home he so much wanted his own home world the actual earth he had grown up on not to have been demolished he so much wanted none of this to have happened he so much wanted that when he opened his eyes again he would be standing on the doorstep of his little cottage in the west country of england that the sun would be shining over the green hills the post van would be going up the lane the daffodils would be blooming in his garden and in the distance the pub would be opening for lunch he so much wanted to take the newspaper down to the pub and read it over a pint of bitter he so much wanted to do the cr ossword he so much wanted to be able to get completely stuck on across he opened his eyes the strange thing was pulsating irritably at him tapping some kind of pseudopodia on the desk arthur shook his head and looked at the next sheet of paper grim he thought and the next very grim and the next oh now that looked better it was a world called bartledan it had oxygen it had green hills it even it seemed had a renowned literary culture but the thing that most aroused his interest was a photograph of a small bunch of bartledanian people standing around in a village square smiling pleasantly at the camera ah he said and held the picture up to the strange thing behind the desk its eyes squirmed out on stalks and roiled up a nd down the piece of paper leaving a glistening trail of slime all over it yes it said with distaste they do look exactly like you arthur moved to bartledan and using some money he had made by selling some toenail clippings and spit to a dna bank he bought himself a room in the village featured in the picture it was pleasant there the air was balmy the people looked like him and seemed not to mind him being there they didnt attack him with anything he bought some clothes and a cupboard to put them in he had got himself a life now he had to find a purpose in it at first he tried to sit and read but the literature of bartledan famed though it was throughout this sector of the galaxy for its subtlety and grace didnt seem to be able to sustain his interest the problem was that it wasnt actually about human bei ngs after all it wasnt about what human beings wanted the people of bartledan were remarkably like human beings to look at but when you said good evening to one he would tend to look around with a slight sense of surprise sniff the air and say that yes he supposed that it probably was a goodish evening now that arthur came to mention it no what i meant was to wish you a good evening arthur would say or rather used to say he soon learned to avoid these conversations i mean that i hope yo u have a good evening he would add more puzzlement wish the bartledanian would say at last in polite bafflement er yes arthur would then have said im just expressing the hope that hope yes what is hope good question tho ught arthur to himself and retreated back to his room to think about things on the one hand he could only recognise and respect what he learnt about the bartledanian view of the universe which was that the universe was what the universe was take it or leave it on the other hand he could not help but feel that not to desire anything not ever to wish or to hope was just not natural natural there was a tricky word he had long ago realised that a lot of things that he had thought of as natural li ke buying people presents at christmas stopping at red lights or falling at a rate of feetsecondsecond were just the habits of his own world and didnt necessarily work the same way anywhere else but not to wish ʹ that really couldnt be natural c ould it that would be like not breathing breathing was another thing that the bartledanians didnt do despite all the oxygen in the atmosphere they just stood there occasionally they ran around and played netball and stuff without ever wishing to wi n though of course ʹ they would just play and whoever won won but they never actually breathed it was for some reason unnecessary arthur quickly learned that playing netball with them was just too spooky though they looked like humans and even m oved and sounded like humans they didnt breathe and they didnt wish for things breathing and wishing for things on the other hand was just about all that arthur seemed to do all day sometimes he would wish for things so much that his breathing woul d get quite agitated and he would have to go and lie down for a bit on his own in his small room so far from the world which had given birth to him that his brain could not even process the sort of numbers involved without just going limp he preferre d not to think about it he preferred just to sit and read ʹ or at least he would prefer it if there was anything worth reading but nobody in bartledanian stories ever wanted anything not even a glass of water certainly they would fetch one if they wer e thirsty but if there wasnt one available they would think no more about it he had just read an entire book in which the main character had over the course of a week done some work in his garden played a great deal of netball helped mend a road f athered a child on his wife and then unexpectedly died of thirst just before the last chapter in exasperation arthur had combed his way back through the book and in the end had found a passing reference to some problem with the plumbing in chapter and that was it so the guy dies it just happens it wasnt even the climax of the book because there wasnt one the character died about a third of the way through the penultimate chapter of the book and the rest of it was just more stuff about road ­‐mend ing the book just finished dead at the one hundred thousandth word because that was how long books were on bartledan arthur threw the book across the room sold the room and left he started to travel with wild abandon trading in more and more spit toenails fingernails blood hair anything that anybody wanted for tickets for semen he discovered he could travel first class he settled nowhere but only existed in the hermetic twilight world of the cabins of hyperspatial starships eating drink ing sleeping watching movies only stopping at spaceports to donate more dna and catch the next long ­‐haul ship out he waited and waited for another accident to happen the trouble with trying to make the right accident happen is that it wont that is not what accident means the accident that eventually occurred was not what he had planned at all the ship he was on blipped in hyperspace flickered horribly between ninety ­‐ seven different points in the galaxy simultaneously caught the unexpected grav itational pull of an uncharted planet in one of them became ensnared in its outer atmosphere and began to fall screaming and tearing into it the ships systems protested all the way down that everything was perfectly normal and under control but when it went into a final hectic spin ripped wildly through half a mile of trees and finally exploded into a seething ball of flame it became clear that this was not the case fire engulfed the forest boiled into the night then neatly put itself out as al l unscheduled fires over a certain size are now required to do by law for a short while afterwards other small fires flared up here and there as odd pieces of scattered debris exploded quietly in their own time then they too died away arthur dent bec ause of the sheer boredom of endless inter ­‐stellar flight was the only one on board who had actually familiarised himself with the ships safety procedures in case of an unscheduled landing and was therefore the sole survivor he lay dazed broken and bl eeding in a sort of fluffy pink plastic cocoon with have a nice day printed in over three thousand different languages all over it black roaring silences swam sickeningly through his shattered mind he knew with a kind of resigned certainty that he wo uld survive because he had not yet been to stavromula beta after what seemed an eternity of pain and darkness he became aware of quiet shapes moving around him chapter ford tumbled through the open air in a cloud of glass splinters and chair parts again he hadnt really thought things through really and was just playing it by ear buying time at times of major crisis he found it was often quite helpful to have his l ife flash before his eyes it gave him a chance to reflect on things see things in some sort of perspective and it sometimes furnished him with a vital clue as to what to do next there was the ground rushing up to meet him at feet per second per sec ond but he would he thought deal with that problem when he got to it first things first ah here it came his childhood hum drum stuff hed been through it all before images flashed by boring times on betelgeuse five zaphod beeblebrox as a kid yes he knew all that he wished he had some kind of fast forward in his brain his seventh birthday party being given his first towel come on come on he was twisting and turning downwards the outside air at this height a cold shock to his lungs tryi ng not to inhale glass early voyages to other planets oh for zarks sake this was like some sort of bloody travelogue documentary before the main feature first beginning to work for the guide ah those were the days they worked out of a hut on the bwenelli atoll on fanalla before the riktanarqals and the danqueds vertled it half a dozen guys some towels a handful of highly sophisticated digital devices and most importantly a lot of dreams no most importantly a lot of fanallan rum to be compl etely accurate that ol janx spirit was the absolute most important thing then the fanallan rum and also some of the beaches on the atoll where the local girls would hang out but the dreams were important as well whatever happened to those he couldn t quite remember what the dreams were in fact but they had seemed immensely important at the time they had certainly not involved this huge towering office block he was now falling down the side of all of that had come when some of the original team ha d started to settle down and get greedy while he and others had stayed out in the field researching and hitch hiking and gradually becoming more and more isolated from the corporate nightmare the guide had inexorably turned into and the architectural monstrosity it had come to occupy where were the dreams in that he thought of all the corporate lawyers who occupied half of the building all the operatives who occupied the lower levels and all the sub ­‐editors and their secretaries and their secretar ies lawyers and their secretaries lawyers secretaries and worst of all the accountants and the marketing department he had half a mind just to keep on falling two fingers to the lot of them he was just passing the seventeenth floor now where the marketing department hung out load of tosspots all arguing about what colour the guide should be and exercising their infinitely infallible skills of being wise after the event if any of them had chosen to look out of the window at that moment they would have been startled by the sight of ford prefect dropping past them to his certain death and flicking v ­‐signs at them sixteenth floor sub ­‐editors bastards what about all that copy of his theyd cut fifteen years of research hed filed from one planet alone and theyd cut it to two words mostly harmless v ­‐signs to them as well fifteenth floor logistical administration whatever that was about they all had big cars that he thought was w hat that was about fourteenth floor personnel he had a very shrewd suspicion that it was they who had engineered his fifteen ­‐year exile while the guide metamorphosed into the corporate monolith or rather duolith ʹ mustnt forget the lawyers it had b ecome thirteenth floor research and development hang about thirteenth floor he was having to think rather fast at the moment because the situation was becoming a little urgent he suddenly remembered the floor display panel in the elevator it hadnt had a thirteenth floor hed thought no more about it because having spent fifteen years on the rather backward planet earth where they were superstitious about the number thirteen he was used to being in buildings that numbered their floors without it no reason for that here though the windows of the thirteenth floor he could not help noticing as he flashed swiftly by them were darkened what was going on in there he started to remember all the stuff that harl had been talking about one ne w multi ­‐dimensional guide spread across an infinite number of universes it had sounded the way harl had put it like wild meaninglessness dreamed up by the marketing department with the backing of the accountants if it was any more real than that then it was a very weird and dangerous idea was it real what was going on behind the darkened windows of the sealed ­‐off thirteenth floor ford felt a rising sense of curiosity and then a rising sense of panic that was the complete list of rising feelings h e had in every other respect he was falling very rapidly he really ought to turn his mind to wondering how he was going to get out of this situation alive he glanced down a hundred feet or so below him people were milling around some of them beginnin g to look up expectantly clearing a space for him even temporarily calling off the wonderful and completely fatuous hunt for wockets he would hate to disappoint them but about two feet below him he hadnt realised before was colin colin had obvious ly been happily dancing attendance and waiting for him to decide what he wanted to do colin ford bawled colin didnt respond ford went cold then he suddenly realised that he hadnt told colin his name was colin come up here ford bawled colin bobbed up beside him colin was enjoying the ride down immensely and hoped that ford was too colins world went unexpectedly dark as fords towel suddenly enveloped him colin immediately felt himself get much much heavier he was thrilled and de lighted by the challenge that ford had presented him with just not sure if he could handle it that was all the towel was slung over colin ford was hanging from the towel gripping to its seams other hitchhikers had seen fit to modify their towels in exotic ways weaving all kinds of esoteric tools and utilities and even computer equipment into their fabric ford was a purist he liked to keep things simple he carried a regular towel from a regular domestic soft furnishings shop it even had a kind of blue and pink floral pattern despite his repeated attempts to bleach and stone wash it it had a couple of pieces of wire threaded into it a bit of flexible writing stick and also some nutrients soaked into one of the corners of the fabric so he could s uck it in an emergency but otherwise it was a simple towel you could dry your face on the only actual modification he had been persuaded by a friend to make to it was to reinforce the seams ford gripped the seams like a maniac they were still descen ding but the rate had slowed up colin he shouted nothing your name shouted ford is colin so when i shout up colin i want you colin to go up ok up colin nothing or rather a sort of muffled groaning sound from colin ford was very anxious they were descending very slowly now but ford was very anxious about the sort of people he could see assembling on the ground beneath him friendly local wocket ­‐ hunting types were dispersing and thick heavy bull ­‐necked slug ­‐like creatu res with rocket launchers were it seemed sliding out of what was usually called thin air thin air as all experienced galactic travellers well know is in fact extremely thick with multi ­‐ dimensional complexities up bellowed ford again up colin go up colin was straining and groaning they were now more or less stationary in the air ford felt as if his fingers were breaking up they stayed put up up up a slug was preparing to launch a rocket at him ford couldnt believe it he was hanging from a towel in mid ­‐air and a slug was preparing to fire rockets at him he was running out of anything he could think of doing and was beginning to get seriously alarmed this was the sort of predicament that he usually relied on having the g uide available for to give advice however infuriating or glib but this was not a moment for reaching into his pocket and the guide seemed to be no longer a friend and ally but was now itself a source of danger these were the guide offices he was hangin g outside for zarks sake in danger of his life from the people who now appeared to own the thing what had become of all the dreams he vaguely remembered having on the bwenelli atoll they should have let it all be they should have stayed there stayed on the beach loved good women lived on fish he should have known it was all wrong the moment they started hanging grand pianos over the sea ­‐monster pool in the atrium he began to feel thoroughly wasted and miserable his fingers were on fire with clen ched pain and his ankle was still hurting oh thank you ankle he thought to himself bitterly thank you for bringing up your problems at this time i expect youd like a nice warm footbath to make you feel better wouldnt you or at least youd like me to he had an idea the armoured slug had hoisted the rocket launcher up on to its shoulder the rocket was presumably designed to hit anything in its path that moved ford tried not to sweat because he could feel his grip on the seams of his towel slipping with the toe of his good foot he nudged and prised at the heel of the shoe on his hurting foot go up damn you ford muttered hopelessly to colin who was cheerily straining away but unable to rise ford worked away at the heel of his shoe he was trying to judge the timing but there was no point just go for it he only had one shot and that was it he had now eased the back of his shoe down off his heel his twisted ankle felt a little better well that was good wasnt it with his othe r foot he kicked at the heel of the shoe it slipped off his foot and fell through the air about half a second later a rocket erupted up from the muzzle of its launcher encountered the shoe falling through its path went straight for it hit it and expl oded with a great sense of satisfaction and achievement this happened about fifteen feet from the ground the main force of the explosion was directed downwards where a second earlier there had been a squad of infinidim enterprises executives with a rocket launcher standing on an elegant terraced plaza paved with large slabs of lustrous stone cut from the a ncient alabastrum quarries of zentalquabula there was now instead a bit of a pit with nasty bits in it a great wump of hot air welled up from the explosion throwing ford and colin violently up into the sky ford fought desperately and blindly to hold o n and failed he turned helplessly upwards through the sky reached the peak of a parabola paused and then started to fall again he fell and fell and fell and suddenly winded himself badly on colin who was still rising he clasped himself desperately o n to the small spherical robot colin slewed wildly through the air towards the tower of the guide offices trying delightedly to control himself and slow down the world span sickeningly round fords head as they span and twisted round each other and the n equally sickeningly everything suddenly stopped ford found himself deposited dizzily on a window ledge his towel fell past and he grabbed at it and caught it colin bobbed in the air inches away from him ford looked around himself in a bruised bleeding and breath ­‐less daze the ledge was only about a foot wide and he was perched precariously on it thirteen stories up thirteen he knew they were thirteen stories up because the windows were dark he was bitterly upset he had bought those shoe s for some absurd price in a store on the lower east side in new york he had as a result written an entire essay on the joys of great footwear all of which had been jettisoned in the mostly harmless debacle damn everything and now one of the shoes was gone he threw his head back and stared at the sky it wouldnt be such a grim tragedy if the planet in question hadnt been demolished which meant that he wouldnt even be able to get another pair yes given the infinite sideways extension of pro bability there was of course an almost infinite multiplicity of planets earth but when you came down to it a major pair of shoes wasnt something you could just replace by mucking about in multi ­‐dimensional spacetime he sighed oh well hed bette r make the best of it at least it had saved his life for the time being he was perched on a foot ­‐wide ledge thirteen stories up the side of a building and he wasnt at all sure that that was worth a good shoe he stared in woozily through the darkened glass it was as dark and silent as the tomb no that was a ridiculous thing to think hed been to some great parties in tombs could he detect some movement he wasnt quite sure it seemed that he could see some kind of weird flapping shadow perh aps it was just blood dribbling over his eyelashes he wiped it away boy hed love to have a farm somewhere keep some sheep he peered into the window again trying to make out what the shape was but he had the feeling so common in todays universe t hat he was looking into some kind of optical illusion and that his eyes were just playing silly buggers with him was there a bird of some kind in there was that what they had hidden away up here on a concealed floor behind darkened rocket ­‐ proof glass someones aviary there was certainly something flapping about in there but it seemed like not so much a bird more a kind of bird ­‐shaped hole in space he closed his eyes which hed been wanting to do for a bit anyway he wondered what the hell to do n ext jump climb he didnt think there was going to be any way of breaking in ok the supposedly rocket ­‐proof glass hadnt stood up when it came to it to an actual rocket but then that had been a rocket that had been fired at very short range from ins ide which probably wasnt what the engineers who designed it had had in mind it didnt mean he was going to be able to break the window here by wrapping his fist in his towel and punching what the hell he tried it anyway and hurt his fist it was just as well he couldnt get a good swing from where he was sitting or he might have hurt it quite badly the building had been sturdily reinforced when it was completely rebuilt after the frogstar attack and was probably the most heavily armoured publishing c ompany in the business but there was always he thought some weakness in any system designed by a corporate committee he had already found one of them the engineers who designed the windows had not expected them to be hit by a rocket from short range f rom the inside so the window had failed so what would the engineers not be expecting someone sitting on the ledge outside the window to do he wracked his brains for a moment or so before he got it the thing they wouldnt be expecting him to do was to be there in the first place only an absolute idiot would be sitting where he was so he was winning already a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools he pulled his newly acquired credit card from his pocket slid it into a crack where the window met its surrounding frame and did something a rocket would not have been able to do he wiggled it around a bit he felt a catch slip he slid the window open an d almost fell backwards off the ledge laughing giving thanks as he did so for the great ventilation and telephone riots of srdt the great ventilation and telephone riots of srdt had started off as just a lot of hot air hot air was of course the problem that ventilation was supposed to solve and generally it had solved the problem reasonably well up to the point when someone invented air ­‐ conditioning which solved the problem far more throbbingly and that was all well and good provided you could stand the noise and the dribbling until someone else came up with something even sexier and smarter than air ­‐conditioning which was called in ­‐building climate control now this was quite something the ma jor differences from just ordinary air ­‐conditioning were that it was thrillingly more expensive involved a huge amount of sophisticated measuring and regulating equipment which was far better at knowing moment by moment what kind of air people wanted to breathe than mere people did it also meant that to be sure that mere people didnt muck up the sophisticated calculations which the system was making on their behalf all the windows in the buildings were built sealed shut this is true while the sys tems were being installed a number of people who were going to work in the buildings found themselves having conversations with breathe ­‐o­‐smart systems fitters which went something like this but what if we want to have the windows open you wont wa nt to have the windows open with new breathe ­‐o­‐ smart yes but supposing we just wanted to have them open for a little bit you wont want to have them open even for a little bit the new breathe ­‐o­‐smart system will see to that hmmm enjoy brea the­‐o­‐smart ok so what if the breathe ­‐o­‐smart breaks down or goes wrong or something ah one of the smartest features of the breathe ­‐o­‐smart is that it cannot possibly go wrong so no worries on that score enjoy your breathing now and have a ni ce day it was of course as a result of the great ventilation and telephone riots of srdt that all mechanical or electrical or quantum ­‐mechanical or hydraulic or even wind steam or piston ­‐ driven devices are now requited to have a certain legen d emblazoned on them somewhere it doesnt matter how small the object is the designers of the object have got to find a way of squeezing the legend in somewhere because it is their attention which is being drawn to it rather than necessarily that of the users the legend is this the major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair major heat waves started to coincide with almost magical precision with major failures of the breathe ­‐o­‐smart systems to begin with this merely caused simmering resentment and only a few deaths from asphyxiation the real horror erupted on the day that three events happened simultaneously the first event was that breathe ­‐o­‐smart inc issued a statement to the effect that best results were achieved by using their systems in temperate climates the second event was the breakdown of a breathe ­‐o­‐smart syst em on a particularly hot and humid day with the resulting evacuation of many hundreds of office staff into the street where they met the third event which was a rampaging mob of long ­‐distance telephone operators who had got so twisted with having to say all day and every day thank you for using bss to every single idiot who picked up a phone that they had finally taken to the streets with trash cans megaphones and rifles in the ensuing days of carnage every single window in the city rocket ­‐proof or not was smashed usually to accompanying cries of get off the line asshole i dont care what number you want what extension youre calling from go and stick a firework up your bottom yeeehaah hoo hoo hoo velooooom squawk and a variety of other animal noises that they didnt get a chance to practise in the normal line of their work as a result of this all telephone operators were granted a constitutional right to s ay use bss and die at least once an hour when answering the phone and all office buildings were required to have windows that opened even if only a little bit another unexpected result was a dramatic lowering of the suicide rate all sorts of stres sed and rising executives who had been forced during the dark days of the breathe ­‐o­‐smart tyranny to jump in front of trains or stab themselves could now just clamber out on to their own window ledges and leap off at their leisure what frequently happe ned though was that in the moment or two they had to look around and gather their thoughts they would suddenly discover that all they had really needed was a breath of air and a fresh perspective on things and maybe also a farm on which they could keep a few sheep another completely unlooked for result was that ford prefect stranded thirteen stories up a heavily armoured building armed with nothing but a towel and a credit card was nevertheless able to clamber through a supposedly rocket ­‐proof window to safety he closed the window neatly after him having first allowed colin to follow him through and then started to look around for this bird thing the thing he realised about the windows was this because they had been converted into openable wind ows after they had first been designed to be impregnable they were in fact much less secure than if they had been designed as openable windows in the first place hey ho its a funny old life he was just thinking to himself when he suddenly realised that the room he had gone to all this trouble to break into was not a very interesting one he stopped in surprise where was the strange flapping shape where was anything that was worth all this palaver ­‐the extraordinary veil of secrecy that seemed to lie over this room and the equally extraordinary sequence of events that had seemed to conspire to get him into it the room like every other room in this building now was done out in some appallingly tasteful grey there were a few charts and drawings on the wall most of them were meaningless to ford but then he came across something that was obviously a mock ­‐up for a poster of some kind there was a kind of bird ­‐like logo on it and a slogan which said the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy mk ii the single most astounding thing of any kind ever coming soon to a dimension near you no more information than that ford looked around again then his attention was gradually drawn to colin the absurdly over ­‐happy security robot who was cowering in a corner of the room gibbering with what seemed strangely like fear odd thought ford he looked around to see what it was that colin might have been reacting to then he saw something that he hadnt noticed before lying quietly on top of a workbench it was circular and black and about the size of a small side plate its top and its bottom were smoothly convex so that it resembled a small lightweight throwing discus its surfaces seemed to be completely smooth unbroken and featureless it was doing nothing then ford noticed that there was something written on it strange there hadnt been anything written on it a moment ago and now suddenly there was there just didnt seem to have been any observable transition between the two states all it said in small alarming letters was a single word panic a moment ago there hadnt been any marks or cracks in its surfac e now there were they were growing panic the guide mk ii said ford begin to do as he was told he had just remembered why the slug ­‐like creatures looked familiar their colour scheme was a kind of corporate grey but in all other respects they looked exactly like vogons chapter the ship dropped quietly to land on the edge of the wide clearing a hundred yards or so from the village it arrived suddenly and unexpectedly but with a minimum of fuss one moment it was a perfectly ordinary late afternoon in the early autumn ʹ the leaves were just beginning to turn red and gold the river was beginning to swell again with the rains from the mountains in the north the plumage of the pikka birds was beginning to thicken in anticipation of the comi ng winter frosts any day now the perfectly normal beasts would start their thunderous migration across the plains and old thrashbarg was beginning to mutter to himself as he hobbled his way around the village a muttering which meant that he was rehearsi ng and elaborating the stories that he would tell of the past year once the evenings had drawn in and people had no choice but to gather round the fire and listen to him and grumble and say that that wasnt how they remembered it ʹ and the next moment there was a spaceship sitting there gleaming in the warm autumn sun it hummed for a bit and then stopped it wasnt a big spaceship if the villagers had been experts on spaceships they would have known at once that it was a pretty nifty one a small sleek hrundi four ­‐berth runabout with just about every optional extra in the brochure except advanced vectoid stabilisis which only wimps went for you cant get a good tight sharp curve round a tri ­‐lateral time axis with advanced vectoid stabilisis all righ t its a bit safer but it makes the handling go all soggy the villagers didnt know all that of course most of them here on the remote planet of lamuella had never seen a spaceship certainly not one that was all in one piece and as it shone warmly in the evening light it was just the most extraordinary thing they had come across since the day kirp caught a fish with a head at both ends everybody had fallen silent whereas a moment before two or three dozen people had been wandering about chatter ing chopping wood carrying water teasing the pikka birds or just amiably trying to stay out of old thrashbargs way suddenly all activity died away and everybody turned to look at the strange object in amazement or not quite everybody the pikka bi rds tended to be amazed by completely different things a perfectly ordinary leaf lying unexpectedly on a stone would cause them to skitter off in paroxysms of confusion sunrise took them completely by surprise every morning but the arrival of an alien c raft from another world simply failed to engage any part of their attention they continued to kar and rit and huk as they pecked for seeds on the ground the river continued with its quiet spacious burbling also the noise of loud and tuneless singing from the last hut on the left continued unabated suddenly with a slight click and a hum a door folded itself outwards and downwards from the spaceship then for a minute or two nothing further seemed to happen other than the loud singing from the last hut on the left and the thing just sat there some of the villagers particularly the boys began to edge forward a little bit to have a closer look old thrashbarg tried to shoo them back this was exactly the sort of thing that old thrashbarg didnt like to have happening he hadnt foretold it not even slightly and even though he would be able to wrestle the whole thing into his continuing story somehow or other it really was all getting a bit much to deal with he strode forward pushed the boys back and raised his arms and his ancient knobbly staff into the air the long warm light of the evening sun caught him nicely he prepared to welcome whatever gods these were as if he had been expecting them all along still nothing happened gradually it became clear that there was some kind of argument going on inside the craft time went by and old thrashbargs arms were beginning to ache suddenly the ramp folded itself back up again that made it easy for thrashbarg they were demons and he had repulsed them the reason he hadnt foretold it was that prudence and modesty forbade almost immediately a different ramp folded itself out on the other side of the craft from where thrashbarg was standing and two figures at last emerged on it s till arguing with each other and ignoring everybody even thrashbarg whom they wouldnt even have noticed from where they were standing old thrashbarg chewed angrily on his beard to continue to stand there with his arms upraised to kneel with his hea d bowed forward and his staff held out pointing at them to fall backwards as if overcome in some titanic inner struggle perhaps just to go off to the woods and live in a tree for a year without speaking to anyone he opted just to drop his arms smartly as if he had done what he meant to do they were really hurting so he didnt have much choice he made a small secret sign he had just invented towards the ramp which had closed and then made three and a half steps backwards so he could at least get a go od look at whoever these people were and then decide what to do next the taller one was a very good looking woman wearing soft and crumply clothes old thrashbarg didnt know this but they were made of rymplontm a new synthetic fabric which was terrifi c for space travel because it looked its absolute best when it was all creased and sweaty the shorter one was a girl she was awkward and sullen looking and was wearing clothes which looked their absolute worst when they were all creased and sweaty and what was more she almost certainly knew it all eyes watched them except for the pikka birds which had their own things to watch the woman stood and looked around her she had a purposeful air about her there was obviously something in particular sh e wanted but she didnt know exactly where to find it she glanced from face to face among the villagers assembled curiously around her without apparently seeing what she was looking for thrashbarg had no idea how to play this at all and decided to resort to chanting he threw back his head and began to wail but was instantly interrupted by a fresh outbreak of song from the hut of the sandwich maker the last one on the left the woman looked round sharply and gradually a smile came over her face wit hout so much as a glance at old thrashbarg she started to walk towards the hut there is an art to the business of making sandwiches which it is given to few ever to find the time to explore in depth it is a simple task but the opportunities for satisf action are many and profound choosing the right bread for instance the sandwich maker had spent many months in daily consultation and experiment with grarp the baker and eventually they had between them created a loaf of exactly the consistency that was dense enough to slice thinly and neatly while still being light moist and having that fine nutty flavour which best enhanced the savour of roast perfectly normal beast flesh there was also the geometry of the slice to be refined the precise relationsh ips between the width and height of the slice and also its thickness which would give the proper sense of bulk and weight to the finished sandwich here again lightness was a virtue but so too were firmness generosity and that promise of succulence and savour that is the hallmark of a truly intense sandwich experience the proper tools of course were crucial and many were the days that the sandwich maker when not engaged with the baker at his oven would spend with strinder the tool maker weighing and balancing knives taking them to the forge and back again suppleness strength keenness of edge length and balance were all enthusiastically debated theories put forward tested refined and many was the evening when the sandwich maker and the too l maker could be seen silhouetted against the light of the setting sun and the tool makers forge making slow sweeping movements through the air trying one knife after another comparing the weight of this one with the balance of another the suppleness of a third and the handle binding of a fourth three knives altogether were required first there was the knife for the slicing of the bread a firm authoritative blade which imposed a clear and defining will on a loaf then there was the butter ­‐spreading knife which was a whippy little number but still with a firm backbone to it early versions had been a little too whippy but now the combination of flexibility with a core of strength was exactly right to achieve the maximum smoothness and grace of sprea d the chief amongst the knives of course was the carving knife this was the knife that would not merely impose its will on the medium through which it moved as did the bread knife it must work with it be guided by the grain of the meat to achieve slices of the most exquisite consistency and translucency that would slide away in filmy folds from the main hunk of meat the sandwich maker would then flip each sheet with a smooth flick of the wrist on to the beautifully proportioned lower bread slice trim it with four deft strokes and then at last perform the magic that the children of the village so longed to gather round and watch with rapt attention and wonder with just four more dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the trimmings into a perfectly fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the primary slice for every sandwich the size and shape of the trimmings were different but the sandwich maker would always effortlessly and without hesitation assemble them into a pattern which fitted perfect ly a second layer of meat and a second layer of trimmings and the main act of creation would be accomplished the sandwich maker would pass what he had made to his assistant who would then add a few slices of newcumber and fladish and a touch of splagbe rry sauce and then apply the topmost layer of bread and cut the sandwich with a fourth and altogether plainer knife it was not that these were not also skillful operations but they were lesser skills to be performed by a dedicated apprentice who would one day when the sandwich maker finally laid down his tools take over from him it was an exalted position and that apprentice drimple was the envy of his fellows there were those in the village who were happy chopping wood those who were content carr ying water but to be the sandwich maker was very heaven and so the sandwich maker sang as he worked he was using the last of the years salted meat it was a little past its best now but still the rich savour of perfectly normal beast meat was someth ing unsurpassed in any of the sandwich makers previous experience next week it was anticipated that the perfectly normal beasts would appear again for their regular migration whereupon the whole village would once again be plunged into frenetic action hunting the beasts killing perhaps six maybe even seven dozen of the thousands that thundered past then the beasts must be rapidly butchered and cleaned with most of the meat salted to keep it through the winter months until the return migration in the spring which would replenish their supplies the very best of the meat would be roasted straight away for the feast that marked the autumn passage the celebrations would last for three days of sheer exuberance dancing and stories that old thrashbarg w ould tell of how the hunt had gone stories that he would have been busy sitting making up in his hut while the rest of the village was out doing the actual hunting and then the very very best of the meat would be saved from the feast and delivered cold to the sandwich maker and the sandwich maker would exercise on it the skills that he had brought to them from the gods and make the exquisite sandwiches of the third season of which the whole village would partake before beginning the next day to pre pare themselves for the rigours of the coming winter today he was just making ordinary sandwiches if such delicacies so lovingly crafted could ever be called ordinary today his assistant was away so the sandwich maker was applying his own garnish which he was happy to do he was happy with just about everything in fact he sliced he sang he flipped each slice of meat neatly on to a slice of bread trimmed it and assembled all the trimmings into their jigsaw a little salad a little sauce another slice of bread another sandwich another verse of yellow submarine hello arthur the sandwich maker almost sliced his thumb off the villagers had watched in consternation as the woman had marched boldly to the hut of the sandwich maker the sandwich maker had been sent to them by almighty bob in a burning fiery chariot this at least was what thrashbarg said and thrashbarg was the authority on these things so at least thrashbarg claimed and thrashbarg was and so on and so on it was hardly worth arguing about a few villagers wondered why almighty bob would send his onlie begotten sandwich maker in a burning fiery chariot rather than perhaps in one that might have landed quietly without destroying half the forest filling it with ghosts and also injuring the sandwich maker quite badly old thrashbarg said that it was the ineffable will of bob and when they asked him what ineffable meant he said look it up this was a problem because old thrashbarg had the only dictionary and he wouldnt let them borrow it they asked him why not and he said that it was not for them to know the will of almighty bob and when they asked him why not again he said because he said so anyway somebody sneaked into old thrashbargs hut one day while he was out having a swim and looked up ineffable ineffable apparently meant unknowable indescribable unutterable not to be known or spoken about so that cleared that up at least they had got the sandwiches one day old thrashbarg said that almighty bob had decreed that he thrashbarg was to have first pick of the sandwiches the villagers asked him when this had happened exactly and t hrashbarg said it had happened yesterday when they werent looking have faith old thrashbarg said or burn they let him have first pick of the sandwiches it seemed easiest and now this woman had just arrived out of nowhere and gone straight fo r the sandwich makers hut his fame had obviously spread though it was hard to know where to since according to old thrashbarg there wasnt anywhere else anyway wherever it was she had come from presumably somewhere ineffable she was here now and w as in the sandwich makers hut who was she and who was the strange girl who was hanging around outside the hut moodily and kicking at stones and showing every sign of not wanting to be there it seemed odd that someone should come all the way from somewh ere ineffable in a chariot that was obviously a vast improvement on the burning fiery one which had brought them the sandwich maker if she didnt even want to be here they all looked to thrashbarg but he was on his knees mumbling and looking very firml y up into the sky and not catching anybody elses eye until hed thought of something trillian said the sandwich maker sucking his bleeding thumb what who when where exactly the questions i was going to ask you said trillian looking around arthurs hut it was neatly laid out with his kitchen utensils there were some fairly basic cupboards and shelves and a basic bed in the corner a door at the back of the room led to something trillian couldnt see because the door was clo sed nice she said but in an enquiring tone of voice she couldnt quite make out what the set ­‐up was very nice said arthur wonderfully nice i dont know when ive ever been anywhere nicer im happy here they like me i make sandwiches for th em and er well thats it really they like me and i make sandwiches for them sounds er idyllic said arthur firmly it is it really is i dont expect youd like it very much but for me its well its perfect look sit down please make yourself comfortable can i get you anything er a sandwich trillian picked up a sandwich and looked at it she sniffed it carefully try it said arthur its good trillian took a nibble then a bite and munched on it thought fully it is good she said looking at it my lifes work said arthur trying to sound proud and hoping he didnt sound like a complete idiot he was used to being revered a bit and was having to go through some unexpected mental gear changes whats the mea t in it asked trillian ah yes thats um thats perfectly normal beast its what perfectly normal beast its a bit like a cow or rather a bull kind of like a buffalo in fact large charging sort of animal so whats odd about it nothing its perfectly normal i see its just a bit odd where it comes from tricia frowned and stopped chewing where does it come from she asked with her mouth full she wasnt going to swallow until she knew well its not just a matter of where it comes from its also where it goes to its all right its perfectly safe to swallow ive eaten tons of it its great very succulent very tender slightly sweet flavour with a long dark finish trillian stil l hadnt swallowed where she said does it come from and where does it go to they come from a point just slightly to the east of the hondo mountains theyre the big ones behind us here you must have seen them as you came in and then they swee p in their thousands across the great anhondo plains and er well thats it really thats where they come from thats where they go trillian frowned there was something she wasnt quite getting about this i probably havent made it quite clear said arthur when i say they come from a point to the east of the hondo mountains i mean that thats where they suddenly appear then they sweep across the anhondo plains and well vanish really we have about six days to catch as many of them as we can before they disappear in the spring they do it again only the other way round you see reluctantly trillian swallowed it was either that or spit it out and it did in fact taste pretty good i see she said once she had reassured herself that sh e didnt seem to be suffering any ill effects and why are they called perfectly normal beasts well i think because otherwise people might think it was a bit odd i think old thrashbarg called them that he says that they come from where they come fr om and they go to where they go to and that its bobs will and thats all there is to it who just dont even ask well you look well on it i feel well you look well im well im very well well thats good yes good good nice of you to drop in thanks well said arthur casting around himself astounding how hard it was to think of anything to say to someone after all this time i expect youre wondering how i found you said trillian yes said arth ur i was wondering exactly that how did you find me well as you may or may not know i now work for one of the big sub­‐etha broadcasting networks that ʹ i did know that said arthur suddenly remembering yes youve done very well thats te rrific very exciting well done must be a lot of fun exhausting all that rushing around i expect it must be yes we have access to virtually every kind of information i found your name on the passenger list of the ship that crashed arthur was astonished you mean they knew about the crash well of course they knew you dont have a whole spaceliner disappear without someone knowing about it but you mean they knew where it had happened they knew id survived yes but nobodys ever been to look or search or rescue theres been absolutely nothing well there wouldnt be its a whole complicated insurance thing they just bury the whole thing pretend it never happened the insurance business is completely screwy n ow you know theyve reintroduced the death penalty for insurance company directors really said arthur no i didnt for what offence trillian frowned what do you mean offence i see trillian gave arthur a long look and then in a new tone of voice said its time for you to take responsibility arthur arthur tried to understand this remark he found it often took a moment or so before he saw exactly what it was that people were driving at so he let a moment or two pass at a leisurely rate life was so pleasant and relaxed these days there was time to let things sink in he let it sink in he still didnt quite understand what she meant though so in the end he had to say so trillian gave him a cool smile and then turned back to the door of the hut random she called come in come and meet your father chapter as the guide folded itself back into a smooth dark disk ford realised some pretty hectic stuff or at least he tried to realise it but it was too hectic to take in all in one go his head was hammering his ankle was hurting and though he didnt like to be a wimp about his ankle he always found that intense multi ­‐dimensional logic was something he u nderstood best in the bath he needed time to think about this time a tall drink and some kind of rich foamy oil he had to get out of here he had to get the guide out of here he didnt think theyd make it together he glanced wildly round the room think think think it had to be something simple and obvious if he was right in his nasty lurking suspicion that he was dealing with nasty lurking vogons then the more simple and obvious the better suddenly he saw what he needed he wouldnt try to beat the system he would just use it the frightening thing about the vogons was their absolute mindless determination to do whatever mindless thing it was they were determined to do there was never any point in trying to appeal to their reason because they didnt have any however if you kept your nerve you could sometimes exploit their blinkered bludgeoning insistence on being bludgeoning and blinkered it wasnt merely that their left hand didnt always know what t heir right hand was doing so to speak quite often their right hand had a pretty hazy notion as well did he dare just post the thing to himself did he dare just put it in the system and let the vogons work out how to get the thing to him while at the same time they were busy as they probably would be tearing the building apart to find out where hed hidden it yes feverishly he packed it he wrapped it he labelled it with a moments pause to wonder if he was really doing the right thing he committed the package to the buildings internal mail chute colin he said turning to the little hovering ball i am going to abandon you to your fate im so happy said colin make the most of it said ford because what i want you to do is to nursemaid that package out of the building theyll probably incinerate you when they find you and i wont be here to help it will be very very nasty for you and thats just too bad got it i gurgle with pleasure said colin go said ford colin obediently dived down the mail chute in pursuit of his charge now ford had only himself to worry about but that was still quite a substantial worry there were noises of heavy running footsteps outside the door which he had taken the precaution of locking and shifting a large filing cabinet in front of he was worried that everyth ing had gone so smoothly every thing had fitted terribly well he had hurtled through the day with reckless abandon and yet everything had worked out with uncanny neatnes s except for his shoe he was bitter about his shoe that was an account that was going to have to be settled with a deafening roar the door exploded inwards in the turmoil of smoke and dust he could see large slug ­‐like creatures hurrying through so everything was going well was it everything was working out as if the most extraordinary luck was on his side well hed see about that in a spirit of scientific enquiry he hurled himself out of the window again chapter the first month getti ng to know each other was a little difficult the second month trying to come to terms with what theyd got to know about each other in the first month was much easier the third month when the box arrived was very tricky indeed at the beginning it was a problem even trying to explain what a month was this had been a pleasantly simple matter for arthur here on lamuella the days were just a little over twenty ­‐five hours long which basically meant an extra hour in bed every sin gle day and of course having regularly to reset his watch which arthur rather enjoyed doing he also felt at home with the number of suns and moons which lamuella had ʹ one of each ʹ as opposed to some of the planets hed fetched up on from time to tim e which had had ridiculous numbers of them the planet orbited its single sun every three hundred days which was a good number because it meant the year didnt drag by the moon orbited lamuella just over nine times a year which meant that a month was a little over thirty days which was absolutel y perfect because it gave you a little more time to get things done in it was not merely reassuringly like earth it was actually rather an improvement random on the other hand thought she was trapped in a recurring nightmare she would have crying fi ts and think the moon was out to get her every night it was there and then when it went the sun came out and followed her over and over again trillian had warned arthur that random might have some difficulty in adjusting to a more regular lifestyle than she had been used to up till now but arthur hadnt been ready for actual howling at the moon he hadnt been ready for any of this of course his daughter his daughter he and trillian had never even ʹ had they he was absolutely convinced he wou ld have remembered what about zaphod not the same species arthur trillian had answered when i decided i wanted a child they ran all sorts of genetic tests on me and could find only one match anywhere it was only later that it dawned on me i doub le checked and i was right they dont usually like to tell you but i insisted you mean you went to a dna bank arthur had asked pop ­‐eyed yes but she wasnt quite as random as her name suggests because of course you were the only homo sapiens donor i must say though it seems you were quite a frequent flyer arthur had stared wide ­‐eyed at the unhappy looking girl who was slouching awkwardly in the door ­‐frame looking at him but when how long you mean what age is she yes the wrong one what do you mean i mean that i havent any idea what well in my time line i think its about ten years since i had her but shes obviously quite a lot older than that i spend my life going backwards and forwards in time you see the job i used to take her with me when i could but it just wasnt always possible then i used to put her into day care time zones but you just cant get reliable time tracking now you leave them there in the morning youve simply no idea ho w old theyll be in the evening you complain till youre blue in the face but it doesnt get you anywhere i left her at one of the places for a few hours once and when i came back shed passed puberty ive done all i can arthur its over to you ive got a war to cover the ten seconds that passed after trillian left were about the longest of arthur dents life time we know is relative you can travel light years through the stars and back and if you do it at the speed of light then when you r eturn you may have aged mere seconds while your twin brother or sister will have aged twenty thirty forty or however many years it is depending on how far you travelled this will come to you as a profound personal shock particularly if you didnt kn ow you had a twin brother or sister the seconds that you have been absent for will not have been sufficient time to prepare you for the shock of new and strangely distended family relationships when you return ten seconds silence was not enough time for arthur to reassemble his whole view of himself and his life in a way that suddenly included an entire new daughter of whose merest existence he had had not the slightest inkling of a suspicion when he had woken that morning deep emotional family ties ca nnot be constructed in ten seconds however far and fast you travel away from them and arthur could only feel helpless bewildered and numb as he looked at the girl standing in his doorway staring at his floor he supposed that there was no point in pre tending not to be hopeless he walked over and he hugged her i dont love you he said im sorry i dont even know you yet but give me a few minutes we live in strange times we also live in strange places each in a universe of our own the people with whom we populate our universes are the shadows of whole other universes intersecting with our own being able to glance out into this bewildering complexity of infinite recursion and say things like oh hi ed nice tan hows carol involves a great deal of filtering skill for which all conscious entities have eventually to develop a capacity in order to protect themselves from the contemplation of the chaos through which they seethe and tumble so give your kid a break ok extract from practical parenting in a fractally demented universe whats this arthur had almost given up that is to say he was not going to give up he was absolutely not going to give up not now not ever but if he had been the sort of person who was going to give up this was probably the time he would have done it not content with being surly bad ­‐tempered wanting to go and play in the paleozoic era not seeing why they had to have the gravity on the whole time and shouting at the sun to s top following her random had also used his carving knife to dig up stones to throw at the pikka birds for looking at her like that arthur didnt even know if lamuella had had a paleozoic era according to old thrashbarg the planet had been found fully ­‐formed in the navel of a giant earwig at four ­‐thirty one vroonday afternoon and although arthur as a seasoned galactic traveller with good o level passes in physics and geography had fairly serious doubts about this it was rather a waste of time tryin g to argue with old thrashbarg and there had never been much point before he sighed as he sat nursing the chipped and bent knife he was going to love her if it killed him or her or both it wasnt easy being a father he knew that no one had ever said it was going to be easy but that wasnt the point because hed never asked about being one in the first place he was doing his best every moment that he could wrest away from making sandwiches he was spending with her talking to her walking with her sitting on the hill with her watching the sun go down over he valley in which the village nestled trying to find out about her life trying to explain to her about his it was a tricky business the common ground between them apart from the fact that t hey had almost identical genes was about the size of a pebble or rather it was about the size of trillian and of her they had slightly differing views whats this he suddenly realised she had been talking to him and he hadnt noticed or rather he had not recognized her voice instead of the usual tone of voice in which she spoke to him which was bitter and truculent she was just asking him a simple question he looked round in surprise she was sitting there on a stool in the corner of the hu t in that rather hunched way she had knees together feet splayed out with her dark hair hanging down over her face as she looked at something she had cradled in her hands arthur went over to her a little nervously her mood swings were very unpredictable but so far theyd all been between different types of bad ones outbreaks of bitter recrimination would give way without warning to abject self ­‐pity and then long bouts of sullen despair which were punctuated with su dden acts of mindless violence against inanimate objects and demands to go to electric clubs not only were there no electric clubs on lamuella there were no clubs at all and in fact no electricity there was a forge and a bakery a few carts and a wel l but those were the high water mark of lamuellan technology and a fair number of randoms unquenchable rages were directed against the sheer incomprehensible backwardness of the place she could pick up sub ­‐etha tv on a small flex ­‐o­‐panel which had been surgically implanted in her wrist but that didnt cheer her up at all because it was full of news of insanely exciting things happening in every other part of the galaxy than here it would also give her frequent news of her mother who had dumped her t o go off and cover some war which now seemed not to have happened or at least to have gone all wrong in some way because of the absence of any proper intelligence gathering it also gave her access to lots of great adventure shows featuring all sorts of f antastically expensive spaceships crashing into each other the villagers were absolutely hypnotised by all these wonderful magic images flashing over her wrist they had only ever seen one spaceship crash and it had been so frightening violent and shoc king and had caused so much horrible devastation fire and death that stupidly they had never realised it was entertainment old thrashbarg had been so astonished by it that he had instantly seen random as an emissary from bob but had fairly soon after wards decided that in fact she had been sent as a test of his faith if not of his patience he was also alarmed at the number of spaceship crashes he had to start incorporating into his holy stories if he was to hold the attention of the villagers and no t have them rushing off to peer at randoms wrist all the time at the moment she was not peering at her wrist her wrist was turned off arthur squatted down quietly beside her to see what she was looking at it was his watch he had taken it off when h ed gone to shower under the local waterfall and random had found it and was trying to work it out its just a watch he said its to tell the time i know that she said but you keep on fiddling with it and it still doesnt tell the right ti me or even anything like it she brought up the display on her wrist panel which automatically produced a readout of local time her wrist panel had quietly got on with the business of measuring the local gravity and orbital momentum and had noticed w here the sun was and tracked its movement in the sky all within the first few minutes of randoms arrival it had then quickly picked up clues from its environment as to what the local unit conventions were and reset itself appropriately it did this sort of thing continually which was particularly valuable if you did a lot of travelling in time as well as space random frowned at her fathers watch which didnt do any of this arthur was very fond of it it was a better one than he would ever have aff orded himself he had been given it on his twenty ­‐second birthday by a rich and guilt ­‐ridden godfather who had forgotten every single birthday he had had up till then and also his name it had the day the date the phases of the moon it had to albert o n his twenty ­‐first birthday and the wrong date engraved on the battered and scratched surface of its back in letters that were still just about visible the watch had been through a considerahle amount of stuff in the last few years most of which would fall well outside the warranty he didnt suppose of course that the warranty had especially mentioned that the watch was guaranteed to be accurate only within the very particular gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth and so long as the day was twenty ­‐four hours long and the planet didnt explode and so on these were such basic assumptions that even the lawyers would have missed them luckily his watch was a wind ­‐up one or at least a self ­‐winder nowhere else in the galaxy would he have found batteries of precisely the dimensions and power specifications that were perfectly standard on earth so what are all these numbers asked ra ndom arthur took it from her these numbers round the edge mark the hours in the little window on the right it says thu which means thursday and the number is which means its the fourteenth day of the month of may which is what it says in this window over here and this sort of crescent ­‐shaped window at the top tells you about the phases of the moon in other words it tells you how much of the moon is lit up at night by the sun which depends on the relative positions of the sun and the moon a nd well the earth the earth said random yes and thats where you came from and where mum came from yes random took the watch back from him and looked at it again clearly baffled by something then she held it up to her ear and listened in puzzlement whats that noise its ticking thats the mechanism that drives the watch its called clockwork its all kind of interlocking cogs and springs that work to turn the hands round at exactly the right speed to mark the hours and minutes and days and so on random carried on peering at it theres something puzzling you said arthur what is it yes said random at last whys it all in hardware arthur suggested they went for a walk he felt there were things they s hould discuss and for once random seemed if not precisely amenable and willing then at least not growling from randoms point of view this was also all very weird it wasnt that she wanted to be difficult as such it was just that she didnt know ho w or what else to be who was this guy what was this life she was supposed to lead what was this world she was supposed to lead it in and what was this universe that kept coming at her through her eyes and ears what was it for what did it want shed been born in a spaceship that had been going from somewhere to somewhere else and when it had got to somewhere else somewhere else had only turned out to be another somewhere that you had to get to somewhere else again from and so on it was her norm al expectation that she was supposed to be somewhere else it was normal for her to feel that she was in the wrong place then constant time travel had only compounded this problem and had led to the feeling that she was not only always in the wrong pla ce but she was also almost always there at the wrong time she didnt notice that she felt this because it was the only way she ever felt just as it never seemed odd to her that nearly everywhere she went she needed either to wear weights or anti ­‐gravi ty suits and usually special apparatus for breathing as well the only places you could ever feel right were worlds you designed for yourself to inhabit ­‐ virtual realities in the electric clubs it had never occurred to her that the real universe was someth ing you could actually fit into and that included this lamuella place her mother had dumped her in and it also included this person who had bestowed on her this precious and magical gift of life in return for a seat upgrade it was just as well he had t urned out to be rather kind and friendly or there would have been trouble really shed got a specially sharpened stone in her pocket she could cause a lot of trouble with it can be very dangerous to see things from somebody elses point of view without the proper training they sat on the spot that arthur particularly liked on the side of a hill overlooking the valley the sun was going down over the village the only thing that arthur wasnt quite so fond of was being able to see a little way into the next valley where a deep dark mangled furrow in the forest marked the spot where his ship had crashed but maybe that was what kept bringing him back here there were plenty of spots from which you could survey the lush rolling countryside of lamuella but this was the one he was drawn to with its nagging dark spot of fear and pain nestling just on the edge of his vision he had never been there again since he had been pulled out of the wreckage wouldnt couldnt bear it in fact he had gone some of the way back to it the very next day while he was still numb and spinning with shock he had a broken leg a couple of broken ribs some bad burns and was not really thinking coherently but had insisted that the villagers take him which uneasily they had he had not managed to get right to the actual spot where the ground had bubbled and melted however and had at last hobbled away from the horror for ever soon word had got around that the whole area was haunted and no on e had ventured back there ever since the land was full of beautiful verdant and delightful valleys ʹ no point in going to a highly worrying one let the past hold on to itself and let the present move forward into the future random cradled the watch in her hands slowly turning it to let the long light of the evening sun shine warmly in the scratches and scuffs of the thick glass it fascinated her watching the spidery little second hand ticking its way round every time it co mpleted a full circle the longer of the two main hands had moved on exactly to the next of the sixty small divisions round the dial and when the long hand had made its own full circle the smaller hand had moved on to the next of the main digits youv e been watching it for over an hour said arthur quietly i know she said an hour is when the big hand has gone all the way round yes thats right then ive been watching it for an hour and seventeen minutes she smiled with a deep and mysterious pleasure and moved very slightly so that she was resting just a little against his arm arthur felt a small sigh escape from him that had been pent up inside his chest for weeks he wanted to put his arm around his daughters shoulders but fe lt it was too early yet and that she would shy away from him but something was working something was easing inside her the watch meant something to her that nothing in her life had so far managed to do arthur was not sure that he had really understood what it was yet but he was profoundly pleased and relieved that something had reached her explain to me again said random theres nothing really to it said arthur clockwork was something that developed over hundreds of years earth years yes it became finer and finer and more and more intricate it was highly skilled and delicate work it had to be made very small and it had to carry on working accurately however much you waved it around or dropped it but only on one planet well that was where it was made you see it was never expected to go anywhere else and deal with different suns and moons and magnetic fields and things i mean the thing still goes perfectly well but it doesnt really mean much this far from switzerland from where switzerland thats where these were made small hilly country tiresomely neat the people who made them didnt really know there were other worlds quite a big thing not to know well yes so where did they come from the y that is we we just sort of grew there we evolved on the earth from i dont know some kind of sludge or something like this watch um i dont think the watch grew out of sludge you dont understand random suddenly leaped to her feet shouting you dont understand you dont understand me you dont understand anything i hate you for being so stupid she started to run hectically down the hill still clutching the watch and shouting that she hated him arthur jumped up startled and at a loss he started to run after her through the stringy and clumpy grass it was hard and painful for him when he had broken his leg in the crash it had not been a clean break and it had not healed cleanly he was stumb ling and wincing as he ran suddenly she turned and faced him her face dark with anger she brandished the watch at him you dont understand that theres somewhere this belongs somewhere it works somewhere that it fits she turned and ran again s he was fit and fleet ­‐footed and arthur could not remotely keep up with her it wasnt that he had not expected being a father to be this difficult it was that he hadnt expected to be a father at all particularly not suddenly and unexpectedly on an alie n planet random turned to shout at him again for some reason he stopped each time she did who do you think i am she demanded angrily your upgrade who do you think mum thought i was some sort of ticket to the life she didnt have i dont kno w what you mean by that said arthur panting and hurting you dont know what anybody means by anything what do you mean shut up shut up shut up tell me please tell me what does she mean by saying the life she didnt have she wished shed stayed on earth she wished she hadnt gone off with that stupid brain ­‐dead fruit gum zaphod she thinks she would have had a different life but said arthur she would have been killed she would have been killed when the world was destroyed thats a different life isnt it thats she wouldnt have had to have me she hates me you cant mean that how could anyone possibly er i mean she had me because i was meant to make things fit for her that was my job but i fit ted even worse than she did so she just shut me off and carried on with her stupid life whats stupid about her life shes fantastically successful isnt she shes all over time and space all over the sub ­‐etha tv networks stupid stupid stupid stupid random turned and ran off again arthur couldnt keep up with her and at last he had to sit down for a bit and let the pain in his leg subside the turmoil in his head he didnt know what to do with at all he hobbled i nto the village an hour later it was getting dark the villagers he passed said hello but there was a sense of nervousness and of not quite knowing what was going on or what to do about it in the air old thrashbarg had been seen pulling on his beard a f air bit and looking at the moon and that was not a good sign either arthur went into his hut random was sitting hunched quietly over the table im sorry she said im so sorry thats all right said arthur as gently as he knew how its good to well to have a little chat theres so much we have to learn and understand about each other and life isnt well it isnt all just tea and sandwiches im so sorry she said again sobbing arthur went up to her and put his arm round her shoulder she didnt resist or pull away then arthur saw what it was she was so sorry about in the pool of light thrown by a lamuellan lantern lay arthurs watch random had forced the bac k off it with the back edge of the butter spreading knife and all of the minute cogs and springs and levers were lying in a tiny cock ­‐eyed mess where shed been fiddling with them i just wanted to see how it worked said random how it all fitted tog ether im so sorry i cant get it back together im sorry im sorry im sorry i dont know what to do ill get it repaired really ill get it repaired the following day thrashbarg came round and said all sorts of bob stuff he tried to exert a calming influence by inviting random to let her mind dwell on the ineffable mystery of the giant earwig and random said there was no giant earwig and thrashbarg went very cold and silent and said she would be cast into outer darkness random said good s hed been born there and the next day the parcel arrived this was all getting a bit eventful in fact when the parcel arrived delivered by a kind of robot drone that dropped out of the sky making droning robot noises it brought with it a sense whic h gradually began to permeate through the whole village that it was almost one event too many it wasnt the robot drones fault all it required was arthur dents signature or thumb print or just a few scrapings of skin cells from the nape of his neck and it would be on its way again it hung around waiting not quite sure what all this resentment was about meanwhile kirp had caught another fish with a head at both ends but on closer inspection it turned out that it was in fact two fish cut in half a nd sewn together rather badly so not only had kirp failed to rekindle any great interest in two ­‐headed fish but he had seriously cast doubt on the authenticity of the first one only the pikka birds seemed to feel that everything was exactly normal the robot drone got arthurs signature and made its escape arthur bore the parcel back to his hut and sat and looked at it lets open it said random who was feeling much more cheerful this morning now that everything around her had got thoroughly weird but arthur said no why not its not addressed to me yes it is no it isnt its addressed to well its addressed to ford prefect in care of me ford prefect is he the one who yes said arthur tartly ive heard about him i expect you have lets open it anyway what else are we going to do i dont know said arthur who really wasnt sure he had taken his damaged knives over to the forge bright and early that morning and strinder had had a look at them and sa id that he would see what he could do they had tried the usual business of waving the knives through the air feeling for the point of balance and the point of flex and so on but the joy was gone from it and arthur had a sad feeling that his sandwich m aking days were probably numbered he hung his head the next appearance of the perfectly normal beasts was imminent but arthur felt that the usual festivities of hunting and feasting were going to be rather muted and uncertain something had happened here on lamuella and arthur had a horrible feeling that it was him what do you think it is urged random turning the parcel over in her hands i dont know said arthur something bad and worrying though how do you know random protested because anything to do with ford prefect is bound to be worse and more worrying than something that isnt said arthur believe me youre upset about something arent you said random arthur sighed im just feeling a little jumpy and unsettle d i think said arthur im sorry said random and put the package down again she could see that it really would upset him if she opened it she would just have to do it when he wasnt looking chapter arthur wasnt quite certain which he noticed as being missing first when he noticed that the one wasnt there his mind instantly leapt to the other and he knew immediately that they were both gone and that something insanely bad and difficult to deal with would happen as a result random was not there and neither was the parcel he had left it up on a shelf all day in plain view it was an exercise in trust he knew that one of the things he was supposed to do as a parent was to show trust in his chil d to build a sense of trust and confidence into the bedrock of relationship between them he had had a nasty feeling that that might be an idiotic thing to do but he did it anyway and sure enough it had turned out to be an idiotic thing to do you live and learn at any rate you live you also panic arthur ran out of the hut it was the middle of the evening the light was getting dim and a storm was brewing he could not see her anywhere nor any sign of her he asked no one had seen her he asked again no one else had seen her they were going home for the night a little wind was whipping round the edge of the village picking things up and tossing them around in a dangerously casual manner he found old thrashbarg and asked him thrashbarg look ed at him stonily and then pointed in the one direction that arthur had dreaded and had therefore instinctively known was the way she would have gone so now he knew the worst she had gone where she thought he would not follow her he looked up at th e sky which was sullen streaked and livid and reflected that it was the sort of sky that the four horsemen of the apocalypse wouldnt feel like a bunch of complete idiots riding out of with a heavy sense of the utmost foreboding he set off on the track that led to the forest in the next valley the first heavy blobs of rain began to hit the ground as arthur tried to drag himself to some sort of run random reached the crest of the hill and looked down into the next valley it had been a longer and hard er climb than she had anticipated she was a little worried that doing the trip at night was not that great an idea but her father had been mooching around near the hut all day trying to pretend to either her or himself that he wasnt guarding the parcel at last hed had to go over to the forge to talk with strinder about the knives and random had seized her opportunity and done a runner with the parcel it was perfectly clear that she couldnt just open the thing there in the hut or even in the villa ge he might have come across her at any moment which meant that she had to go where she wouldnt be followed she could stop where she was now she had gone this way in the hope that he wouldnt follow her and even if he did he would never find her up in the wooded parts of the hill with night drawing in and the rain starting all the way up the parcel had been jiggling under her arm it was a satisfyingly hunky sort of thing a box with a square top about the length of her forearm on each side and a bout the length of her hand deep wrapped up in brown plasper with an ingenious new form of self­‐knotting string it didnt rattle as she shook it but she sensed that its weight was concentrated excitingly at the centre having come so far though there was a certain satisfaction in not stopping here but carrying on down into what seemed to be almost a forbidden area ʹ where her fathers ship had come down she wasnt exactly certain what the word haunted meant but it might be fun to find out she wo uld keep going and save the parcel up for when she got there it was getting darker though she hadnt used her tiny electric torch yet because she didnt want to be visible from a distance she would have to use it now but it probably didnt matter si nce she would be on the other side of the hill which divided the valleys from each other she turned her torch on almost at the same moment a fork of lightning ripped across the valley into which she was heading and startled her considerably as the dark ness shuddered back around her and a clap of thunder rolled out across the land she felt suddenly rather small and lost with just a feeble pencil of light bobbing in her hand perhaps she should stop after all and open the parcel here or maybe she should go back and come out again tomorrow it was only a momentary hesitation though she knew there was no going back tonight and sensed that there was no going back ever she headed on down the side of the hill the rain was beginning to pick up now where a short while ago it had been a few heavy blobs it was settling in for a good pour now hissing in the trees and the ground was getting slippery under her feet at least she thought it was the rain hissing in the trees shadows were leaping and leering at her as her light bobbed through the trees onwards and downwards she hurried on for another ten or fifteen minutes soaked to the skin now and shivering and gradually became aware that there seemed to be some other light somewhere ahead of her it wa s very faint and she wasnt certain if she was imagining it or not she turned off her torch to see there did seem to be some sort of dim glow ahead she couldnt tell what it was she turned her torch back on and continued down the hill towards whatever it was there was something wrong with the woods though she couldnt immediately say what it was but they didnt seem like sprightly healthy woods looking forward to a good spring the trees were lolling at sickly angles and had a sort of pallid blig hted look about them random more than once had the worrying sensation that they were trying to reach towards her as she passed them but it was just a trick of the way that her light caused their shadows to flicker and lurch suddenly something fell out of a tree in front of her she leapt backwards with alarm dropping both the torch and the box as she did so she went down into a crouch pulling the specially sharpened rock out of her pocket the thing that had fallen out of the tree was moving the t orch was lying on the ground and pointing towards it and a vast grotesque shadow was slowly lurching through the light towards her she could hear faint rustling and screeching noises over the steady hiss of the rain she scrabbled on the ground for the torch found it and shone it directly at the creature at the same moment another dropped from a tree just a few feet away she swung the torch wildly from one to another she held her rock up ready to throw they were quite small in fact it was the a ngle of the light that had made them loom so large not only small but small furry and cuddly and there was another dropping from the trees it fell through the beam of light so she saw it quite clearly it fell neatly and precisely turned and then like the other two started slowly and purposefully to advance on random she stayed rooted to the spot she still had her rock poised and ready to throw but was increasingly conscious of the fact that the things she had it poised and ready to throw a t were squirrels or at least squirrel ­‐like things soft warm cuddly squirrel ­‐like things advancing on her in a way she wasnt at all certain she liked she shone her torch directly on the first of them it was making aggressive hectoring screeching noises and carrying in one of its little fists a small tattered piece of wet pink rag random hefted her rock menacingly in her hand but it made no impression at all on the squirrel advancing on her with its wet piece of rag she backed away she didn t know at all how to deal with this if they had been vicious snarling slavering beasts with glistening fangs she would have pitched into them with a will but squirrels behaving like this she couldnt quite handle she backed away again the second squir rel was starting to make a flanking manoeuvre round to her right carrying a cup some kind of acorn thing the third was right behind it and making its own advance what was it carrying some little scrap of soggy paper random thought she stepped back again caught her ankle against the root of a tree and fell over backwards instantly the first squirrel darted forward and was on top of her advancing along her stomach with cold purpose in its eyes and a piece of wet rag in its fist random tried to jump up but only managed to jump about an inch the startled movement of the squirrel on her stomach startled her in return the squirrel froze gripping her skin through her soaking shirt with its tiny claws then slowly inch by inch it made its way u p her stopped and proffered her the rag she felt almost hypnotised by the strangeness of the thing and its tiny glinting eyes it proffered her the rag again it pushed it at her repeatedly screeching insistently till at last nervously hesitantly she took the thing from it it continued to watch her intently its eyes darting all over her face she had no idea what to do rain and mud were streaming down her face and she had a squirrel sitting on her she wiped some mud out of her eyes with the rag the squirrel shrieked triumphantly grabbed the rag back leapt off her ran scampering into the dark enclosing night darted up into a tree dived into a hole in the trunk settled back and lit a cigarette meanwhile random was trying to fend off the squirrel with the acorn cup full of rain and the one with the paper she shuffled backwards on her bottom no she shouted go away they darted back in fright and then darted right forward again with their gifts she brandished her rock at them go she yelled the squirrels scampered round in consternation then one darted straight at her dropped the acorn cup in her lap turned and ran off into the night the other stood quivering for a moment then put its scrap of paper neatly down in fron t of her and disappeared as well she was alone again but trembling with confusion she got unsteadily to her feet picked up her rock and her parcel then paused and picked up the scrap of paper as well it was so soggy and dilapidated it was hard to make out what it was it seemed just to be a fragment of an in ­‐flight magazine just as random was trying to understand exactly what it was that this all meant a man walked out into the clearing in which she was standing raised a vicious ­‐looking gun and shot her arthur was thrashing around hopelessly two or three miles behind her on the upward side of the hill within minutes of setting out he had gone back again and equipped himself with a lamp not an electric one the only electric light in the place was the one that random had brought with her this was a kind of dim hurricane lamp a perforated metal canister from strinders forge which contained a reservoir of inflammable fish oil a wick of knotted dried grass and was wrapped in a translucent film made fr om dried membranes from the gut of a perfectly normal beast it had now gone out arthur jiggled around with it in a thoroughly pointless kind of a way for a few seconds there was clearly no way he was going to get the thing suddenly to burst into flame again in the middle of a rainstorm but its impossible not to make a token effort reluctantly he threw the thing aside what to do this was hopeless he was absolutely sodden his clothes heavy and billowing with the rain and now he was lost in the dark as well for a brief second he was lost in the blinding light and then he was lost in the dark again the sheet of lightning had at least shown him that he was very close to the brow of the hill once he had breasted that he would well he wasnt certain what he would do hed have to work that out when he got there he limped forward and upwards a few minutes later he knew that he was standing panting at the top there was some kind of dim glow in the distance below him he had no idea what it was and indeed he hardly liked to think it was the only thing he had to make towards though so he started to make his way stumbling lost and frightened towards it the flash of lethal light passed straight through random and about two seconds lat er so did the man who had shot it other than that he paid her no attention whatsoever he had shot someone standing behind her and when she turned to look he was kneeling over the body and going through its pockets the tableau froze and vanished it was replaced a second later by a giant pair of teeth framed by immense and perfectly glossed red lips a huge blue brush appeared out of nowhere and started foamily to scrub at the teeth which continued to hang there gleaming in the shimmering curtain of rain random blinked at it twice before she got it it was a commercial the guy who had shot her was part of a holographic in ­‐flight movie she must now be very close to where the ship had crashed obviously some of its systems were more indestructible than others the next half ­‐mile of the journey was particularly troublesome not only did she have the cold and the rain and the night to contend with but also the fractured and thrashing remains of the ships on ­‐board entertainment system spaceships an d jetcars and helipods crashed and exploded continuously around her illuminating the night villainous people in strange hats smuggled dangerous drugs through her and the combined orchestra and chorus of the hallapolis state opera performed the closing m arch of the anjaqantine star guard from act iv of rizgars blamwellamum of woont in a little glade somewhere off to her left and then she was standing on the lip of a very nasty looking and bubbly ­‐edged crater there was still a faint warm glow coming fr om what would otherwise have looked like an enormous piece of caramelised chewing gum in the centre of the pit the melted remains of a great spaceship she stood looking at it for a longish while and then at last started to walk along and around the edg e of the crater she was no longer certain what she was looking for but kept moving anyway keeping the horror of the pit to her left the rain was beginning to ease off a little but it was still extremely wet and since she didnt know what it was that was in the box whether it was perhaps something delicate or damageable she thought she ought to find somewhere reasonably dry to open it she hoped she hadnt already damaged it by dropping it she played her torch around the surrounding trees which w ere thin on the ground here and mostly charred and broken in the middle distance she thought she could see a jumbled outcrop of rock which might provide some shelter and she started to pick her way towards it all around she found the detritus that had been ejected from the ship as it broke up before the final fireball after she had moved two or three hundred yards from the edge of the crater she came across the tattered fragments of some fluffy pink material sodden muddied and drooping amongst the broken trees she guessed correctly that this must be the remains of the escape cocoon that had saved her fathers life she went and looked at it more closely and then noticed something close to it on the ground half covered in mud she picked it up and wiped the mud off it it was some kind of electronic device the size of a small book feebly glowing on its cover in response to her touch were some large friendly letters they said dont panic she knew what this was it was her fathers copy of th e hitchhikers guide to the galaxy she felt instantly reassured by it turned her head up to the thundery sky and let some rain wash over her face and into her mouth she shook her head and hurried on towards the rocks clambering up and over them she almost immediately found the perfect thing the mouth of a cave she played her torch into its interior it seemed to be dry and safe picking her way carefully she walked in it was quite spacious but didnt go that deep exhausted and relieved she sat on a convenient rock put the box down in front of her and started immediately to open it chapter for a long period of time there was much speculation and controversy about where the so ­‐called missing matter of the universe had got to all over the galaxy the science departments of all the major universities were acquiring more and more elaborate equipment to probe and search the hearts of distant galaxies and then the very centre and the very edges of the whole universe but when eventually it was tracked down it turned out in fact to be all the stuff which the equipment had been packed in there w as quite a large quantity of missing matter in the box little soft round white pellets of missing matter which random discarded for future generations of physicists to track down and discover all over again once the findings of the current generation of physicists had been lost and forgotten about out of the pellets of missing matter she lifted the featureless black disk she put it down on a rock beside her and sifted amongst all the missing matter to see if there was anything else a manual or some attachments or something but there was nothing else at all just the black disk she shone the torch on it as she did so cracks began to appear along its apparently featureless surface random backed away nervously but then saw that the thing whatever it was was merely unfolding itself the process was wonderfully beautiful it was extraordinarily elaborate but also simple and elegant it was like a piece of self ­‐ opening origami or a rosebud blooming into a rose in just a few seconds where just a few moments earlier there had been a smoothly curved black disk there was now a bird a bird hovering there random continued to back away from it carefully and watchfully it was a little like a pikka bird only rather smaller that is to say in fact it was larger or to be more exact precisely the same size or at least not less than twice the size it was also both a lot bluer and a lot pinker than pikka birds while at the same time being perfectly black there was also something very odd about it which random couldnt immediately make out it certainly shared with pikka birds the impression it gave that it was watching something that you couldnt see suddenly it vanished then just as suddenly everything went black random dropped into a tense crouch feeling for the specially sharpened rock in her pocket again then the blackness receded and rolled itself up into a ball and then the blackness was the bird again it hung i n the air in front of her beating its wings slowly and staring at her excuse me it said suddenly i just have to calibrate myself can you hear me when i say this when you say what demanded random good said the bird and can you hear me when i say this it spoke this time at a much higher pitch yes of course i can said random and can you hear me when i say this it said this time in a sepulchrally deep voice yes there was then a pause no obviously not said the bird after a few seconds good well your hearing range is obviously between and khz so is this comfortable for you it said in a pleasant light tenor no uncomfortable harmonics screeching away in the upper register obviously not good i can use t hose as data channels now how many of me can you see suddenly the air was full of nothing but interlocking birds random was well used to spending time in virtual realities but this was something far weirder than anything she had previously encounter ed it was as if the whole geometry of space was redefined in seamless bird shapes random gasped and flung her arms round her face her arms moving through bird ­‐shaped space hmmm obviously way too many said the bird how about now it concertina ed into a tunnel of birds as if it was a bird caught between parallel mirrors reflecting infinitely into the distance what are you shouted random well come to that in a minute said the bird just how many please well youre sort of random gestured helplessly off into the distance i see still infinite in extent but at least were homing in on the right dimensional matrix good no the answer is an orange and two lemons lemons if i have three lem ons and three oranges and i lose two oranges and a lemon what do i have left huh ok so you think that time flows that way do you interesting am i still infinite it asked ballooning this way and that in space am i infinite now how yellow a m i moment by moment the bird was going through mind ­‐mangling transformations of shape and extent i cant said random bewildered you dont have to answer i can tell from watching you now so am i your mother am i a rock do i seem huge squ ishy and sinuously intertwined no how about now am i going backwards for once the bird was perfectly still and steady no said random well i was in fact i was moving backwards in time hmmm well i think weve sorted all that out now if you d like to know i can tell you that in your universe you move freely in three dimensions that you call space you move in a straight line in a fourth which you call time and stay rooted to one place in a fifth which is the first fundamental of probabili ty after that it gets a hit complicated and theres all sorts of stuff going on in dimensions to that you really wouldnt want to know about all you really need to know for the moment is that the universe is a lot more complicated than you might t hink even if you start from a position of thinking its pretty damn complicated in the first place i can easily not say words like damn if it offends you say what you damn well like i will what the hell are you demanded random i am the guide in your universe i am your guide in fact i inhabit what is technically known as the whole sort of general mish mash which means well let me show you it turned in mid ­‐air and swooped out of the cave and then perched on a rock just beneath an overhang out of the rain which was getting heavier again come on it said watch this random didnt like being bossed around by a bird but she followed it to the mouth of the cave anyway still fingering the rock in her pocket rain said the bird you see just rain i know what rain is sheets of the stuff were sweeping through the night moonlight sifting through it so what is it what do you mean what is it look who are you what were you doing in that box why have i spe nt a night running through the forest fending off demented squirrels to find that all ive got at the end of it is a bird asking me what rain is its just water falling through the bloody air thats what it is anything else you want to know or can we go home now there was a long pause before the bird answered you want to go home i havent got a home random almost shocked herself she screamed the words so loudly look into the rain said the bird guide im looking into the rain what else is there to look at what do you see what do you mean you stupid bird i just see a load of rain its just water falling what shapes do you see in the water shapes there arent any shapes its just just just a mish mash said the bird guide yes now what do you see just on the very edge of visibility a thin faint beam fanned out of the birds eyes in the dry air beneath the overhang ther e was nothing to see where the beam hit the drops of rain as they fell through it there was a flat sheet of light so bright and vivid it seemed solid oh great a laser show said random fractiously never seen one of those before of course except at about five million rock concerts tell me what you see just a flat sheet stupid bird theres nothing there that wasnt there before im just using light to draw your attention to certain drops at certain moments now what do you see the light shut off nothing im doing exactly the same thing but with ultra ­‐violet light you cant see it so whats the point of showing me something i cant see so that you understand that just because you see something it doesnt mean to sa y its there and if you dont see something it doesnt mean to say its not there its only what your senses bring to your attention im bored with this said random and then gasped hanging in the rain was a giant and very vivid three ­‐dimensional image of her father looking startled about something about two miles away behind random her father struggling his way through the woods suddenly stopped he was startled to see an image of himself looking startled about something hanging brightly in the rain ­‐filled air about two miles away about two miles away some distance to the right of the direction in which he was heading he was almost completely lost convinced he was going to die of cold and wet and exhaustion and beginning to wish he could just get on with it he had just been brought an entire golfing magazine by a squirrel as well and his brain was beginning to howl and gibber seeing a huge bright image of himself light up in the sky told him that on balance he was probably right to howl and gibber but probably wrong as far as the direction he was heading was concerned taking a deep breath he turned and headed off towards the inexplicable light show ok so whats that supposed to prove demanded random it was the fact that t he image was her father that had startled her rather than the appearance of the image itself she had seen her first hologram when she was two months old and had been put in it to play she had seen her most recent one about half an hour ago playing the ma rch of the anjaqantine star guard only that its no more there or not there than the sheet was said the bird its just the interaction of water from the sky moving in one direction with light at frequencies your senses can detect moving in another it makes an apparently solid image in your mind but its all just images in the mish mash heres another one for you my mother said random no said the bird i know my mother when i see her the image was of a woman emerging from a spacecraft inside a large grey hangar ­‐like building she was being escorted by a group of tall thin purplish ­‐green creatures it was definitely randoms mother well almost definitely trillian wouldnt have been walking quite so uncertainly in low gravity or looking around her at a boring old life ­‐ support environment with quite such a disbelieving look on her face or carrying such a quaint old camera so who is it demanded random she is part of the exten t of your mother on the probability axis said the bird guide i havent the faintest idea what you mean space time and probability all have axes along which it is possible to move still dunno though i think no explain i thought you wa nted to go home explain would you like to see your home see it it was destroyed it is discontinuous along the probability axis look something very strange and wonderful now swam into view in the rain it was a huge bluish ­‐greenish glo be misty and cloud ­‐covered turning with majestic slowness against a black starry background now you see it said the bird now you dont a little less than two miles away now arthur dent stood still in his tracks he could not believe what h e could see hanging there shrouded in rain but brilliant and vividly real against the night sky ʹ the earth he gasped at the sight of it then at the moment he gasped it disappeared again then it appeared again then and this was the bit that made him give up and stick straws in his hair it turned into a sausage random was also startled by the sight of this huge blue and green and watery and misty sausage hanging above her and now it was a string of sausages or rather it was a string of sausages in which many of the sausages were missing the whole brilliant string turned and span in a bewildering dance in the air and then gradually slowed grew insubstantial and faded into the glistening darkness of the night what was that asked ra ndom in a small voice a glimpse along the probability axis of a discontinuously probable object i see most objects mutate and change along their axis of probability but the world of your origin does something slightly different it lies on what you might call a fault line in the landscape of probability which means that at many probability co ­‐ordinates the whole of it simply ceases to exist it has an inherent instability which is typical of anything that lies within what are usually designated the plural sectors make sense no want to go and see for yourself to earth yes is that possible the bird guide did not answer at once it spread its wings and with an easy grace ascended into the air and flew out into the rain which once again was beginning to lighten it soared ecstatically up into the night sky lights fla shed around it dimensions dithered in its wake it swooped and turned and looped and turned again and came at last to rest two feet in front of randoms face its wings beating slowly and silently it spoke to her again your universe is vast to you vast in time vast in space thats because of the filters through which you perceive it but i was built with no filters at all which means i perceive the mish mash which contains all possible universes but which has itself no size at all for me anyt hing is possible i am omniscient and omnipotent extremely vain and what is more i come in a handy self ­‐carrying package you have to work out how much of the above is true a slow smile spread over randoms face you bloody little thing youve be en winding me up as i said anything is possible random laughed ok she said lets try and go to earth lets go to earth at some point on its er probability axis yes where it hasnt been blown up ok so youre the guide how do we get a lift reverse engineering what reverse engineering to me the flow of time is irrelevant you decide what you want i then merely make sure that it has already happened youre joking anything is possible random frowned you ar e joking arent you let me put it another way said the bird reverse engineering enables us to shortcut all the business of waiting for one of the horribly few spaceships that passes through your galactic sector every year or so to make up its mind about whether or not it feels like giving you a lift you want a lift a ship arrives and gives you one the pilot may think he has any one of a million reasons why he has decided to stop and pick you up the real reason is that i have determined that he wi ll this is you being extremely vain isnt it little bird the bird was silent ok said random i want a ship to take me to earth will this one do it was so silent that random had not noticed the descending spaceship until it was nearly o n top of her arthur had noticed it he was a mile away now and closing just after the illuminated sausage display had drawn to its conclusion he had noticed the faint glimmerings of further lights coming down out of the clouds and had to begin with a ssumed it to be another piece of flashy son et lumière it took a moment or so for it to dawn on him that it was an actual spaceship and a moment or two longer for him to realise that it was dropping directly down to where he assumed his daughter to be that was when rain or no rain leg injury or no leg injury darkness or no darkness he suddenly started really to run he fell almost immediately slid and hurt his knee quite badly on a rock he slithered back up to his feet and tried again he had a horrible cold feeling that he was about to lose random for ever limping and cursing he ran he didnt know what it was that had been in the box but the name on it had been ford prefect and that was the name he cursed as he ran the ship was one of the sexiest and most beautiful ones that random had ever seen it was astounding silver sleek ineffable if she didnt know better she would have said it was an rw as it settled silently beside her she realised that it actually w as an rw and she could scarcely breathe for excitement an rw was the sort of thing you only saw in the sort of magazines that were designed to provoke civil unrest she was also extremely nervous the manner and timing of its arrival was deeply unsettl ing either it was the most bizarre coincidence or something very peculiar and worrying was going on she waited a little tensely for the ships hatch to open her guide ʹ she thought of it as hers now ʹ was hovering lightly over her right shoulder its wi ngs barely fluttering the hatch opened just a little dim light escaped a moment or two passed and a figure emerged he stood still for a moment or so obviously trying to accustom his eyes to the darkness then he caught sight of random standing there and seemed a little surprised he started to walk towards her then suddenly he shouted in surprise and started to run at her random was not a good person to take a run at on a dark night when she was feeling a little strung out she had unconsciously b een fingering the rock in her pocket from the moment she saw the craft coming down still running slithering hurtling bumping into trees arthur saw at last that he was too late the ship had only been on the ground for about three minutes and now s ilently gracefully it was rising up above the trees again turning smoothly in the fine speckle of rain to which the storm had now abated climbing climbing tipping up its nose and suddenly effortlessly hurtling up through the clouds gone random w as in it it was impossible for arthur to know this but he just went ahead and knew it anyway she was gone he had had his stint at being a parent and could scarcely believe how badly he had done at it he tried to continue running but his feet were dragging his knee was hurting like fury and he knew that he was too late he could not conceive that he could feel more wretched and awful than this but he was wrong he limped his way at last to the cave where random had sheltered and opened the box the ground bore the indentations of the spacecraft that had landed there only minutes before but of random there was no sign he wandered disconsolately into the cave found the empty box and piles of missing matter pellets strewn around the place he felt a little cross about that hed tried to teach her about cleaning up after herself feeling a bit cross with her about something like that helped him feel less desolate about her leaving he knew he had no means of finding her his foot knocked against som ething unexpected he bent down to pick it up and was thoroughly surprised to discover what it was it was his old hitchhikers guide to the galaxy how did that come to be in the cave he had never returned to collect it from the scene of the crash he h ad not wanted to revisit the crash and he had not wanted the guide again he had reckoned he was here on lamuella making sandwiches for good how did it come to be in the cave it was active the words on the cover flashed dont panic at him he went out of the cave again into the dim and damp moonlight he sat on a rock to have a look through the old guide and then discovered it wasnt a rock it was a person chapter arthur leapt to his feet with a start of fear it would be hard to say which he was more frightened of that he might have hurt the person he had inadvertently sat on or that the person he had inadvertently sat on would hurt him back there seemed on ins pection to be little immediate cause for alarm on the second count whoever it was he had sat on was unconscious that would probably go a great deal of the way towards explaining what he was doing lying there he seemed to be breathing ok though arthur felt his pulse that was ok as well he was lying on his side half curled up it was so long ago and far away when arthur had last done first aid that he really couldnt remember what it was he was supposed to do the first thing he was supposed to do he remembered was to have a first aid kit about his person damn should he roll him on to his back or not suppose he had any broken bones suppose he swallowed his tongue suppose he sued him who apart from anything else was he at that moment the unconscious man groaned loudly and rolled himself over arthur wondered if he should he looked at him he looked at him again he looked at him again just to make absolutely sure despite the fact that he had been thinking he was feeling about as low as he possibly could he experienced a terrible sinking feeling the figure groaned again and slowly opened his eyes it took him a while to focus then he blinked and stiffened you said ford prefect you said arthur dent ford groaned again what do you need to have explained this time he said and closed his eyes in some kind of despair five minutes later he was sitting up and rubbing the side of his head where he had quite a large swelling who the hell was that woman he said why are we surrounded by squirrels and what do they want ive been pestered by squirrels all night said arthur they keep on trying to give me magazines and stuff ford fro wned really he said and bits of rag ford thought oh he said is this near where your ship crashed yes said arthur he said it a little tightly thats probably it can happen ships cabin robots get destroyed the cyberminds that c ontrol them survive and start infesting the local wildlife can turn a whole ecosystem into some kind of helpless thrashing service industry handing out hot towels and drinks to passers ­‐by should be a law against it probably is probably also a law against there being a law against it so everybody can get nice and worked up hey ho what did you say i said and the woman is my daughter ford stopped rubbing his head say that one more time i said said arthur huffily the woman is my daught er i didnt know said ford that you had a daughter well theres probably a lot you dont know about me said arthur come to mention it theres probably a lot i dont know about me either well well well when did this happen then im not quite sure that sounds like more familiar territory said ford is there a mother involved trillian trillian i didnt think that no look its a bit embarrassing i remember she told me once she had a kid but only sort of in passing im in touch with her from time to time never seen her with the kid arthur said nothing ford started to feel the side of his head again in some bemusement are you sure this was your daughter he said tell me what happened phroo long story i was coming to pick up this parcel id sent to myself here care of you well what was that all about i think it may be something unimaginably dangerous and you sent it to me protested arthur safest place i could think of i thought i could rely on you to be absolutely boring and not open it anyway coming in at night i couldnt find this village place i was going by pretty basic information i couldnt find any signal of any kind i guess you dont have signals and stuff here thats what i like about it then i did pick up a faint signal from your old copy of the guide so i homed in on that thinking that would take me to you i found id landed in some kind of wood couldnt figure out what was going on i get out and then see this woman standing there i go up to say hello then suddenly i see that shes got this thing what thing the thing i sent you the new guide the bird thing you were meant to keep it safe you idiot but this woman had the thing right there by her shoulder i ran forward and she hit me with a rock i see said arthur what did you do well i fell over of course i was very badly hurt she and the bird started to make off towards my ship and when i say my ship i mean an rw a what an rw for zarks sake ive got this great relationship going now between my credit card and the guides central computer you would not believe that ship arthur its so an rw is a spaceship then yes its ʹ oh never mind look just get some kind of grip will you arthur or at least get some kind of catalogue at this point i was very worried and i think semi ­‐concussed i was down on my knees and bleeding prof usely so i did the only thing i could think of which was to beg i said please for zarks sake dont take my ship and dont leave me stranded in the middle of some primitive zarking forest with no medical help and a head injury i could be in serious t rouble and so could she what did she say she hit me on the head with the rock again i think i can confirm that that was my daughter sweet kid you have to get to know her said arthur she eases up does she no said arthur but you get a better sense of when to duck ford held his head and tried to see straight the sky was beginning to lighten in the west which was where the sun rose arthur didnt particularly want to see it the last thing he wanted after a hellish night like this one was some blasted day coming along and barging about the place what are yo u doing in a place like this arthur demanded ford well said arthur making sandwiches mostly what i am probably was the sandwich maker for a small tribe it was a bit embarrassing really when i first arrived that is when they rescued me from the wreckage of this super high ­‐technology spacecraft which had crashed on their planet they were very nice to me and i thought i should help them out a bit you know im an educated chap from a high ­‐technology culture i could show them a thing or two and of course i couldnt i havent got the faintest idea when it comes down to it of how anything actually works i dont mean like video ­‐recorders nobody knows how to work those i mean just something like a pen or an artesian well or somethin g not the foggiest i couldnt help at all one day i got glum and made myself a sandwich that suddenly got them all excited theyd never seen one before it was just an idea that had never occurred to them and i happen to quite like making sandwiches so it all sort of developed from there and you enjoyed that well yes i think i sort of did really getting a good set of knives that sort of thing you didnt for instance find it mind ­‐witheringly explosively astoundingly blisteringly dull well er no not as such not actually blisteringly odd i would well i suppose we have a different outlook yes like the pikka birds ford had no idea what he was talking about and couldnt be bothered to ask instead he said so how the hell do we get out of this place well i think the simplest way from here is just to follow the way down the valley to the plains probably take an hour and then walk round from there i dont think i could face going back up and over the way i came walk round where from there well back to the village i suppose arthur sighed a little forlornly i dont want to go to any blasted village snapped ford weve got to get out of here where how i dont know you tell me you live here there must be some way off this z arking planet i dont know what do you usually do sit around and wait for a passing spacecraft i suppose oh yes and how many spacecraft have visited this zark ­‐forsaken little fleapit recently well a few years ago there was mine that crashe d here by mistake then there was er trillian then the parcel delivery and now you and yes but apart from the usual suspects well er i think pretty much none so far as i know pretty quiet round here as if deliberately to prove him wr ong there was a long low distant roll of thunder ford leapt to his feet fretfully and started pacing backwards and forwards in the feeble painful light of the early dawn which lay streaked against the sky as if someone had dragged a piece of liver across it you dont understand how important this is he said what you mean my daughter out there all alone in the galaxy you think i dont can we feel sorry for the galaxy later said ford this is very very serious indeed the guide has been taken over its been bought out arthur leapt up oh very serious he shouted please fill me in straight away on some corporate publishing po litics i cant tell you how much its been on my mind of late you dont understand theres a whole new guide oh shouted arthur again oh oh oh im incoherent with excitement i can hardly wait for it to come out to find out which are the mo st exciting spaceports to get bored hanging about in some globular cluster ive never heard of please can we rush to a store thats got it right this very instant ford narrowed his eyes this is that thing you call sarcasm isnt it do you know bellowed arthur i think it is i really think it might just be a crazy little thing called sarcasm seeping in at the edges of my manner of speech ford i have had a fucking bad night will you please try and take that into account while you consider w hat fascinating bits of badger ­‐sputumly inconsequential trivia to assail me with next try to rest said ford i need to think why do you need to think cant we just sit and go budum ­‐ budumbudum with our lips for a bit couldnt we just dribble ge ntly and loll a little bit to the left for a few minutes i cant stand it ford i cant stand all this thinking and trying to work things out any more you may think that i am just standing here barking hadnt occurred to me in fact but i me an it what is the point we assume that every time we do anything we know what the consequences will be ie more or less what we intend them to be this is not only not always correct it is wildly crazily stupidly cross ­‐eyed ­‐blithering ­‐insectly wron g which is exactly my point thank you said arthur sitting down again what temporal reverse engineering arthur put his head in his hands and shook it gently from side to side is there any humane way he moaned in which i can preven t you from telling me what temporary reverse bloody ­‐whatsiting is no said ford because your daughter is caught up in the middle of it and it is deadly deadly serious thunder rolled in the pause all right said arthur tell me i leaped out of a high ­‐rise office window this cheered arthur up oh he said why dont you do it again i did hmmm said arthur disappointed obviously no good came of it the first time i managed to save myself by the most astonishing and ʹ i say this in all modesty ʹ fabulous piece of ingenious quick ­‐ thinking agility fancy footwork and self ­‐sacrifice what was the self ­‐sacrifice i jettisoned half of a much loved and i think irreplaceable pair of shoes why was that self ­‐sacrifice because they were mine said ford crossly i think we have different value systems well mines better thats according to your oh never mind so having saved yourself very cleverly once you very sensibly went and jumped again please dont tell me why just tell me what happened if you must i fell straight into the open cockpit of a passing jet tow ncar whose pilot had just accidentally pushed the eject button when he meant only to change tracks on the stereo now even i couldnt think that that was particularly clever of me oh i dont know said arthur wearily i expect you probably sneaked into his jetcar the previous night and set the pilots least favourite track to play or something no i didnt said ford just checking though oddly enough somebody else did and this is the nub you could trace the chain and branches of cruci al events and coincidences back and back turned out the new guide had done it that bird what bird you havent seen it no oh its a lethal little thing looks pretty talks big collapses waveforms selectively at will what does that m ean temporal reverse engineering oh said arthur oh yes the question is who is it really doing it for ive actually got a sandwich in my pocket said arthur delving would you like a bit yeah ok its a bit squished and sodde n im afraid never mind they munched for a bit its quite good in fact said ford whats the meat in it perfectly normal beast not come across that one so the question is ford continued who is the bird really doing it for what s the real game here mmm ate arthur when i found the bird continued ford which i did by a series of coincidences that are interesting in themselves it put on the most fantastic multi ­‐dimensional display of pyrotechnics ive ever seen it then said that it would put its services at my disposal in my universe i said thanks but no thanks it said that it would anyway whether i liked it or not i said just try it and it said it would and indeed already had done i said wed see about that an d it said that we would thats when i decided to pack the thing up and get it out of there so i sent it to you for safety oh yes whose never you mind then what with one thing and another i thought it prudent to jump out of the window again b eing fresh out of other options at the time luckily for me the jetcar was there otherwise i would have had to fall back on ingenious quick ­‐thinking agility maybe another shoe or failing all else the ground but it meant that whether i liked it or not the guide was well working for me and that was deeply worrying why because if youve got the guide you think that you are the one its working for everything went swimmingly smoothly for me from then on up to the very moment that i come up against the totty with the rock then bang im history im out of the loop are you referring to my daughter as politely as i can shes the next one in the chain who will think that everything is going fabulously for her she can beat whoever she likes around the head with bits of the landscape everything will just swim fo r her until shes done whatever shes supposed to do and then it will be all up for her too its reverse temporal engineering and clearly nobody understood what was being unleashed like me for instance what oh wake up arthur look let me try it again the new guide came out of the research labs it made use of this new technology of unfiltered perception do you know what that means look ive been making sandwiches for bobs sake whos bob never mind just carry on unfiltered perception means it perceives everything got that i dont perceive everything you dont perceive everything we have filters the new guide doesnt have any sense filters it perceives everything it wasnt a complicated technological idea it was just a question of leaving a bit out got it why dont i just say that ive got it and then you can carry on regardless right now because the bird can perceive every possible universe it is present in every possible universe yes y e e s ish so what happens is the bozos in the marketing and accounting departments say oh that sounds good doesnt that mean we only have to make one of them and then sell it an infinite number of times dont squint at me like that arthur this is how accountants think thats quite clever isnt it no it is fantastically stupid look the machines only a little guide its got some quite clever cybertechnology in it but because it has unfiltered perception any smallest move it makes has the power of a virus it can propagate throughout space time and a million other dimensions anything can be focused anywhere in any of the universes that you and i move in its power is recursive think of a computer program somewhere there is one key inst ruction and everything else is just functions calling themselves or brackets billowing out endlessly through an infinite address space what happens when the brackets collapse wheres the final end if is any of this making sense arthur sorry i was nodding off for a moment something about the universe yes something about the universe yes said ford wearily he sat down again all right he said think about this you know who i think i saw at the guide offices vogons ah i see ive said a word you understand at last arthur leapt to his feet that noise he said what noise the thunder what about it it isnt thunder its the spring migration of the perfectly normal beasts its started what are thes e animals you keep on about i dont keep on about them i just put bits of them in sandwiches why are they called perfectly normal beasts arthur told him it wasnt often that arthur had the pleasure of seeing fords eyes open wide with astonishment chapter it was a sight that arthur never quite got used to or tired of he and ford had tracked their way swiftly along the side of the small river t hat flowed down along the bed of the valley and when at last they reached the margin of the plains they pulled themselves up into the branches of a large tree to get a better view of one of the stranger and more wonderful visions that the galaxy has to of fer the great thunderous herd of thousand upon thousand of perfectly normal beasts was sweeping in magnificent array across the anhondo plain in the early pale light of the morning as the great animals charged through the fine steam of the sweat of the ir bodies mingled with the muddy mist churned up by their pounding hooves their appearance seemed a little unreal and ghostly anyway but what was heart ­‐stopping about them was where they came from and where they went to which appeared to be simply now here they formed a solid charging phalanx roughly a hundred yards wide and half a mile long the phalanx never moved except that it exhibited a slight gradual drift sideways and backwards for the eight or nine days that it regularly appeared for but t hough the phalanx stayed more or less constant the great beasts of which it was composed charged steadily at upwards of twenty miles an hour appearing suddenly from thin air at one end of the plain and disappearing equally abruptly at the other end no one knew where they came from no one knew where they went they were so important to the lives of the lamuellans it was almost as if nobody liked to ask old thrashbarg had said on one occasion that some times if you received an answer the question might be taken away some of the villagers had privately said that this was the only properly wise thing theyd ever heard thrashbarg say and after a short debate on the matter had put it down to chance the noise of the pounding of the hooves was so inten se that it was hard to hear anything else above it what did you say shouted arthur i said shouted ford this looks like it might be some kind of evidence of dimensional drift which is what shouted arthur back well a lot of people are b eginning to worry that spacetime is showing signs of cracking up with everything thats happening to it there are quite a lot of worlds where you can see how the landmasses have cracked up and moved around just from the weirdly long or meandering routes that migrating animals take this might be something like that we live in twisted times still in the absence of a decent spaceport arthur looked at him in a kind of frozen way what do you mean he said what do you mean what do i mean shou ted ford you know perfectly well what i mean were going to ride our way out of here are you seriously suggesting we try to ride a perfectly normal beast yeah see where it goes to well be killed no said arthur suddenly we wont be ki lled at least i wont ford have you ever heard of a planet called stavromula beta ford frowned dont think so he said he pulled out his own battered old copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and accessed it any funny spelling he said dont know ive only ever heard it said and that was by someone who had a mouthful of other peoples teeth you remember i told you about agrajag ford thought for a moment you mean the guy who was convinced you were getting him killed over and ov er again yes one of the places he claimed id got him killed was stavromula beta someone tries to shoot me it seems i duck and agrajag or at least one of his many reincarnations gets hit it seems that this has definitely happened at some point in time so i suppose i cant get killed at least until after ive ducked on stavromula beta only no ones ever heard of it hmm ford tried a few other searches of the hitchhikers guide but drew a blank nothing he said i was just no ive never heard of it said ford finally he wondered why it was ringing a very very faint bell though ok said arthur ive seen the way the lamuellan hunters trap perfectly normal beasts if you spear one in the herd it just gets trampled so they have to lure them out one at a time for the kill its very like the way a matador works you know with a brightly coloured cape you get one to charge at you and then step aside and execute a rather elegant swing through with the cape have you got anything like a brightly coloured cape about you this do said ford handing him his towel chapter leaping on to the back of a one ­‐and­‐a­‐half­‐ton perfectly normal beast migrating through your world at a thundering thirty miles an hour is not as easy as it might at first seem certainly it is not as easy as the lamuellan hunters made it seem and art hur dent was prepared to discover that this might turn out to be the difficult bit what he hadnt been prepared to discover however was how difficult it was even getting to the difficult bit it was the bit that was supposed to be the easy bit which tu rned out to be practically impossible they couldnt even catch the attention of a single animal the perfectly normal beasts were so intent on working up a good thunder with their hooves heads down shoulders forward back legs pounding the ground into p orridge that it would have taken something not merely startling but actually geological to disturb them the sheer amount of thundering and pending was in the end more than arthur and ford could deal with after they had spent nearly two hours prancing about doing increasingly foolish things with a medium ­‐sized floral patterned bath towel they had not managed to get even one of the great beasts thundering and pounding past them to do so much as glance casually in their direction they were within three feet of the horizontal avalanche of sweating bodies to have been much nearer would have been to risk instant death chronologic or no chronologic arthur had seen what remained of any perfectly normal beast which as the result of a clumsy misthrow by a young and inexperienced lamuellan hunter got speared while still thundering and pounding with the herd one stumble was all it took no prior appointment with death on stavromula beta wherever the hell stavromula beta was would save you or anybody else from the thunderous mangling pounding of those hooves at last arthur and ford staggered back they sat down exhausted and defeated and started to criticise each others technique with the towel youve got to flick it more complained ford you need more follow ­‐through from the elbow if youre going to get those blasted creatures to notice anything at all follow ­‐through protested arthur you need more suppleness in the wrist you need more after ­‐flourish countered ford you need a b igger towel you need said another voice a pikka bird you what the voice had come from behind them they turned and there standing behind them in the early morning sun was old thrashbarg to attract the attention of a perfectly normal be ast he said as he walked forward towards them you need a pikka bird like this from under the rough cassocky robe ­‐like thing he wore he drew a small pikka bird it sat restlessly on old thrashbargs hand and peered intently at bob knows what darti ng around about three feet six inches in front of it ford instantly went into the sort of alert crouch he liked to do when he wasnt quite sure what was going on or what he ought to do about it he waved his arms around very slowly in what he hoped was an ominous manner who is this he hissed its just old thrashbarg said arthur quietly and i wouldnt bother with all the fancy movements hes just as experienced a bluffer as you are you could end up dancing around each other all day the bird hissed ford again whats the bird its just a bird said arthur impatiently its like any other bird it lays eggs and goes ark at things you cant see or kar or rit or something have you seen one lay eggs said ford suspiciousl y for heavens sake of course i have said arthur and ive eaten hundreds of them make rather a good omelette the secret is little cubes of cold butter and then whipping it lightly with i dont want a zarking recipe said ford i just want to be sure its a real bird and not some kind of multi ­‐dimensional cybernightmare he slowly stood up from his crouched position and started to brush himself down he was still watching the bird though so said old thrashbarg to arthur is it writt en that bob shall once more take back unto himself the benediction of his once ­‐given sandwich maker ford almost went back into his crouch its all right muttered arthur he always talks like that aloud he said ah venerable thrashbarg um ye s im afraid i think im going to have to be popping off now but young drimple my apprentice will be a fine sandwich maker in my stead he has the aptitude a deep love of sandwiches and the skills he has acquired so far though rudimentary as yet wi ll in time mature and er well i think hell work out ok is what im trying to say old thrashbarg regarded him gravely his old grey eyes moved sadly he held his arms aloft one still carrying a bobbing pikka bird the other his staff o sandwich maker from bob he pronounced he paused furrowed his brow and sighed as he closed his eyes in pious contemplation life he said will be a very great deal less weird without you arthur was stunned do you know he said i th ink thats the ni cest thing any bodys ever said to me can we get on please said ford something was already happening the presence of the pikka bird at the end of thrashbargs outstretched arm was sending tremors of interest through the thundering herd the odd head flicked momentarily in their direction arthur began to remember some of the perfectly normal beast hunts he had witnessed he recalled that as well as the hunter ­‐matadors brandishing their capes there were always others standing behind them holding pikka birds he had always assumed that like him they had just come along to w atch old thrashbarg moved forward a little closer to the rolling herd some of the beasts were now tossing their heads back with interest at the sight of the pikka bird old thrashbargs outstretched arms were trembling only the pikka bird itself see med to show no interest in what was going on a few anonymous molecules of air nowhere in particular engaged all of its perky attention now exclaimed old thrashbarg at last now you may work them with the towel arthur advanced with fords towel m oving the way the hunter ­‐ matadors did with a kind of elegant strut that did not come at all naturally to him but now he knew what to do and that it was right he brandished and flicked the towel a few times to be ready for the moment and then he watche d some distance away he spotted the beast he wanted head down it was galloping towards him right on the very edge of the herd old thrashbarg switched the bird the beast looked up tossed its head and then just as its head was coming down again ar thur flourished the towel in the beasts line of sight it tossed its head again in bemusement and its eyes followed the movement of the towel he had got the beasts attention from that moment on it seemed the most natural thing to coax and draw the animal towards him its head was up cocked slightly to one side it was slowing to a canter and then a trot a few seconds later the huge thing was standing there amongst them snorting panting sweating and sniffing excitedly at the pikka bird which appeared not to have noticed its arrival at all with strange sort of sweeping movements of his arms old thrashbarg kept the pikka bird in front of the beast but always out of its reach and always downwards with strange sort of sweeping movements of the t owel arthur kept drawing the beasts attention this way and that ʹ always downwards i dont think ive ever seen anything quite so stupid in my life muttered ford to himself at last the beast dropped bemused but docile to its knees go whisp ered old thrashbarg urgently to ford go go now ford leapt up on to the great creatures back scrabbling amongst its thick knotty fur for purchase grasping great handfuls of the stuff to hold him steady once he was in position now sandwich maker go he performed some elaborate sign and ritual handshake which arthur couldnt quite get the hang of because old thrashbarg had obviously made it up on the spur of the moment then he pushed arthur forward taking a deep breath he clambered up behind ford on to the great hot heaving back of the beast and held on tight huge muscles the size of sea lions rippled and flexed beneath him old thrashbarg held the bird suddenly aloft the beasts head swivelled up to follow it thrashb arg pushed upwards and upwards repeatedly with his arms and with the pikka bird and slowly heavily the perfectly normal beast lurched up off its knees and stood at last swaying slightly its two riders held on fiercely and nervously arthur gazed out over the sea of hurtling animals straining in an attempt to see where it was they were going but there was nothing but heat haze can you see anything he said to ford no ford twisted round to glance back trying to see if there was any clue as t o where they had come from still nothing arthur shouted down at thrashbarg do you know where they come from he called or where theyre going the domain of the king shouted old thrashbarg back king shouted arthur in surprise what kin g the perfectly normal beast was swaying and rocking restlessly under him what do you mean what king shouted old thrashbarg the king its just that you never mentioned a king shouted arthur back in some consternation what shouted old thrashbarg the thrumming of a thousand hooves was very hard to hear over and the old man was concentrating on what he was doing still holding the bird aloft he led the beast slowly round till it was once more parallel with the motion of its great herd he moved forward the beast followed he moved forward again the beast followed again at last the beast was lumbering forward with a little momentum i said you never mentioned a king shouted arthur again i didnt say a king shouted old thras hbarg i said the king he drew back his arm and then hurled it forward with all his strength casting the pikka bird up into the air above the herd this seemed to catch the pikka bird completely by surprise as it had obviously not been paying any atte ntion at all to what was going on it took it a moment or two to work out what was happening then it unfurled its little wings spread them out and flew go shouted thrashbarg go and meet your destiny sandwich maker arthur wasnt so sure about wanting to meet his destiny as such he just wanted to get to wherever it was they were going so he could get back off this creature again he didnt feel at all safe up there the beast was gathering speed as it followed in the wake of the pikka bird and then it was in at the fringes of the great tide of animals and in a moment or two with its head down the pikka bird forgotten it was running with the herd again and rapidly approaching the point at which the herd was vanishing into thin air arthur an d ford held on to the great monster for dear life surrounded on all sides by hurtling mountains of bodies go ride that beast shouted thrashbarg his distant voice reverberated faintly in their ears ride that perfectly normal beast ride it ride i t ford shouted in arthurs ear where did he say we were going he said something about a king shouted arthur in return holding on desperately what king thats what i said he just said the king i didnt know there was a the king sho uted ford nor did i shouted arthur back except of course for the king shouted ford and i dont suppose he meant him what king shouted arthur the point of exit was almost upon them just ahead of them perfectly normal beasts were gallop ing into nothingness and vanishing what do you mean what king shouted ford i dont know what king im only saying that he couldnt possibly mean the king so i dont know what he means ford i dont know what youre talking about so said ford then with a sudden rush the stars came on turned and twisted around their heads and then just as suddenly turned off again chapter misty grey buildings loomed and flickered they bounced up and down in a highly embarrassing way what sort of buildings were they what were they for what did they remind her of its so difficult to know what things are supposed to be when you suddenly turn up unexpectedly on a different world which has a different culture a different set of the most basic assumptions about life and also incredibly dull and meaningless architecture the sky above the buildings was a cold and hostile black the stars which should have been blindingly brilliant points of light this far from the sun were bl urred and dulled by the thickness of the huge shielding bubble perspex or something like it something dull and heavy anyway tricia wound the tape back again to the beginning she knew there was something slightly odd about it well in fact there we re about a million things that were slightly odd about it but there was one that was nagging at her and she hadnt quite got it she sighed and yawned as she waited for the tape to rewind she cleared away some of the dirty polystyrene coffee cups that had accumulated on the editing desk and tipped them into the bin she was sitting in a small editing suite at a video production company in soho she had do not disturb notices plastered all over the door and a block on all incoming calls at the switch ­‐board this was originally to protect her astonishing scoop but now it was to protect her from embarrassment she would watch the tape all the way through again from the beginning if she could bear to she might do some fast forwarding here and there it was about four oclock on monday afternoon and she had a kind of sick feeling she was trying to work out what the cause of this slightly sick feeling was and there was no shortage of candidates first of all it had all come on top of the overnight flight from new york the red eye always a killer that then being accosted by aliens on her lawn and flown to the planet rupert she was not sufficiently experienced in that sort of thing to be able to say for sure that that was always a killer but she would be prepared to bet that those who went through it regularly cursed it there were always stress charts being published in magazines fifty stress points for losing your job seventy ­‐five points for a divorce or changing your hairstyle and so on none of them ever mentioned being accosted on your lawn by aliens and then being flown to the planet rupert but she was sure it was worth a few dozen points it wasnt that the journey had been particularly stressful it had been extremely dull in fact certainly it had been no more stressful than the trip she had just taken across the atlantic and it had taken roughly the same time about seven hours well that was pretty astounding wasnt it flying to the outer limits of the solar system in the same t ime that it took to fly to new york meant they must have some fantastic unheard ­‐of form of propulsion in the ship she quizzed her hosts about it and they agreed that it was pretty good but how does it work she had demanded excitedly she was still quite excited at the beginning of the trip she found that part of the tape and played it through to herself the grebulons which is what they called themselves were politely showing her which buttons they pressed to make the ship go yes but what principle does it work on she heard herself demand from behind the camera oh you mean is it something like a warp drive or something like that they said yes persisted tricia what is it it probably is something of the kind they said like what warp drive photon drive something like that youd have to ask the flight engineer which one is he we dont know we have all lost our minds you see oh yes said tricia a little faintly so you said um how did you lose your minds exactly then we dont know they said patiently because youve lost your minds echoed tricia glumly would you like to watch television it is a long flight we watch television it is something we enjoy all of t his riveting stuff was on the tape and fine viewing it made first of all the picture quality was extremely poor tricia didnt know why this was exactly she had a feeling that the grebulons responded to a slightly different range of light frequencies and that there had been a lot of ultra ­‐violet around which was mucking up the video camera there were a lot of interference patterns and video snow as well probably something to do with the warp drive that none of them knew the first thing about so wha t she had on tape essentially was a bunch of slightly thin and discoloured people sitting around watching televisions that were showing network broadcasts she had also pointed the camera out of the very tiny viewport near her seat and got a nice slight ly streaky effect of stars she knew it was real but it would have taken a good three or four minutes to fake in the end she had decided to save her precious videotape for rupert itself and had simply sat back and watched television with them she had e ven dozed off for a while so part of her sick feeling came from the sense that she had had all that time in an alien spacecraft of astounding technological design and had spent most of it dozing in front of reruns of mash and cagney and lacey but what else was there to do she had taken some photos as well of course all of which had subsequently turned out to be badly fogged when she got them back from the chemist another part of her sick feeling probably came from the landing on rupert this at least had been dramatic and hair­‐raising the ship had come sweeping in over a dark and sombre landscape a terrain so desperately far removed from the heat and light of its parent sun that it seemed like a map of the psychological scars on the mind of an abandoned child lights bla zed through the frozen darkness and guided the ship into the mouth of some kind of cave that seemed to bend itself open to accept the small craft unfortunately because of the angle of their approach and the depth at which the small thick viewport was s et into the crafts skin it hadnt been possible to get the video camera to point directly at any of it she ran through that bit of the tape the camera was pointing directly at the sun this is normally very bad for a video camera but when the sun is roughly a third of a billion miles away it doesnt do any harm in fact it hardly makes any impression at all you just get a small point of light right in the middle of the frame which could be just about anything it was just one star in a multitude tricia fast ­‐forwarded ah now the next bit had been quite promising they had emerged out of the ship into a vast grey hangar ­‐like structure this was clearly alien technology on a dramatic scale huge grey buildings under the dark canopy of the persp ex bubble these were the same buildings that she had been looking at the end of the tape she had taken more footage of them while leaving rupert a few hours later just as she was about to reboard the spacecraft for the journey home what did they remind her of well as much as anything else they reminded her of a film set from just about any low ­‐budget science ­‐fiction movie of the last twenty years a lot larger of course but it all looked thoroughly tawdry and unconvincing on the video screen apart from the dreadful picture quality she had been struggling with the unexpected effects of gravity that was appreciably lower than that on earth and she had found it very hard to keep the camera from bouncing around in an embarrassingly unprofessional way it was therefore impossible to make out any detail and now here was the leader coming forward to greet her smiling and sticking his hand out that was all he was called the leader none of the grebulons had names largely because they couldnt think of any tricia discovered that some of them had thought of calling themselves after characters from television programmes they had picked up from earth but hard as they had tried to call each other wayne and bobby and chuck some remnant of something lurking deep in the cultural subconscious they had brought with them from the distant stars which were their homes must have told them that this really wasnt right and wouldnt do the leader had looked pretty much like all the others possibly a bit less t hin he said how much he enjoyed her shows on tv that he was her greatest fan how glad he was that she had been able to come along and visit them on rupert and how much everybody had been looking forward to her coming how he hoped the flight had been comfortable and so on there was no particular sense she could detect of being any kind of emissary from the stars or anything certainly watching it now on videotape he just looked like some guy in costume and make ­‐up standing in front of a set that wou ldnt hold up too well if you leant against it she sat staring at the screen with her face cradled in her hands and shaking her head in slow bewilderment this was awful not only was this bit awful but she knew what was coming next it was the bit where the leader asked if she was hungry after the flight and would she perhaps like to come and have something to eat they could discuss things over a little dinner she coul d remember what she was thinking at this point alien food how was she going to deal with it would she actually have to eat it would she have access to some sort of paper napkin she could spit stuff out into wouldnt there be all sorts of different ial immunity problems it turned out to be hamburgers not only did it turn out to be hamburgers but the hamburgers it turned out to be were very clearly and obviously mcdonalds hamburgers which had been reheated in a microwave it wasnt just the look of them it wasnt just the smell it was the polystyrene clamshell packages they came in which had mcdonalds printed all over them eat enjoy said the leader nothing is too good for our honoured guest this was in his private apartment trici a had looked around it in bewilderment that had bordered on fear but had nevertheless got it all on videotape the apartment had a waterbed in it and a midi hi ­‐fi and one of those tall electrically illuminated glass things which sit on table tops and ap pear to have large globules of sperm floating about in them the walls were covered in velvet the leader lounged against a brown corduroy bean bag and squirted breath ­‐freshener into his mouth tricia began to feel very scared suddenly she was further from earth than any human being to her knowledge had ever been and she was with an alien creature who was lounging against a brown corduroy bean bag and squirting breath ­‐freshener into his mouth she didnt want to make any false moves she didnt wan t to alarm him but there were things she had to know how did you where did you get this she asked gesturing around the room nervously the decor asked the leader do you like it it is very sophisticated we are a sophisticated people w e grebulons we buy sophisticated consumer durables by mail order tricia had nodded tremendously slowly at this point mail order she had said the leader chuckled it was one of those dark chocolate reassuring silky chuckles i think you th ink they ship it here no ha ha we have arranged a special box number in new hampshire we make regular pick ­‐up visits ha ha he lounged back in a relaxed fashion on his bean bag reached for a reheated french fry and nibbled the end of it an amused s mile playing across his lips tricia could feel her brain beginning to bubble very slightly she kept the video camera going how do you well er how do you pay for these wonderfulthings the leader chuckled again american express he said w ith a nonchalant shrug tricia nodded slowly again she knew that they gave cards exclusively to just about anybody and these she said holding up the hamburger he had presented her with it is very easy said the leader we stand in line again tricia realised with a cold trickling feeling going down her spine that explained an awful lot she hit the fast forward button again there was nothing of any use here at all it was all nightmarish madness she could have faked something that would have looked more convincing another sick feeling began to creep over her as she watched this hopeless awful tape and she began with slow horror to realise that it must be the answer she must be she shook her head and tried to get a grip an overnight flight going east the sleeping pills she had taken to get her through it the vodka shed had to set the sleeping pills going what else well there was seventeen years of obsession that a glamorous man with two heads one of which was di sguised as a parrot in a cage had tried to pick her up at a party but had then impatiently flown off to another planet in a flying saucer there suddenly seemed to be all sorts of bothersome aspects to that idea that had never really occurred to her neve r occurred to her in seventeen years she stuffed her fist into her mouth she must get help then there had been eric bartlett banging on about alien spacecraft landing on her lawn and before that new york had been well very hot and stressful t he high hopes and the bitter disappointment the astrology stuff she must have had a nervous breakdown that was it she was exhausted and she had had a nervous breakdown and had started hallucinating some time after she got home she had dreamt the who le story an alien race of people dispossessed of their own lives and histories stuck on a remote outpost of our solar system and filling their cultural vacuum with our cultural junk ha it was natures way of telling her to check into an expensive medic al establishment very quickly she was very very sick she looked at how many large coffees shed got through as well and realised how heavily she was breathing and how fast part of solving any problem she told herself was realising that you had it she started to bring her breathing under control she had caught herself in time she had seen where she was she was on the way back from whatever psychological precipice she had been on the brink of she started to calm down to calm down to calm down she sat back in the chair and closed her eyes after a while now that she was breathing normally again she opened them again so where had she got this tape from then it was still running all right it was a fake she had faked it herself that was it it must have been her who had faked it because her voice was all over the soundtrack asking questions every now and then the camera would swing down at the end of a shot and she would see her own feet in her own shoes she had faked it and she had no recollection of faking it or any idea of why she had done it her breathing was getting hectic again as she watched the snowy flickering screen she must still be hallucinating she shook her head trying to make it go away she had no memo ry of faking any of this very obviously fake stuff on the other hand she did seem to have memories that were very like the faked stuff she continued to watch in a bewildered trance the person she imagined to be called the leader was questioning her ab out astrology and she was answering smoothly and calmly only she could detect the well ­‐disguised rising panic in her own voice the leader pushed a button and a maroon velvet wall slid aside revealing a large bank of flat tv monitors each of the monitors was showing a kaleidoscope of different images a few seconds from a game show a few seconds from a cop show a few seconds from a supermarket warehouse security system a few seconds from somebodys holiday movies a few seconds of s ex a few seconds of news a few seconds of comedy it was clear that the leader was very proud of all this stuff and he was waving his hands like a conductor while continuing at the same time to talk complete gibberish another wave of his hands and all the screens cleared to form one giant computer screen showing in diagrammatic form all the planets of the solar system and mapped out against a background of the stars in their constellations the display was completely static we have great skills th e leader was saying great skills in computation in cosmological trigonometry in three ­‐dimensional navigational calculus great skills great great skills only we have lost them it is too bad we like to have skills only they have gone they are in s pace somewhere hurtling with our names and the details of our homes and loved ones please he said gesturing her forward to sit at the computers console be skilful for us obviously what happened next was that tricia quickly set the video camera up on its tripod to capture the whole scene she then walked into shot herself and sat down calmly in front of the giant computer display spent a few moments familiarising herself with the interface and then started smoothly and competently to pretend tha t she had the faintest idea what she was doing it hadnt been that difficult in fact she was after all a mathematician and astrophysicist by training and a television presenter by experience and what science she had forgotten over the years she was more than capable of making up by bluffing the computer she was working on was clear evidence that the grebulons came from a far more advanced and sophisticated culture than their current vacuous state suggested and with its aid she was able within ab out half an hour to cobble together a rough working model of the solar system it wasnt particularly accurate or anything but it looked good the planets were whizzing around in reasonably good simulations of their orbits and you could watch the movem ent of the whole piece of virtual cosmological clockwork from any point within the system ʹ very roughly you could watch from earth you could watch from mars etc you could watch from the surface of the planet rupert tricia had been quite impressed wit h herself but also very impressed with the computer system she was working on using a computer workstation on earth the task would probably have taken a year or so of programming when she was finished the leader came up behind her and watched he was very pleased and delighted with what she had achieved good he said and now please i would like you to demonstrate how to use the system you have just designed to translate the information in this book for me quietly he put a book down in front of her it was you and your planets by gail andrews tricia stopped the tape again she was definitely feeling very wobbly indeed the feeling that she was hallucinating had now receded but had not left anything any easier or clearer in her head she pushed her seat back from the editing desk and wondered what to do years ago she had left the field of astronomical research because she knew without any doubt whatsoever that she had met a being from another planet at a party and she had also known without any doubt whatsoever that she would have made herself a laughing stock if she had ever said so but how could she study cosmology and not say anything about the single most important thing she knew about it she had done the only thing she could do she had left now she worked in television and the same thing had happened again she had videotape actual videotape of the most astounding story in the history of well anything a forgotten outpost of an alien civilisation marooned on the outermos t planet of our own solar system she had the story she had been there she had seen it she had the videotape for gods sake and if she ever showed it to anybody she would be a laughing stock how could she prove any of this it wasnt even worth thinking about the whole thing was a nightmare from virtually any angle she cared to look at it from her head was beginning to throb she had some aspirin in her bag she went out of the little editi ng suite to the water dispenser down the corridor she took the aspirin and drank several cups of water the place seemed to be very quiet usually there were more people bustling about the place or at least some people bustling around the place she pop ped her head round the door of the editing suite next to hers but there was no one there she had gone rather overboard keeping people out of her own suite do not disturb the notice read do not even think of entering i dont care what it is go away im busy when she went back in she noticed that the message light on her phone extens ion was winking and wondered how long it had been on hello she said to the receptionist oh miss mcmillan im so glad you called everybodys been trying to reach you your tv company theyre desperate to reach you can you call them why did nt you put them through said tricia you said i wasnt to put anybody through for anything you said i was to deny that you were even here i didnt know what to do i came up to give you a message but ok said tricia cursing herself she pho ned her office tricia where the haemorrhaging fuck are you at the editing they said i know whats up whats up only a bloody alien spaceship what where regents park big silver job some girl with a bird she speaks english and throws rocks at people and wants someone to repair her watch just get there tricia stared at it it wasnt a grebulon ship not that she was suddenly an expert on extraterrestrial craft but this was a sleek and beautiful silver and white thi ng about the size of a large ocean ʹ going yacht which is what it most resembled next to this the structures of the huge half ­‐ dismantled grebulon ship looked like gun turrets on a battleship gun turrets thats what those blank grey buildings had looke d like and what was odd about them was that by the time she passed them again on her way to reboarding the small grebulon craft they had moved these things flitted briefly through her head as she ran from the taxi to meet her camera crew wheres the girl she shouted above the noise of helicopters and police sirens there shouted the producer while the sound engineer hurried to clip a radio mike to her she says her mother and father came from here in some parallel dimension or something like th at and shes got her fathers watch and i dont know what can i tell you busk it ask her what it feels like to be from outer space thanks a lot ted muttered tricia checked that her mike was securely clipped gave the engineer some level to ok a deep breath tossed her hair back and switched into her role of professional reporter on home ground ready for anything at least nearly anything she turned to look for the girl that must be her with the wild hair and wild eyes the girl turne d towards her and stared mother she screamed and started to hurl rocks at tricia chapter daylight exploded around them hot heavy sun a desert plain stretched out ahead in a haze of heat they thundered out into it jump shouted ford prefect what shouted arthur dent holding on for dear life there was no reply what did you say shouted arthur again and then realised that ford prefect was no longer there he looked around in panic and started to slip re alising he couldnt hold on any longer he pushed himself sideways as hard as he could and rolled into a ball as he hit the ground rolling rolling away from the pounding hooves what a day he thought as he started furiously coughing dust up out of his lungs he hadnt had a day as bad as this since the earth had been blown up he staggered up to his knees and then up to his feet and started to run away he didnt know what from or what to but running away seemed a prudent move he ran straight into f ord prefect who was standing there surveying the scene look said ford that is precisely what we need arthur coughed up some more dust and wiped some other dust out of his hair and eyes he turned panting to look at what ford was looking at it didnt look much like the domain of a king or the king or any kind of king it looked quite inviting though first the context this was a desert world the dusty earth was packed hard and had neatly bruised every last bit of arthur that hadnt alrea dy been bruised by the festivities of the previous night some way ahead of them were great cliffs that looked like sandstone eroded by the wind and what little rain presumably fell in those parts into wild and fantastic shapes which matched the fantasti c shapes of the giant cacti that sprouted here and there from the arid orange landscape for a moment arthur dared to hope they had unexpectedly arrived in arizona or new mexico or maybe south dakota but there was plenty of evidence that this was not th e case the perfectly normal beasts for a start still thundering still pounding they swept up in their tens of thousands from the far horizon disappeared completely for about half a mile then swept off thundering and pounding to the distant horizon opposite then there were the spaceships parked in front of the bar grill ah the domain of the king bar grill bit of an anti ­‐climax thought arthur to himself in fact only one of the spaceships was parked in front of the domain of the king bar grill the other three were in a parking lot by the side of the bar and grill it was the one in front that caught the eye though wonderful looking thing wild fins all over it far far too much chrome all over the fins and most of the actual bodywork painted in a shocking pink it crouched there like an immense brooding insect and looked as if it was at any moment about to jump on something about a mile away the domain of the king bar grill was slap bang in the middle of where the perfectly normal beasts would be charging if they didnt take a minor transdimensional diversion on the way it stood on its own undisturbed an ordinary bar grill a truckstop diner somewhere in the middle of nowhere quiet the domain of the king gonna buy that sp aceship said ford quietly buy it said arthur thats not like you i thought you usually pinched them sometimes you have to show a little respect said ford probably have to show a little cash as well said arthur how the hell much is th at thing worth with a tiny movement ford brought his dine ­‐o­‐charge credit card up out of his pocket arthur noticed that the hand holding it was trembling very slightly ill teach them to make me the restaurant critic breathed ford what do yo u mean asked arthur ill show you said ford with a nasty glint in his eye lets go and run up a few expenses shall we couple beers said ford and i dunno a couple bacon rolls whatever you got oh and that pink thing outside he flipp ed his card on the top of the bar and looked around casually there was a kind of silence there hadnt been a lot of noise before but there was definitely a kind of silence now even the distant thunder of the perfectly normal beasts carefully avoiding the domain of the king seemed suddenly a little muted just rode into town said ford as if nothing was odd about that or about anything else he was leaning against the bar at an extravagantly relaxed angle there were about three other customers in the place sitting at tables nursing beers about three some people would say there were ex actly three but it wasnt that kind of a place not the kind of a place that you felt like being that specific in there was some big guy setting up some stuff on the little stage as well old drum kit couple guitars country and western kind of stuff the barman was not moving very swiftly to get in fords order in fact he wasnt moving at all not sure that the pink things for sale he said at last in the kind of accent that went on for quite a long time sure it is said ford how much you wa nt well think of a number ill double it taint mine to sell said the barman so whose the barman nodded at the big guy setting up on the stage big fat guy moving slow balding ford nodded he grinned ok he said get the b eers get the rolls keep the tab open arthur sat at the bar and rested he was used to not knowing what was going on he felt comfortable with it the beer was pretty good and made him a little sleepy which he didnt mind at all the bacon rolls were not bacon rolls they were perfectly normal beast rolls he exchanged a few professional roll ­‐making remarks with the barman and just let ford get on with whatever ford wanted to do ok said ford returning to his stool its cool we got the pink thing the barman was very surprised hes selling it to you hes giving it to us for free said ford taking a gnaw at his roll hey no keep the tab open though we have some items to add to it good roll he took a deep pull of beer good bee r he added good ship too he said eying the big pink and chrome insect ­‐like thing bits of which could be seen through the windows of the bar good everything pretty much you know he said sitting back reflectively its at times like this that you kind of wonder if its worth worrying about the fabric of spacetime and the causal integrity of the multi ­‐dimensional probability matrix and the potential collapse of all wave forms in the whole sort of general mish mash and all that sort of stuff th ats been bugging me maybe i feel that what the big guy says is right just let it all go what does it matter let it go which big guy said arthur ford just nodded towards the stage the big guy was saying one two into the mike a couple of time s couple other guys were on the stage now drums guitar the barman who had been silent for a moment or two said you say hes letting you have his ship yeah said ford let it all go is what he said take the ship take it with my blessing be good to her i will he good to her he took a pull at his beer again like i was saying he went on its at times like this that you kind of think let it all go but then you think of guys like infinidim enterprises and you think they are not goi ng to get away with it they are going to suffer it is my sacred and holy duty to see those guys suffer here let me put something on the tab for the singer i asked for a special request and we agreed its to go on the tab ok ok said the barman cautiously then he shrugged ok however you want to do it how much ford named a figure the barman fell over amongst the bottles and glasses ford vaulted quickly over the bar to check that he was all right and help him back up to his feet hed cut his finger and his elbow a bit and was feeling a little woozy but was oth erwise fine the big guy started to sing the barman hobbled off with fords credit card to get authorisation is there stuff going on here that i dont know about said arthur to ford isnt there usually said ford no need to be like that said arthur he began to wake up shouldnt we be going he said suddenly will that ship get us to earth sure will said ford thats where random will be going said arthur with a start we can follow her but er ford let arthur get on with thinking things out for himself while he got out his old edition of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy but where are we on the probability axis thing said arthur will the earth be there or not there i spent so much tim e looking for it all i found was planets that were a bit like it or not at all like it though it was clearly the right place because of the continents the worst version was called nowwhat where i got bitten by some wretched little animal thats how the y communicated you know by biting each other bloody painful then half the time of course the earth isnt even there because its been blown up by the bloody vogons how much sense am i making ford didnt comment he was listening to something he passed the guide over to arthur and pointed at the screen the active entry read earth mostly harmless you mean its there said arthur excitedly the earth is there thats where random will be going the bird was showing her the earth in the rain storm ford motioned arthur to shout a little less loudly he was listening arthur was growing impatient hed heard bar singers sing love me tender before he was a bit surprised to hear it here right in the middle of wherever the hell this was ce rtainly not earth but then things tended not to surprise him these days as much as formerly the singer was quite good as bar singers went if you liked that sort of thing but arthur was getting fretful he glanced at his watch this only served to rem ind him that he didnt have his watch any more random had it or at least the remains of it dont you think we should be going he said insistently shhh said ford i paid to hear this song he seemed to have tears in his eyes which arthur fou nd a bit disturbing hed never seen ford moved by anything other than very very strong drink probably the dust he waited tapping his fingers irritably out of time with the music the song ended the singer went on to do heartbreak hotel anyway ford whispered ive got to review the restaurant what i have to write a review write a review of this place filing the review validates the expenses claim ive fixed it so that it happens completely automatically and untraceably this bill is going to need some validation he added quietly staring into his beer with a nasty smirk for a couple of beers and a roll and a tip for the singer why how much did you tip him ford named a figure again i dont know how much tha t is said arthur whats it worth in pounds sterling what would it buy you it would probably buy you roughly er ford screwed his eyes up as he did some calculations in his head switzerland he said at last he picked up his hitchhikers guide and started to type arthur nodded intelligently there were times when he wished he understood what on earth ford was talking about and other times like now when he felt it was probably safer not even to try he looked over fords shoulder thi s isnt going to take long is it he said nah said ford piece of piss just mention that the rolls were quite good the beer good and cold local wildlife nicely eccentric the bar singer the best in the known universe and thats about it doesn t need much just a validation he touched an area on the screen marked enter and the message vanished into the sub ­‐etha you thought the singer was pretty good then yeah said ford the barman was returning with a piece of paper which seemed to be trembling in his hand he pushed it over to ford with a kind of nervous reverential twitch funny thing said the barman the system rejected it first couple times cant say it surprised me beads of sweat were standing on his brow then suddenly its oh yeah thats ok and the system er validates it just like that you wannasign it ford scanned the form quickly he sucked his teeth this is going to hurt infinidim a lot he said with an appearance of concern oh well he added softly screw em he signed with a flourish and handed it back to the barman more money he said than the colonel made for him in an entire career of doing crap m ovies and casino gigs just for doing what he does best standing up and singing in a bar and he negotiated it himself i think this is a good moment for him tell him i said thanks and buy him a drink he tossed a few coins on the bar the barman pushed them away i dont think thats necessary he said slightly hoarsely tis to me said ford ok we are outa here they stood out in the heat and the dust and looked at the big pink and chrome thing with amazement and admiration or at least fo rd looked at it with amazement and admiration arthur just looked at it you dont think its a bit overdone do you he said it again when they climbed inside it the seats and quite a lot of the controls were covered in fine fur skin or suede there was a big gold monogram on the main control panel which just read ep you know said ford as he fired up the ships engines i asked him if it was true that he had been abducted by aliens and you know what he said who said arthur the king which king oh weve had this conversation havent we never mind said ford for what its worth he said no he went of his own accord im still not sure who were talking about said arthur ford shook his head look he said there a re some tapes over in the compartment to your left why dont you choose some music and put it on ok said arthur and flipped through the cartons do you like elvis presley he said yeah i do as a matter of fact said ford now i hope this machine can leap like it looks like it can he engaged the main drive yeeehaah shouted ford as they shot upwards at face ­‐tearing speed it could chapter the news networks dont like this kind of thing they regard it as a waste an incontrovertible spaceship arrives out of nowhere in the middle of london and it is sensational news of the highest magnitude another completely different one arrives three and a half hours later and somehow it isnt another spacecraft said the headlines and news stand billboards this ones pink a couple of months later they could have made a lot more of it the third spacecraft half an hour after that the little four berth hrundi runabout only made it on to the local news ford and arthur had come screaming down out of the stratosphere and parked neatly on portland place it was just after six ­‐thirty in the evening and there were spaces free they mingled briefly wi th the crowd that gathered round to ogle then said loudly that if no one else was going to call the police they would and made good their escape home said arthur a husky tone creeping into his voice as he gazed misty ­‐eyed around him oh dont get all maudlin on me snapped ford we have to find your daughter and we have to find that bird thing how said arthur this is a planet of five and a half billion people and yes said ford but only one of them has just arrived from oute r space in a large silver spaceship accompanied by a mechanical bird i suggest we just find a television and something to drink while we watch it we need some serious room service they checked into a large two ­‐bedroomed suite at the langham mysterious ly fords dine ­‐o­‐charge card issued on a planet over five thousand light years away seemed to present the hotels computer with no problems ford hit the phones straight away while arthur attempted to locate the television ok said ford i want to order up some margaritas please couple of pitchers couple of chefs salads and as much foie gras as youve got and also london zoo shes on the news shouted arthur from the next room thats what i said said ford into the phone london zoo just charge it to the room shes good god shouted arthur do you know who shes being interviewed by are you having difficulty understanding the english language continued ford its the zoo just up the road from here i dont care if its closed this evening i dont want to buy a ticket i just want to buy the zoo i dont care if youre busy this is room service im in a room and i want some service got a piece of paper ok heres what i want you to do all the animals that can be s afely returned to the wild return them set up some good teams of people to monitor their progress in the wild see that theyre doing ok its trillian shouted arthur or is it er god i cant stand all this parallel universe stuff its so b loody confusing it seems to be a different trillian its tricia mcmillan which is what trillian used to be called before er why dont you come and watch see if you can figure it out just a second ford shouted and returned to his negotiation s with room service then well need some natural reserves for the animals that cant hack it in the wild he said set up a team to work out the best places to do that we might need to buy somewhere like zaire and maybe some islands madagascar baffi n sumatra those kind of places well need a wide variety of habitats look i dont see why youre seeing this as a problem learn to delegate hire whoever you want get on to it i think youll find my credit is good and blue cheese dressing on the s alad thank you he put the phone down and went through to arthur who was sitting on the edge of his bed watching television i ordered us some foie gras said ford what said arthur whose attention was entirely focused on the television i said i ordered us some foie gras oh said arthur vaguely um i always feel a hit bad about foie gras bit cruel to the geese isnt it fuck em said ford slumping on the bed you cant care about every damn thing well thats all very wel l for you to say but drop it said ford if you dont like it ill have yours whats happening chaos said arthur complete chaos random keeps on screaming at trillian or tricia or whoever it is that she abandoned her and then demanding to go to a good night club tricias broken down in tears and says shes never even met random let alone given birth to her then she suddenly started howling about someone called rupert and said that he had lost his mind or something i didnt quite follo w that bit to be honest then random started throwing stuff and theyve cut to a commercial break while they try and sort it all out oh theyve just cut back to the studio shut up and watch a rather shaken anchorman appeared on the screen and apolog ised to viewers for the disruption of the previous item he said he didnt have any very clear news to report only that the mysterious girl who called herself random frequent flyer dent had left the studio to er rest tricia mcmillan would be he hoped back tomorrow meanwhile fresh reports of ufo activity were coming in ford leaped up off the bed grabbed the nearest phone and jabbed at a number concierge you want to own the hotel its yours if you can find out for me in five minutes which clubs tricia mcmillan belongs to just charge the whole thing to this room chapter away in the inky depths of space invisible movements were bein g made invisible to any of the inhabitants of the strange and temperamental plural zone at the focus of which lay the infinitely multitudinous possibilities of the planet called earth but not inconsequential to them at the very edge of the solar syste m hunkered down on a green leatherette sofa staring fretfully at a range of tv and computer screens sat a very worried grebulon leader he was fiddling with stuff fiddling with his book on astrology fiddling with the console of his computer fiddling w ith the displays being fed through to him constantly from all of the grebulons monitoring devices all of them focused on the planet earth he was distressed their mission was to monitor but to monitor secretly he was a bit fed up with his mission to be honest he was fairly certain that his mission must have been to do more than sit around watching tv for years on end they certainly had a lot of other equipment with them that must have had some purpose if only they hadnt accidentally lost all trace of their purpose he needed a sense of purpose in life which was why he had turned to astrology to fill the yawning gulf that existed in the middle of his mind and soul that would tell him something surely well it was telling him something it was t elling him as far as he could make out that he was about to have a very bad month that things were going to go from bad to worse if he didnt get a grip on things and start making some positive moves and thinking things out for himself it was true it was very clear from his star chart which he had worked out using his astrology book and the computer program which that nice tricia mcmillan had designed for him to re ­‐triangulate all the appropriate astronomical data earth ­‐based astrology had to be entirely recalculated to yield results that were meaningful to the grebulons here on the tenth planet out on the frozen edges of the solar system the recalculations showed absolutely clearly and unamhiguously that he was going to have a very b ad month indeed starting with today because today earth was starting to rise into capricorn and that for the grebulon leader who showed all the character signs of being a classic taurus was very bad indeed now was the time his horoscope said for taking positive actions making tough decisions seeing what needed to be done and doing it this was all very difficult for him but he knew that nobody ever said that doing tough stuff wasnt tough the computer was already tracking and predicting the se cond ­‐by­‐second location of the planet earth he ordered the great grey turrets to swivel because all of the grebulon surveillance equipment was focused on the planet earth it failed to spot that there was now another source of data in the solar system its chances of spotting this other source of data ʹ a massive yellow constructor ship ʹ accidentally were practically nil it was as far from the sun as rupert was but almost diametrically opposite almost hidden by the sun almost the massive yellow constructor ship wanted to be able to monitor events on planet ten without being spotted itself it had managed this very successfully there were all sorts of other ways in which this ship was diametrically opposite to the grebulons its leader its ca ptain had a very clear idea of what his purpose was it was a very simple and plain one and he had been pursuing it in his simple plain way for a considerable period of time now anyone who knew of his purpose might have said that it was a pointless and ugly one that it wasnt the sort of purpose that enhanced a life put a spring in a persons step made birds sing and flowers bloom rather the reverse in fact absolutely the reverse it wasnt his job to worry about that though it was his job to do his job which was to do his job if that led to a certain narrowness of vision and circularity of thought then it wasnt his job to worry about such things any such things that came his way were referred to others who had in turn other people to refer such things to many many light years from here indeed from anywhere lies the grim and long ab andoned planet vogsphere some where on a fetid fog­‐bound mud bank on this planet there stands surrounded by the dirty broken and empty carapaces of the l ast few jeweled scuttling crabs a small stone monument which marks the place where it is thought the species vogon vogonblurtus first arose on the monument there is carved an arrow which points away into the fog under which are inscribed in plain sim ple letters the words the buck stops there deep in the bowels of his unsightly yellow ship the vogon captain grunted as he reached for a slightly faded and dog ­‐eared piece of paper that lay in front of him a demolition order if you were to unravel exactly where the captains job which was to do his job which was to do his job actually began then it all came down at last to this piece of paper that had been issued to him by his immediate superior long ago the piece of paper had an instruction on it and his purpose was to carry out that instruction and put a little tick mark in the adjacent box when he had carried it out he had carried out the instruction once before but a number of troublesome circumstances had prevented him from being able to put the tick in the little box one of the troublesome circumstances was the plural nature of this galactic sector where the possible continually interfered with the probable simple demolition didnt get you any further than push ing down a bubble under a badly hung strip of wallpaper anything you demolished kept on popping up again that would soon be taken care of another was a small bunch of people who continually refused to be where they were supposed to be when they were su pposed to be there that also would soon be taken care of the third was an irritating and anarchic little device called the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy that was now well and truly taken care of and in fact through the phenomenal power of tempor al reverse engineering it was now itself the agency through which everything else would be taken care of the captain had merely come to watch the final act of this drama he himself did not have to lift a finger show me he said the shadowy shape o f a bird spread its wings and rose into the air near him darkness engulfed the bridge dim lights danced briefly in the black eyes of the bird as deep in its instructional address space bracket after bracket was finally closing if clauses were finally ending repeat loops halting recursive functions calling themselves for the last few times a brilliant vision lit up in the darkness a watery blue and green vision a tube flowing through the air shaped like a chopped up string of sausages with a fl atulent noise of satisfaction the vogon captain sat back to watch chapter just there number forty ­‐two shouted ford prefect to the taxi ­‐ driver right here the taxi lurched to a halt and ford and arthur jumped out they had stopped at qu ite a number of cash ­‐dispensers on the way and ford chucked a fistful of money through the window at the driver the entrance to the club was dark smart and severe only the smallest little plaque bore its name members knew where it was and if you wer ent a member then knowing where it was wasnt any help to you ford prefect was not a member of stavros though he had once been to stavros other club in new york he had a very simple method of dealing with establishments of which he was not a member he simply swept in as soon as the door was opened pointed back at arthur and said its ok hes with me he bounded down the dark glossy stairs feeling very froody in his new shoes they were suede and they were blue and he was very pleased that in spite of everything else going on he had been sharp ­‐ eyed enough to spot them in a shop window from the back of a speeding taxi i thought i told you not to come here what said ford a thin ill ­‐looking man wearing something baggy and italian was walking up the stairs past them lighting a cigarette and had stopped suddenly not you he said him he looked straight at arthur then seemed to become a little confused excuse me he said i think i must have mistaken you for someone else he started on up the stairs again but almost immediately turned round once more even more puzzled he stared at arthur now what said ford what did you say i said now what repeated ford irritably yes i think so said the man and swayed slightly and dropped the book of matches hed been carrying his mouth moved weakly then he put his hand to his forehead excuse me he said im trying desperate ly to remember which drug ive just taken but it must be one of those ones which mean you cant remember he shook his head and turned away again and went up towards the mens room come on said ford he hurried on downstairs with arthur following nervously in his wake the encounter had shaken him badly and he didnt know why he didnt like places like this for all of the dreams of earth and home he had had for years he now badly missed his hut on lamuella with his knives and his sandwiches h e even missed old thrashbarg arthur it was the most astounding effect his name was being shouted in stereo he twisted to look one way up the stairs behind him he saw trillian hurrying down towards him in her wonderfully rumpled rymplontm she was looking suddenly aghast he twisted the other way to see what she was looking suddenly aghast at at the bottom of the stairs was trillian wearing no ʹ this was tricia tricia that he had just seen hysterical with confusion on television and behi nd her was random looking more wild ­‐eyed than ever behind her in the recesses of the smart dimly lit club the other clientele of the evening formed a frozen tableau staring anxiously up at the confrontation on the stairs for a few seconds everyone s tood stock still only the music from behind the bar didnt know to stop throbbing the gun she is holding said ford quietly nodding slightly towards random is a wabanatta it was in the ship she stole from me its quite dangerous in fact just d ont move for a moment lets just everybody stay calm and find out whats upsetting her where do i fit screamed random suddenly the hand holding the gun was trembling fiercely her other hand delved into her pocket and pulled out the remains of art hurs watch she shook it at them i thought i would fit here she cried on the world that made me but it turns out that even my mother doesnt know who i am she flung the watch violently aside and it smashed into the glasses behind the bar scatt ering its innards everyone was very quiet for a moment or two longer random said trillian quietly from up on the stairs shut up shouted random you abandoned me random it is very important that you listen to me and understand persisted trillian quietly there isnt very much time we must leave we must all leave what are you talking about were always leaving she had both hands on the gun now and both were shaking there was no one in particular she was pointing it at she was just pointing it at the world in general listen said trillian again i left you because i went to cover a war for the network it was extremely dangerous at least i thought it was going to be i arrived and the war had suddenly ceased to happen there was a time anomaly and listen please listen a reconnaissance battleship had failed to turn up the rest of the fleet was scattered in some farcical disarray its happening all the time now i dont care i dont want to hear about your bloody job shouted random i want a home i want to fit somewhere this is not your home said trillian still keeping her voice calm you dont have one we none of us have one hardly anybody has one any more the missing ship i was just talking about the people of that ship dont have a home they dont know where they are from they dont even have any memory of who they are or what they are for they are very lost and very confused and very frightened they are here in this solar system and they are about to do something very misguided because they are so lost and confused we must leave now i cant tell you where there is to go to perhaps there isnt anywhere but here is not the place to be please one more time can we go random was wavering in panic and confusion its all right said arthur gently if im here were safe dont ask me to explain just now but i am safe so you are safe ok what are you saying said trillian lets all just relax said arthur he was feeling very tranquil his life was charmed and none of this seemed real slowly gradually random began to relax and to let the gun down inch by inch two things happened simultaneously the door to the mens room at the top of the stairs opened and the man who had accosted arthur came out sniffing startled at the sudden movement random lifted the gun again just as a man standing behind her made a grab for it arthur threw himself fo rward there was a deafening explosion he fell awkwardly as trillian threw herself down over him the noise died away arthur looked up to see the man at the top of the stairs gazing down at him with a look of utter stupefaction you he said then s lowly horribly he fell apart random threw the gun down and fell to her knees sobbing im sorry she said im so sorry im so so
