loomings call me ishmael some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on shore i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world it is a way i have of driving oﬀ the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i ﬁnd myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i ﬁnd myself involuntarily pausing before coﬃn warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking people’s hats oﬀ—then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can is is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical ﬂourish cato throws himself upon his sword i quietly take to the ship ere is nothing surprising in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me ere now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharves as indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look at the crowds of watergazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you see—posted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thou sands of mortal men ﬁxed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pierheads some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are the green ﬁelds gone what do they here but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suﬃce no ey must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they stand—miles of them—leagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenues—north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attra them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream ere is magic in it let the most absent minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs set his feet agoing and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs ere stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a cruciﬁx were within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into dis tant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hillside blue but though the piure lies thus tranced and though this pinetree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head yet all were vain unless the shepherd’s eye were ﬁxed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep among tiger lilies—what is the one charm wanting—water—there is not a drop of water there were niagara but a catara of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your ﬁrst voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when ﬁrst told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengers get seasick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves much as a general thing—no i never go as a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinion of such oﬃces to those who like them for my part i abominate all honorable respeable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not and as for going as cook—though i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of oﬃcer on shipboard—yet somehow i never fancied broiling fowls —though once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respefully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at ﬁrst this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touches one’s sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand in awe of you e transition is a keen one i assure you from the schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoion of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears oﬀ in time what of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and respefully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who aint a slave tell me that well then however the old seacaptains may order me about—however they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaion of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should rub each other’s shoulderblades and be content again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must pay and there is all the diﬀerence in the world between paying and being paid e a of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable inﬂiion that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but being paid—what will compare with it e urbane aivity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for as in this world head winds are far more preval ent than winds from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it ﬁrst but not so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things at the same time that the leaders little suspe it but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police oﬃcer of the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and inﬂuences me in some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this grand contested eleion for the presidency of the united states whaling voyage by one ishmael b   a ough i cannot tell why it was exaly that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magniﬁcent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farces—though i cannot tell why this was exaly yet now that i recall all the circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale him self such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity en the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with it—would they let me—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great ﬂoodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there ﬂoated into my inmost soul endless proces sions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air chapter ii the carpetbag i stuﬀed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the paciﬁc quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was on a saturday night in december much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would oﬀer till the following monday as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a ﬁne boisterous something about everything conneed with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket was her great original—the tyre of this carthage—the place where the ﬁrst dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the redmen ﬁrst sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that ﬁrst adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestones—so goes the story —to throw at the whales in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a very dubious looking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silver—so wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and don’t be too particular with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of “e crossed har poons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red windows of the “swordfish inn” there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavement—rather weary for me when i struck my foot against the ﬂinty projeions because from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on ishmael said i at last don’t you hear get away from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instin followed the streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the ﬁrst thing i did was to stumble over an ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha as the ﬂying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but “e crossed harpoons” and “e swordfish”—this then must needs be the sign of “e trap” however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of “e trap” moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneath—“e spouter inn—peter coﬃn” coﬃn—spouter—rather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt distri and as the swinging sign had a povertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coﬀee it was a queer sort of place—a gableended old house one side palsied as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tem pestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul’s tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed “in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon” says an old writer—of whose works i possess the only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous diﬀerence whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier” true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my mind—old blackletter thou reasonest well yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didn’t stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there but it’s too late to make any improvements now e universe is ﬁn ished the copestone is on and the chips were carted oﬀ a million years ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shak ing oﬀ his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken wrapper—he had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a ﬁne frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the ﬁery pit itself in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans but no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and there is plenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort of a place this “spouter” may be chapter iii the spouterinn entering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a wide low strag gling entry with old fashioned wainscots reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at ﬁrst you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the piure over three blue dim perpendicular lines ﬂoating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy piure truly enough to drive a nervous man distraed yet was there a sort of indeﬁnite halfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to ﬁnd out what that mar vellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you through—it’s the black sea in a midnight gale—it’s the unnatural com bat of the four primal elements—it’s a blasted heath—it’s a hyperborean winter scene—it’s the breaking up of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the piure’s midst at once found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic ﬁsh even the great leviathan himself in fa the artist’s design seemed this a ﬁnal theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subje e piure represents a capehorner in a great hurricane the half foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous a of impaling himself upon the three mastheads e opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with glittering teeth resem bling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of human hair and one was sickle shaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new mown grass by a longarmed mower you shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long lance now wildly elbowed ﬁfty years ago did nathan swain kill ﬁfteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoon—so like a cork screw now—was ﬂung in javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterward slain oﬀ the cape of blanco e original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched way—cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with ﬁreplaces all round—you enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corner anchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelflike table covered with cracked glass cases ﬁlled with dusty rarit ies gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks projeing from the further angle of the room stands a darklooking den—the bar—a rude attempt at a right whale’s head be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles ﬂasks and in those jaws of swift destruc tion like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison ough true cyl inders without—within the villainous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads’ goblets fill to this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full glass—the cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was full—not a bed unoccupied “but avast” he added tapping his forehead “you haint no objeions to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket have ye i s’pose you are goin’ a whalin’ so you’d better get used to that sort of thing” i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objeion able why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent man’s blanket “i thought so all right take a seat supper—you want supper supper ’ll be ready direly” i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jackknife stoop ing over and diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didn’t make much headway i thought at last some four or ﬁve of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it was cold as iceland—no ﬁre at all—the landlord said he couldn’t aﬀord it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen ﬁngers but the fare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner “my boy” said the landlord “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty” “landlord” i whispered “that aint the harpooneer is it” “oh no” said he looking a sort of diabolically funny “the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he don’t—he eats nothing but steaks and likes ’em rare” “e devil he does” says i “where is that harpooneer is he here” “he’ll be here afore long” was the answer i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this “dark complexioned” harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried “at’s the grampus’s crew i seed her reported in the oﬃng this morning a three years’ voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now we’ll have the latest news from the feegees” a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was ﬂung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muﬄed in woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiﬀ with icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador ey had just landed from their boat and this was the ﬁrst house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the wrinkled little old jonah there oﬃciating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught oﬀ the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an ice island e liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering about most ob streperously i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest is man interested me at once and since the seagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a coﬀerdam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes ﬂoated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and from his ﬁne stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleganian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favorite with them they raised a cry of “bulkington bulkington where’s bulkington” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it was now about nine o’clock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fa you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i don’t know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objeions indeﬁnitely multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin e more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the ﬁnest i began to twitch all over besides it was getting late and my decent har pooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how could i tell from what vile hole he had been com ing “landlord i’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer—i shan’t sleep with him i’ll try the bench here” “just as you please i’m sorry i can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and notches “but wait a bit skrimshander i’ve got a carpenter’s plane there in the bar—wait i say and i’ll make ye snug enough” so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief ﬁrst dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape e shavings ﬂew right and left till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestruible knot e landlord was near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven’s sake to quit —the bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one—so there was no yoking them i then placed the ﬁrst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night e devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldn’t i steal a march on him—bolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking around me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a suﬀerable night unless in some other person’s bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer inks i i’ll wait awhile he must be dropping in before long i’ll have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer “landlord” said i “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such late hours” it was now hard upon twelve o’clock e landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension “no” he answered “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes he’s the bird what catches the worm—but tonight he went out a peddling you see and i don’t see what on airth keeps him so late unless may be he can’t sell his head” “can’t sell his head—what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me” getting into a towering rage “do you pretend to say landlord that this har pooneer is aually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town” “at’s precisely it” said the landlord “and i told him he couldn’t sell it here the market’s overstocked” “with what” shouted i “with heads to be sure ain’t there too many heads in the world” “i tell you what it is landlord” said i quite calmly “you’d better stop spinning that yarn to me—i’m not green” “may be not” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick “but i rayther guess you’ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin’ his head” “i’ll break it for him” said i now ﬂying into a passion again at this unaccount able farrago of the landlord’s “it’s broke a’ready” said he “broke” said i—“broke do you mean” “sartain and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it i guess” “landlord” said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a snow storm—“landlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpoon eer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and conﬁdential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respes safe to spend the night with him and in the ﬁrst place you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and i’ve no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution” “wall” said the landlord fetching a long breath “that’s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin’ you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of ’balmed new zealand heads great curios you know and he’s sold all on ’em but one and that one he’s trying to sell tonight cause tomorrow’s sunday and it would not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is goin’ to churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inions” is account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me—but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators “depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man” “he pays reg’lar” was the rejoinder “but come it’s getting dreadful late you had better be turning ﬂukes —it’s a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced ere’s plenty room for two to kick about in that bed it’s an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the ﬂoor and came near breaking his arm after that sal said it wouldn’t do come along here i’ll give ye a glim in a jiﬀy” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me oﬀering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed “i vum it’s sunday—you won’t see that harpooneer tonight he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then do come won’t ye come” i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast “ere” said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a washstand and centre table “there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye” i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed ough none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered ﬁreboard representing a man striking a whale of things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the ﬂoor in one corner also a large seaman’s bag containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone ﬁsh hooks on the shelf over the ﬁre place and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfaory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat orna mented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin ere was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head peddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bedside i got up and took oﬀ my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took oﬀ my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven whether that mattress was stuﬀed with corncobs or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid oﬀ into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good oﬃng towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal headpeddler but i lay perfely still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way oﬀ from me on the ﬂoor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth is accomplished however he turned round—when good heavens what a sight such a face it was of a dark purplish yellow color here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares yes it’s just as i thought he’s a terrible bedfellow he’s been in a ﬁght got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be stickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were stains of some sort or other at ﬁrst i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all it’s only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary eﬀes upon the skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some diﬃculty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag he now took oﬀ his hat—a new beaver hat—when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise ere was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but it was the second ﬂoor back i am no coward but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fa i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfaory answer concern ing what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a irty years’ war and just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own brothers he might take a fancy to mine—heavens look at that tomahawk but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about some thing that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back and exaly the color of a three days’ old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at ﬁrst i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some sim ilar manner but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the empty ﬁreplace and removing the papered ﬁreboard sets up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andirons the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this ﬁreplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the ﬂame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into a sacriﬁcial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the ﬁre and still hastier withdrawals of his ﬁngers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing oﬀ the heat and ashes a little he made a polite oﬀer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the ﬁre he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jump ing into bed with me i thought it was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell into which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puﬀed out great clouds of tobacco smoke e next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural responses satisﬁed me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning “whoe debel you”—he at last said—“you no speake damme i kille” and so saying the lighted tomahawk began ﬂourishing about me in the dark “landlord for god’s sake peter coﬃn” shouted i “landlord watch coﬃn angels save me” “speake tellee me whoee be or dam me i kille” again growled the canni bal while his horrid ﬂourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on ﬁre but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him “don’t be afraid now” said he grinning again “queequeg here wouldn’t harm a hair of your head” “stop your grinning” shouted i “and why didn’t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal” “i thought ye know’d it—didn’t i tell ye he was peddlin’ heads around town—but turn ﬂukes again and go to sleep queequeg look here—you sabbee me i sabbee you—this man sleepe you—you sabbee”— “me sabbee plenty”—grunted queequeg puﬃng away at his pipe and sitting up in bed “you gettee in” he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal what’s all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myself—the man’s a human being just as i am he has just as much reason to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian “landlord” said i “tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me it’s dangerous besides i aint insured” is being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely mo tioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to say—i wont touch a leg of ye “good night landlord” said i “you may go” i turned in and never slept better in my life chapter iv the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequeg’s arm thrown over me in the most loving and aﬀeionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife e counterpane was of patchwork full of odd little particolored squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a ﬁgure no two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i ﬁrst awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me my sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle e circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or other—i think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless—my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me oﬀ to bed though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the third ﬂoor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurreion sixteen hours in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worse and worse—at last i got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favor to give me a good slippering for my mis behavior anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for several hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—i opened my eyes and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand be longed sseated by my bedside for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever think ing that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experi enced on waking up and seeing queequeg’s pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past night’s events soberly recurred one by one in ﬁxed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his arm—unlock his bridegroom clasp—yet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse him—“queequeg”—but his only answer was a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a slight scratch rowing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage’s side as if it were a hatchetfaced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk “queequeg—in the name of goodness queequeg wake” at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extraing a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiﬀ as a pikestaﬀ looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawn ing over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the charaer of his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fa he jumped out upon the ﬂoor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress ﬁrst and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself inks i queequeg under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular compliment to queequeg be cause he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you don’t see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his boots what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand and hat on—under the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition state —neither caterpillar nor butterﬂy he was just enough civilized to show oﬀ his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner his education was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him at the ﬁrst go oﬀ of a bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous ﬁgure that queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restriing his ablutions to his chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the washstand centretable dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he taes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks inks i queequeg this is using rogers’s best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what ﬁne steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept e rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshal’s baton chapter v the street if i had been astonished at ﬁrst catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that aston ishment soon departed upon taking my ﬁrst daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently oﬀer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the aﬀrighted ladies regent street is

dandy will compare with a countrybred one—i mean a down right bumpkin dandy—a fellow that in the dogdays will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a country

stands a whaleman’s chapel and few are the moody ﬁshermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or paciﬁc who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not returning from my ﬁrst morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special errand e sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors’ wives and widows a muﬄed silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm each

of him by all the congregation suﬃciently attested that this ﬁne old man was the chaplain yes it was the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favorite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second ﬂowering youth for among all the ﬁssures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february’s snow no one having previously heard his history could for the ﬁrst time behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the ﬂoor with the weight of the water it had absorbed however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a regular

pulpit without a stairs substituting a per pendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea e wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted manropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany color the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the manropes father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailorlike but still rever ential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the maintop of his vessel e perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every step there was a joint at my ﬁrst glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanity that i could not suspe him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbol ize something unseen can it be then that by that a of physical isolation he signiﬁes his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a self containing stronghold—a lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplain’s former seafarings between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large paint ing representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm oﬀ a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers but high above the ﬂying scud and darkrolling clouds there ﬂoated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angel’s face and this bright face shed a distin spot of radiance upon the ship’s tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the viory’s plank where nelson fell ”ah noble ship“ the angel seemed to say ”beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling oﬀ—serenest azure is at hand“ nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste that had achieved the ladder and the piure its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship’s bluﬀ bows and the holy bible rested on the projeing piece of scroll work fashioned after a ship’s ﬁddleheaded beak what could be more full of meaning—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s fore most part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the world from thence it is the storm of god’s quick wrath is ﬁrst descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is ﬁrst invoked for favorable winds yes the world’s a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its prow chapter viii the sermon father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense “starboard gangway there side away to larboard—larboard gangway to starboard midships midships” ere was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and a still slighter shuﬄing of women’s shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows folded his large brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and oﬀered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea is ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy— “e ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all god’s sunlit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can tell— oh i was plunging to despair in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaints— no more the whale did me conﬁne with speed he ﬂew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright as lightning shone e face of my deliverer god my song for ever shall record at terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power” nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said “be loved shipmates clinch the last verse of the ﬁrst chapter of jonah—“and god had prepared a great ﬁsh to swallow up jonah” “shipmates this book containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what depths of the soul does jonah’s deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the ﬁsh’s belly how billow like and boisterously grand we feel the ﬂoods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a two stranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and ﬁnally the deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of god—never mind now what that command was or how conveyed—which he found a hard command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further ﬂouts at god by seeking to ﬂee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship that’s bound for tarshish ere lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz at’s the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaﬀa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought to ﬂee worldwide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered selfcondemning is his look that had there been policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly he’s a fugitive no baggage not a hatbox valise or carpetbag—no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux at last after much dodging search he ﬁnds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the stranger’s evil eye jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and conﬁdence in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious way one whispers to the other—“jack he’s robbed a widow” or “joe do you mark him he’s a bigamist” or “harry lad i guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderers from sodom” another runs to read the bill that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored oﬀering ﬁve hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he reads and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward he will not confess himself suspeed but that itself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors ﬁnd him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends into the cabin “who’s there” cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the customs—“who’s there” oh how that harmless question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to ﬂee again but he rallies “i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir” us far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance “we sail with the next coming tide” at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him “no sooner sir”—“soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger” ha jonah that’s another stab but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent “i’ll sail with ye”—he says—“the passage money how much is that—i’ll pay now“ for it is particularly written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history“that he paid the fare thereof” ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of meaning now jonah’s captain shipmates was one whose discernment detes crime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers so jonah’s captain prepares to test the length of jonah’s purse ere he judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and it’s assented to en the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a ﬂight that paves its rear with gold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the captain he rings every coin to ﬁnd a counterfeit not a forger any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage “point out my stateroom sir” says jonah now “i’m travelweary i need sleep” “ou look’st like it” says the captain “there’s thy room” jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convis’ cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and ﬁnds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead e air is close and jonah gasps then in that contraed hole sunk too beneath the ship’s waterline jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stiﬂing hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowel’s wards screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonah’s room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp ﬂame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung e lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive ﬁnds no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiion in the lamp more and more appals him e ﬂoor the ceiling and the side are all awry “oh so my conscience hangs in me” he groans “straight upward so it burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness” like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the roman race horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the ﬁt be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and there’s naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth jonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep and now the time of tide has come the ship casts oﬀ her cables and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea at ship my friends was the ﬁrst of recorded smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonah’s head in all this raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship—a berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear “what meanest thou o sleeper arise” startled from his lethargy by that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and ﬁnding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet aﬂoat and ever as the white moon shows her aﬀrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing atti tudes the godfugitive is now too plainly known e sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by re ferring the whole matter to high heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them e lot is jonah’s that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their questions “what is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people” but mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah e eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions but likewise an other answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him “i am a hebrew” he cries—and then —“i fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land” fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on to make a full con fession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts—when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not unreluantly lay hold of jonah “and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness ﬂoats out from the east and the sea is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory teeth like the lord out of the ﬁsh’s belly but observe his prayer and so many white bolts upon his prison en jonah prayed unto learn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for dire deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god was this condu in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah” while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonah’s seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from oﬀ his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them ere now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly with an aspe of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these words “shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god how being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise ﬂed from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along “into the midst of the seas“ where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and” the weeds were wrapped about his head“ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet—“out of the belly of hell”—when the whale grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried en god spake unto the ﬁsh and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and earth and “vomited out jonah upon the dry land” when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beaten—his ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean—jonah did the almighty’s bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the truth to the face of falsehood at was it “is shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world courts not dishonor woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway” he drooped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm—“but oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the maintruck higher than the kelson is low delight is to him—a far far upward and inward delight —who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges delight—topgallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his ﬁnal breath—o father—chieﬂy known to me by y rod—mortal or immortal here i die i have striven to be ine more than to be this world’s or mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to ee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god” he said no more but slowly waving a benediion covered his face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place chapter ix a bosom friend returning to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediion some time he was sitting on a bench before the ﬁre with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every ﬁftieth page—as i fancied—stopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he would then begin again at the next ﬁfty seeming to commence at number one each time as though he could not count more than ﬁfty and it was only by such a large number of ﬁfties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and hideously marred about the face—at least to my taste —his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you cannot hide the soul rough all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes ﬁery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bear ing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washington’s head as seen in the popular busts of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise very projeing like two long promon tories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed whilst i was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be look ing out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the aﬀec tionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indiﬀerence of his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do not know exaly how to take them at ﬁrst they are overawing their calm selfcolleedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way of cape horn that is—which was the only way he could get there —thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself surely this was a touch of ﬁne philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have ”broken his digester” as i sat there in that now lonely room the ﬁre burning low in that mild stage when after its ﬁrst intensity has warmed the air it then only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolﬁsh world is soothing savage had redeemed it ere he sat his very indiﬀerence speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me i’ll try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him mean while at ﬁrst he little noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last night’s hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few piures that were in it us i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly oﬀered me a puﬀ and then we sat exchanging puﬀs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between us if there yet lurked any ice of indiﬀerence towards me in the pagan’s breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his country’s phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be in a coun tryman this sudden ﬂame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room to gether he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pock ets i let them stay he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper ﬁreboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presby terian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do you suppose now ish mael that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth—pagans and all included —can possibly be jealous of an insigniﬁcant bit of black wood impossible but what is worship—to do the will of god— that is worship and what is the will of god—to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me— that is the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol oﬀered him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for conﬁdential disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning us then in our hearts’ honeymoon lay i and queequeg—a cosy loving pair chapter x nightgown we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and queequeg now and then aﬀeionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the future yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our two noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans we felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no ﬁre in the room e more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you ﬂatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a ﬁre which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air en there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an aric crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and selfcreated darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelveo’clockatnight i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did i at all obje to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puﬀs from his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiﬀ prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of insurance i was only alive to the condensed conﬁdential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the ﬂame of the newlit lamp whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly complied ough at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter xi biographical queequeg was a native of kokovoko an island far away to the west and south it is not down in any map true places never are when a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in queequeg’s ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors ere was excellent blood in his veins—royal stuﬀ though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his father’s bay and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his father’s inﬂuence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled oﬀ to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water hiding his canoe still aﬂoat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a ﬂash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ringbolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but this ﬁne young savage—this sea prince of wales never saw the captain’s cabin ey put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen for at bottom—so he told me—he was auated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were but alas the praices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked inﬁnitely more so than all his father’s heathens arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also poor queequeg gave it up for lost ought he it’s a wicked world in all meridians i’ll die a pagan and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unﬁtted him for ascending the pure and undeﬁled throne of thirty pagan kings before him but by and by he said he would return—as soon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans ey had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future move ments he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the aﬀeion i now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant seamen his story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puﬀ queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping chapter xii wheelbarrow next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own and comrade’s bill using however my comrade’s money e grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequeg— especially as peter coﬃn’s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poor carpetbag and queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock away we went down to “the moss” the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so much —for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets—but at seeing him and me upon such conﬁdential terms but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not ﬁnd their own harpoons to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet he had a particular aﬀeion for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuﬀ well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own scythes —though in no wise obliged to furnished them—even so queequeg for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the ﬁrst wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor e owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the thing—though in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow —queequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf “why” said i “queequeg you might have known better than that one would think didn’t the people laugh” upon this he told me another story e people of his island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a cer tain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and its commander—from all accounts a very stately punilious gentleman at least for a sea captain —this commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg’s sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king queequeg’s father grace being said—for those people have their grace as well as we —though queequeg told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts—grace i say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating ﬁngers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himself—being captain of a ship—as having plain pre cedence over a mere island king especially in the king’s own house—the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punch bowl—taking it i suppose for a huge ﬁngerglass “now“ said queequeg “what you tink now—didn’t our people laugh” at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoist ing sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their ice covered trees all glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the worldwandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of ﬁres and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly eﬀort gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings how i snuﬀed that tartar air—how i spurned that turnpike earth—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records at the same foamfountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his ﬁled and pointed teeth on on we ﬂew and our oﬃng gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her brows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bow sprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a lubberlike assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so compan ionable as though a white man were anything more digniﬁed than a whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkin’s hour of doom was come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in midsomerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puﬀ “capting capting“ yelled the bumpkin running towards that oﬃcer “cap ting capting here’s the devil” “hallo you sir“ cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg “what in thunder do you mean by that don’t you know you might have killed that chap” “what him say“ said queequeg as he mildly turned to me “he say” said i “that you came near kille that man there“ pointing to the still shivering greenhorn “kille” cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expres sion of disdain “ah him bevy smalle ﬁshe queequeg no kille so smalle ﬁshe queequeg kille big whale“ “look you” roared the captain “i’ll kille you you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye“ but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye e prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the weather sheet and the tremendous boom was now ﬂying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck e poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it ﬂew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then ﬂinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe e schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved e greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now took an instant’s glance around him and seeming to see just how matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form e boat soon picked them up e poor bumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he only asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine oﬀ that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to himself—“it’s a mutual jointstock world in all meridians we cannibals must help these christians” chapter xiii nantucket nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a ﬁne run we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stands there away oﬀ shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse look at it—a mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background ere is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they don’t grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a day’s walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoes something like laplander snowshoes that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the redmen us goes the legend in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast and carried oﬀ an infant indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters ey resolved to follow in the same direion setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casket—the poor little indian’s skeleton what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood ey ﬁrst caught crabs and quohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed oﬀ in boats and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at behring’s straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the ﬂood most monstrous and most mountainous at himmalehan saltsea mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexan ders parcelling out among them the atlantic paciﬁc and indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing ban ner from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer’s for the sea is his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but ﬂoating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself e nantuck eter he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation ere is his home there lies his business which a noah’s ﬂood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between bil lows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales chapter xiv chowder it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed e landlord of the spouterinn had recommen ded us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at the try pots but the direions he had given us about keeping a yellow ware house on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the ﬁrst man we met where the place was these crooked direions of his very much puzzled us at ﬁrst especially as at the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our ﬁrst point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coﬃn to say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses’ ears swung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of an old doorway e horns of the crosstrees were sawed oﬀ on the other side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two of them one for queequeg and one for me it’s ominous thinks i a coﬃn my innkeeper upon landing in my ﬁrst whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet i was called from these reﬂeions by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt “get along with ye” said she to the man “or i’ll be combing ye” “come on queequeg” said i “all right ere’s mrs hussey” and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his aﬀairs upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast turned round to us and said—“clam or cod” “what’s that about cods ma’am” said i with much politeness “clam or cod” she repeated “a clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mrs hussey” says i “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time ain’t it mrs hussey” but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam” mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out “clam for two” disappeared “queequeg” said i “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam” however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospe before us but when that smoking chowder came in the mys tery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship bis cuit and salted pork cut up into little ﬂakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favorite ﬁshing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs hussey’s clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the savory steam came forth again but with a diﬀerent ﬂavor and in good time a ﬁne cod chowder was placed before us we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i to myself i wonder now if this here has any eﬀe on the head what’s that stultifying saying about chowderheaded people “but look queequeg ain’t that a live eel in your bowl where’s your harpoon” fishiest of all ﬁshy places was the try pots which well deserved its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for ﬁshbones coming through your clothes e area before the house was paved with clamshells mrs hussey wore a polished necklace of codﬁsh vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old sharkskin ere was a ﬁshy ﬂavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some ﬁshermen’s boats i saw hosea’s brindled cow feeding on ﬁsh remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head looking very slipshod i assure ye supper concluded we received a lamp and direions from mrs hussey con cerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers “why not” said i “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not” “because it’s dangerous” says she “ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort’nt v’y’ge of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three barrels of ile was found dead in my ﬁrst ﬂoor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich danger ous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg”for she had learned his name “i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod tomorrow for breakfast men” “both” says i “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety” chapter xv the ship in bed we concoed our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently con sulting yojo—the name of his black little god—and yojo had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together among the whalingﬂeet in harbor and in concert seleing our craft in stead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the seleion of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespeive of queequeg i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great con ﬁdence in the excellence of yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who per haps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs now this plan of queequeg’s or rather yojo’s touching the seleion of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied on queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best ﬁtted to carry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced no eﬀe upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that triﬂing little aﬀair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day how it was i never could ﬁnd out for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articles—leaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacriﬁcial ﬁre of shavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries i learnt that there were three ships up for threeyears’ voyages—e devildam the tit bit and the pequod devil dam i do not know the origin of titbit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extin as the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devildam from her hopped over to the titbit and ﬁnally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i know—squared toed luggers mountainous japanese junks butterbox galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an old fashioned clawfooted look about her long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a french grenadier’s who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her ven erable bows looked bearded her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiﬄy up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrimworshipped ﬂagstone in canterbury cathedral where beckett bled but to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed old captain peleg many years her chiefmate before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owners of the pequod—this old peleg during the term of his chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be orkillhake’s carved buckler or bedstead she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian em peror his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to ose thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of seaivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe e helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds back his ﬁery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble things are touched with that now when i looked about the quarterdeck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at ﬁrst i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast it seemed only a temporary ereion used in port it was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the rightwhale planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy ﬁbres waved to and fro like a topknot on some old pottowotamie sachem’s head a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by his aspe seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ship’s work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command he was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuﬀ of which the wigwam was construed ere was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the quaker style only there was a ﬁne and almost microscopic network of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and al ways looking to windward—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together such eye wrinkles are very eﬀeual in a scowl “is this the captain of the pequod” said i advancing to the door of the tent “supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him” he demanded “i was thinking of shipping” “ou wast wast thou i see thou are no nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat” “no sir i never have” “dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare say—eh” “nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn i’ve been several voyages in the merchant service and i think that—” “marchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that leg—i’ll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships but ﬂukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling eh—it looks a little suspicious don’t it eh—hast not been a pirate hast thou —didst not rob thy last captain didst thou—dost not think of murdering the oﬃcers when thou gettest to sea” i protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask of these half humorous inuendoes this old seaman as an insulated quakerish nantuck eter was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard “but what takes thee awhaling i want to know that before i think of shipping ye” “well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world” “want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab” “who is captain ahab sir” “aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship” “i am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself” “ou art speaking to captain peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod ﬁtted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of ﬁnding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt ﬁnd that he has only one leg” “what do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale” “lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat—ah ah” i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i could “what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fa of the accident” “look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft d’ye see thou dost not talk shark a bit sure ye’ve been to sea before now sure of that” “sir” said i “i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the mer chant—” “hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant service—don’t aggravate me—i won’t have it but let us understand each other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it” “i do sir” “very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale’s throat and then jump after it answer quick” “i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i don’t take to be the fa” “good again now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling to ﬁnd out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there” for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exaly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl captain peleg started me on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the ﬂoodtide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean e prospe was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see “well what’s the report” said peleg when i came back “what did ye see” “not much” i replied—“nothing but water considerable horizon though and there’s a squall coming up i think” “well what dost thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh can’t ye see the world where you stand” i was a little staggered but go awhaling i must and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as any —i thought the best—and all this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me “and thou mayest as well sign the papers right oﬀ” he added—“ come along with ye” and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surpris ing ﬁgure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a quaker the island having been originally settled by that se and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modiﬁed by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale hunters ey are ﬁghting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of charaer not unworthy a scandinavian seaking or a poetical pagan roman and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long nightwatches in the remotest waters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving all nature’s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and con ﬁding breast and thereby chieﬂy but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole na tion’s census—a mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedies nor will it at all detra from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circum stances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of the quaker modiﬁed by individual circumstances like captain peleg captain bildad was a welltodo retired whaleman but unlike captain peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the veriest of all triﬂes—captain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the striest se of nan tucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the horn—all that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad ough refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and paciﬁc and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight bodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contem plative evening of his days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminis cence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing and this praical world quite another is world pays dividends rising from a little cabinboy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpoon eer in a broad shadbellied waistcoat from that becoming boatheader chiefmate and captain and ﬁnally a shipowner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from aive life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his wellearned income now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hard taskmaster ey told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he was certainly rather hardhearted to say the least he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a chiefmate to have his drabcolored eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marlingspike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished from before him his own person was the exa embodiment of his utilitarian charaer on his long gaunt body he carried no spare ﬂesh no superﬂuous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat such then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin e space between the decks was small and there bolt upright sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broadbrim was placed beside him his legs were stiﬄy crossed his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and speacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume “bildad” cried captain peleg“ at it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad” as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg “he says he’s our man bildad” said peleg“ he wants to ship” “dost thee” said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me “i dost” said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker “what do ye think of him bildad” said peleg “he’ll do” said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ship’s articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the proﬁts called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respeive duties of the ship’s company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be oﬀered at least the th lay—that is the th part of the clear nett proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to and though the th lay was what they call a rather long lay yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three years’ beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely for tune—and so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the under cloud upon the whole i thought that the th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been oﬀered the th considering i was of a broadshouldered make but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the proﬁts was this ashore i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the whole management of the ship’s aﬀairs to these two and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his own ﬁreside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jackknife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book“ lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth—” “well captain bildad” interrupted peleg“ what d’ye say what lay shall we give this young man” “ou knowest best” was the sepulchral reply “the seven hundred and seventy seventh wouldn’t be too much would it —”where moth and rust do corrupt but lay— lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventyseventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt it was an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the magnitude of the ﬁgure it might at ﬁrst deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventyseven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a teenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventyseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventyseven gold doubloons and so i thought at the time “why blast your eyes bildad” cried peleg “ou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that” “seven hundred and seventyseventh” again said bildad without lifting his eyes and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is there will your heart be also” “i am going to put him down for the three hundredth” said peleg “do ye hear that bildad e three hundredth lay i say” bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said “captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans e seven hundred and seventyseventh lay captain peleg” “ou bildad” roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin “blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn” “captain peleg” said bildad steadily “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i can’t tell but as thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the ﬁery pit captain peleg” “fiery pit ﬁery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me it’s an allﬁred outrage to tell any human creature that he’s bound to hell flukes and ﬂames bildad say that again to me and start my soulbolts but i’ll—i’ll—yes i’ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting drabcolored son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye” as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as for peleg after letting oﬀ his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated “whew” he whistled at last—“the squall’s gone oﬀ to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jackknife here needs the grindstone at’s he thank ye bildad now then my young man ishmael’s thy name didn’t ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay” “captain peleg” said i “i have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall i bring him down tomorrow” “to be sure” said peleg “fetch him along and we’ll look at him” “what lay does he want” groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself “oh never thee mind about that bildad” said peleg “has he ever whaled it any” turning to me “killed more whales than i can count” captain peleg “well bring him along then” and after signing the papers oﬀ i went nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning’s work and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a whaleship will be completely ﬁtted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea however it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be found “and what dost thou want of captain ahab it’s all right enough thou art shipped” “yes but i should like to see him” “but i don’t think thou wilt be able to at present i don’t know exaly what’s the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he don’t look so in fa he ain’t sick but no he isn’t well either any how young man he won’t always see me so i don’t suppose he will thee he’s a queer man captain ahab—so some think —but a good one oh thou’lt like him well enough no fear no fear he’s a grand ungodly godlike man captain ahab doesn’t speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned ahab’s above the common ahab’s been in colleges as well as ’mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves ﬁxed his ﬁery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he ain’t captain bildad no and he ain’t captain peleg he’s ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king” “and a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood” “come hither to me—hither hither” said peleg with a signi ﬁcance in his eye that almost startled me “look ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself ’twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee it’s a lie i know captain ahab well i’ve sailed with him as mate years ago i know what he is—a good man—not a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a good deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale he’s been a kind of moody —desperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass oﬀ and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so goodbye to thee—and wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet resigned girl ink of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities” as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab ﬁlled me with a certain wild vagueness of pain fulness concerning him and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i don’t know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not exaly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it did not dis incline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfely as he was known to me then however my thoughts were at length carried in other direions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind chapter xvi his mark as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carry ing his harpoon captain peleg in his gruﬀ voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspeed my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announ cing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers “what do you mean by that captain peleg” said i now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf “i mean” he replied “he must show his papers” “yea” said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind peleg’s out of the wigwam ”he must show that he’s converted son of darkness“ he added turning to queequeg “art thou at present in communion with any christian church” “why” said i “he’s a member of the first congregational church” here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches “first congregational church” cried bildad “what that worships in deacon deuteronomy coleman’s meetinghouse” and so saying taking out his speacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiﬄy over the bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg “how long hath he been a member” he then said turning to me “not very long i rather guess young man” “no” said peleg “and he hasn’t been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devil’s blue oﬀ his face” “do tell now” cried bildad “is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomy’s meeting i never saw him going there and i pass it every lord’s day” “i don’t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeeting” said i “all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is” “young man” said bildad sternly “thou art skylarking with me—explain thy self thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me” finding myself thus hard pushed i replied “i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us and every mother’s son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer crotchets noways touching the grand belief in that we all join hands” “splice thou mean’st splice hands” cried peleg drawing nearer “young man you’d better ship for a missionary instead of a foremast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomy—why father mapple himself couldn’t beat it and he’s reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog there—what’s that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon he’s got there looks like good stuﬀ that and he handles it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whaleboat did you ever strike a ﬁsh” without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this— “cap’ain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den” and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildad’s broad brim clean across the ship’s decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight “now” said queequeg quietly hauling in the line “sposee him whalee eye why dad whale dead” “quick bildad” said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the ﬂying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway “quick i say you bildad and get the ship’s papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay and that’s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket” so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship’s company to which i myself belonged when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for sign ing he turned to me and said “i guess quohog there don’t know how to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark” but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the oﬀered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exa counterpart of a queer round ﬁg ure which was tattooed upon his arm so that through captain peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this— meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tras and seleing one entitled “e latter day com ing or no time to lose” placed it in queequeg’s hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said “son of dark ness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the ﬁery pit” something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad’s language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases “avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer” cried peleg “pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish ere was young nat swaine once the bravest boatheader out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of afterclaps in case he got stove and went to davy jones” “peleg peleg” said bildad lifting his eyes and hands “thou thyself as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then can’st thou prate in this ungodly guise ou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab did’st thou not think of death and the judgment then” “hear him hear him now” cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrust ing his hands far down into his pockets— “hear him all of ye ink of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft ink of death and the judg ment then no no time to think about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all hands—how to rig jurymasts—how to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of” bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him ere he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted chapter xvii the prophet “shipmates have ye shipped in that ship” queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled his massive foreﬁnger at the vessel in question he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a conﬂuent smallpox had in all direions ﬂowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up “have ye shipped in her” he repeated “you mean the ship pequod i suppose” said i trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him “aye the pequod —that ship there” he said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the ﬁxed bayonet of his pointed ﬁnger darted full at the obje “yes” said i “we have just signed the articles” “anything down there about your souls” “about what” “oh perhaps you hav’n’t got any” he said quickly “no matter though i know many chaps that hav’n’t got any—good luck to ’em and they are all the better oﬀ for it a soul’s a sort of a ﬁfth wheel to a wagon” “what are you jabbering about shipmate” said i “he’s got enough though to make up for all deﬁciencies of that sort in other chaps” abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he “queequeg” said i “let’s go this fellow has broken loose from somewhere he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t know” “stop” cried the stranger “ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen old under yet have ye” “who’s old under” said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner “captain ahab” “what the captain of our ship the pequod” “aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name ye hav’n’t seen him yet have ye” “no we hav’n’t he’s sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long” “all right again before long” laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh “look ye when captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before” “what do you know about him” “what did they tell you about him say that” “ey didn’t tell much of anything about him only i’ve heard that he’s a good whalehunter and a good captain to his crew” “at’s true that’s true—yes both true enough but you must jump when he gives an order step and growl growl and go—that’s the word with captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him oﬀ cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santa—heard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy didn’t ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh no i don’t think ye did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess but hows’ever mayhap ye’ve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say oh yes that every one knows a’most—i mean they know he’s only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other oﬀ” “my friend” said i “what all this gibberish of yours is about i don’t know and i don’t much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the loss of his leg” “all about it eh—sure you do —all” “pretty sure” with ﬁnger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggarlike stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and said—“ye’ve shipped have ye names down on the papers well well what’s signed is signed and what’s to be will be and then again perhaps it wont be after all any how it’s all ﬁxed and arranged a’ready and some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any other men god pity ’em morning to ye shipmates morning the ineﬀable heavens bless ye i’m sorry i stopped ye” “look here friend” said i “if you have anything important to tell us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistaken in your game that’s all i have to say” “and it’s said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for him—the likes of ye morning to ye shipmates morning oh when ye get there tell ’em i’ve concluded not to make one of ’em” “ah my dear fellow you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him” “morning to ye shipmates morning” “morning it is” said i “come along queequeg let’s leave this crazy man but stop tell me your name will you” “elijah” elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each other’s fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and looking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine is circumstance coupled with his ambiguous halfhinting halfrevealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and halfapprehensions and all conneed with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn ﬁt and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediion of the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without seeming to notice us is relieved me and once more and ﬁnally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug chapter xviii all astir a day or two passed and there was great aivity aboard the pequod not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything betokened that the ship’s prepar ations were hurrying to a close captain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp lookout upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after nightfall on the day following queequeg’s signing the articles word was given at all the inns where the ship’s company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our traps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod was fully equipped every one knows what a multitude of things—beds saucepans knives and forks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a three years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers costermongers doors bakers and bankers and though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the ﬁshery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruion and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain bildad’s sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if she could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate’s desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of ﬂannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which was charity—aunt charity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of wellsaved dollars but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once and a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the masthead and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the craft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship to these questions they would answer that he was getting better and better and was expeed aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to ﬁt the vessel for the voyage if i had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute diator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea but when a man suspes any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me i said nothing and tried to think nothing at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start chapter xix going aboard it was nearly six o’clock but only grey imperfe misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf “ere are some sailors running ahead there if i see right” said i to queequeg “it can’t be shadows she’s oﬀ by sunrise i guess come on” “avast” cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah “going aboard hands oﬀ will you” said i “lookee here” said queequeg shaking himself“go ’way” “aint going aboard then” “yes we are” said i “but what business is that of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent” “no no no i wasn’t aware of that” said elijah slowly and wonderingly look ing from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable glances “elijah” said i “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we are going to the indian and paciﬁc oceans and would prefer not to be detained” “ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast” “he’s cracked queequeg” said i “come on” “holloa” cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces “never mind him” said i “queequeg come on” but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder said—“did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago” struck by this plain matteroffa question i answered saying “yes i thought i did see four or ﬁve men but it was too dim to be sure” “very dim very dim” said elijah “morning to ye” once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and touch ing my shoulder again said “see if you can ﬁnd ’em now will ye” “find who” “morning to ye morning to ye” he rejoined again moving oﬀ “oh i was going to warn ye against—but never mind never mind—it’s all one all in the family too—sharp frost this morning ain’t it good bye to ye shan’t see ye again very soon i guess unless it’s before the grand jury” and with these cracked words he ﬁnally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving e cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered peajacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms e profoundest slumber slept upon him “ose sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to” said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear as though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there “gracious queequeg don’t sit there” said i “oh perry dood seat” said queequeg “my country way won’t hurt him face” “face” said i “call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes he’s heaving himself get oﬀ queequeg you are heavy it’s grinding the face of the poor get oﬀ queequeg look he’ll twitch you oﬀ soon i wonder he don’t wake” queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respe you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those gardenchairs which are convertible into walkingsticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me he ﬂourished the hatchetside of it over the sleeper’s head “what’s that for queequeg” “perry easy kille oh perry easy” he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipe which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were direly attraed to the sleeping rigger e strong vapor now completely ﬁlling the contraed hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muﬄedness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes “holloa” he breathed at last “who be ye smokers” “shipped men” answered i “when does she sail” “aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails today e captain came aboard last night” “what captain—ahab” “who but him indeed” i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck “holloa starbuck’s astir” said the rigger “he’s a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to” and so saying he went on deck and we followed“ it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were aively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin chapter xx merry christmas at length towards noon upon the ﬁnal dismissal of the ship’s riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the everthoughtful charity had come oﬀ in a whaleboat with her last gift—a nightcap for stubb the second mate her brotherinlaw and a spare bible for the steward— after all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said ”now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is all ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore eh well call all hands then muster ’em aft here—blast ’em” “no need of profane words however great the hurry peleg” said bildad “but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding” how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarterdeck just as if they were to be joint commanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilot’s and as he was not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad “aft here ye sons of bachelors” he cried as the sailors lingered at the main mast “mr starbuck drive ’em aft” “strike the tent there—was the next order as i hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor ”man the capstan blood and thunder—jump“—was the next command and the crew sprang for the handspikes now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other oﬃces was one of the licensed pilots of the port—he being suspeed to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilotfee to all the ships he was concerned in for he never piloted any other craft—bildad i say might now be seen aively engaged in looking over the bows for the approach ing anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless not three days previ ous bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seaman’s berth meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventyseventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horriﬁed at the apparition of captain peleg in the a of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity at was my ﬁrst kick ”is that the way they heave in the marchant service“ he roared ”spring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbone why don’t ye spring i say all of ye—spring quohog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there scotchcap spring thou green pants spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out“ and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading oﬀ with his psalmody inks i captain peleg must have been drinking something to day at last the anchor was up the sails were set and oﬀ we glided it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor e long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from the bows lank bildad as pilot headed the ﬁrst watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard— ”sweet ﬁelds beyond the swelling ﬂood stand dressed in living green so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between“ never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then ey were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer at last we gained such an oﬃng that the two pilots were needed no longer e stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were aﬀeed at this junure especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage—beyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say good bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him—poor old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides” ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only bounded by the faroﬀ unseen eastern continents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say “nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can” as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philo sophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to deck—now a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate but at last he turned to his comrade with a ﬁnal sort of look about him—“captain bildad—come old shipmate we must go back the mainyard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful careful—come bildad boy—say your last luck to ye starbuck—luck to ye mr stubb—luck to ye mr flask—goodbye and good luck to ye all—and this day three years i’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away” “god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men” murmured old bildad almost incoherently “i hope ye’ll have ﬁne weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he needs and ye’ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go be careful in the hunt ye mates don’t stave the boats needlessly ye harpooneers good

emulation of the naval oﬃcers he should append the initials s w f sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of busi ness and that when aively engaged therein we are surrounded by all

at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whaleship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battleﬁelds from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies’ plaudits and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier’s profession let me assure ye that

after embattling his fas an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his cause—such an advocate would he not be blameworthy it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their funions is gone through ere is a saltcellar of state so called and there may be a caster of state how they use the salt precisely—who knows certain i am however that a king’s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hairoil unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere as a general rule he can’t amount to much in his totality but the only thing to be considered here is this—what kind of oil is used at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil nor

earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his ﬂesh being hard as twicebaked biscuit transported to the indies his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried up all his physical superﬂuousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it was merely the condensation of the man he was by no means illlooking quite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent ﬁt and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a reviviﬁed egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousandfold perils he had calmly confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of aion and not a tame chapter of sounds yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times aﬀeed and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his far away domestic memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent inﬂuences which in some honesthearted men restrain the gush of daredevil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the ﬁshery ”i will have no man in my boat” said starbuck “who is not afraid of a whale“ by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward ”aye aye” said stubb the second mate ”starbuck there is as careful a man as you’ll ﬁnd anywhere in this ﬁshery” but we shall ere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally praical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outﬁts of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sundown nor for persisting in ﬁghting a ﬁsh that too much persisted in ﬁghting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own father’s where in the bottomless deeps could he ﬁnd the torn limbs of his brother with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain supersti tiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still ﬂourish must indeed have been extreme but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its conﬁnement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chieﬂy visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding ﬁrm in the conﬂi with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those more terriﬁc because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abase ment of poor starbuck’s fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write

was a native of cape cod and hence according to local usage was called a capecod man a happygolucky neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indiﬀerent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and colleed as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year good humored easy and careless he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat as an old stagedriver is about the snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very deathlock of the ﬁght he handled his unpitying lance coolly and oﬀhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadig tunes while ﬂank and ﬂank with the most exasperated monster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would ﬁnd out when he obeyed the order and not sooner what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easygoing unfearing man so cheerily trudging oﬀ with the burden of life in a world full of grave ped dlers all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious goodhumor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face you would almost as soon have expeed him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in suc cession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of ﬁrst putting his legs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his pe culiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or aﬂoat is terribly infeed with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfeing agent e third mate was flask a native of tisbury in martha’s vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily aﬀronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale was but a species of magniﬁed mouse or at least waterrat requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil is ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales he followed these ﬁsh for the fun of it and a three years’ voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time as a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long ey called him kingpost on board of the pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in aric whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted in it served to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas now these three mates—starbuck stubb and flask were momentous men ey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod’s boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as captains of companies or being armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were ﬂingers of javelins and since in this famous ﬁshery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is always accompanied by his boatsteerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunures provides him with a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover as there generally sub sists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the pequod’s harpooneers were and to what headsman each of them belonged first of all was queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had seleed for his squire but queequeg is already known next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of martha’s vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the ﬁshery they usually go by the generic name of gayheaders tashtego’s long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding eyes—for an indian oriental in their largeness but antaric in their glittering expression—all this suﬃciently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longer snuﬃng in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son ﬁtly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans and half believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air tashtego was stubb the second mate’s squire ird among the harpooneers was daggoo a gigantic coal black negro savage with a lionlike tread—an ahasuerus to behold suspended from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called them ringbolts and would talk of securing the topsail halyards to them in his youth daggoo had voluntar ily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pa gan harbors most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold life of the ﬁshery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and ere as a giraﬀe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet ﬁve in his socks ere was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white ﬂag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a chessman beside him as for the residue of the pequod’s company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale ﬁshery are americans born though pretty nearly all the oﬃcers are herein it is the same with the american whale ﬁshery as with the american army and military and merchant navies and the engineer ing forces employed in the construion of the american canals and railroads e same i say because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peas ants of those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london put in at the shetland islands to receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but islanders seem to make the best whalemen ey were nearly all islanders in the pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each isolato living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back black little pip —he never did—oh no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim pequod’s forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarterdeck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there chapter xxvi ahab for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen of cap tain ahab e mates regularly relieved each other at the watches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and diator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not per mitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my ﬁrst vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation is was strangely heightened at times by the ragged elijah’s diabolical incoher ences uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness—to call it so—which i felt yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchantship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with still i ascribed this —and rightly ascribed it—to the ﬁerce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked but it was especially the aspe of the three chief oﬃcers of the ship the mates which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colorless misgivings and induce conﬁdence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage ree better more likely seaoﬃcers and men each in his own diﬀerent way could not readily be found and they were every one of them americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerable weather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindiive sort of leaping and melan choly rapidity that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as i levelled my glance towards the taﬀrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarterdeck ere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the re covery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake when the ﬁre has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compaed aged robustness his whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cellini’s cast perseus reading its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rodlike mark lividly whitish it resembled that per pendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running oﬀ into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could cer tainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates but once tashtego’s senior an old gayhead indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old seatraditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradied him when he said that if ever cap tain ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to pass so he muttered—then whoever should do that last oﬃce for the dead would ﬁnd a birthmark on him from crown to sole so powerfully did the whole grim aspe of ahab aﬀe me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the ﬁrst few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale’s jaw “aye he was dismasted oﬀ japan” said the old gayhead indian once “but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it he has a quiver of ’em” i was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of the pequod’s quarter deck and pretty close to the mizen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab stood ere looking straight out beyond the ship’s everpitching prow ere was an inﬁnity of ﬁrmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the ﬁxed and fearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor did his oﬃcers say aught to him though by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye and not only that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a cruciﬁxion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ere long from his ﬁrst visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either standing in his pivot hole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant hol iday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood for as when the redcheeked dancing girls april and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon ﬂowered out in a smile chapter xxvii enter ahab to him stubb some days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic e warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overﬂowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sher bet heaped up—ﬂaked up with rosewater snow e starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the golden helmeted suns for sleeping man ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on ahab’s texture old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death among seacommanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the nightcloaked deck it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks “it feels like going down into one’s tomb”—he would mutter to himself—“for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my gravedug berth” so almost every twentyfour hours when the watches of the night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors ﬂung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturb ing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabinscuttle and ere long the old man would emerge griping at the iron banister to help his crippled way some considerating touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarterdeck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would have been the rever berating crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been of the crunching teeth of sharks but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy lumberlike pace he was measuring the ship from taﬀrail to mainmast stubb the odd second mate came up from below and with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muﬄing the noise hinting something indistinly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou did’st not know ahab then “am i a cannonball stubb” said ahab “that thou wouldst wad me that fash ion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the ﬁlling one at last—down dog and ken nel” starting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly “i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it sir” “avast” gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation “no sir not yet” said stubb emboldened “i will not tamely be called a dog sir” “en be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone or i’ll clear the world of thee” as he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspe that stubb involuntarily retreated “i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it” muttered stubb as he found himself descending the cabinscuttle “it’s very queer stop stubb somehow now i don’t well know whether to go back and strike him or—what’s that—down here on my knees and pray for him yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the ﬁrst time i ever did pray it’s queer very queer and he’s queer too aye take him fore and aft he’s about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he ﬂashed at me—his eyes like powderpans is he mad anyway there’s something on his mind as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the twentyfour and he don’t sleep then didn’t that doughboy the steward tell me that of a morning he always ﬁnds the old man’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a conscience it’s a kind of ticdollyrow they say—worse nor a toothache well well i don’t know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it he’s full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as doughboy tells me he suspes what’s that for i should like to know who’s made appointments with him in the hold ain’t that queer now but there’s no telling it’s the old game—here goes for a snooze damn me it’s worth a fellow’s while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it that’s about the ﬁrst thing babies do and that’s a sort of queer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of ’em but that’s against my principles ink not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfth—so here goes again but how’s that didn’t he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that he might as well have kicked me and done with it maybe he did kick me and i didn’t observe it i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow it ﬂashed like a bleached bone what the devil’s the matter with me i don’t stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming though—how how how—but the only way’s to stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning i’ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by day light” chapter xxviii the pipe when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked in old norse times the thrones of the sealoving danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could one look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the royalty it symbol ized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans was ahab some moments passed during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puﬀs which blew back again into his face “how now” he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube “this smoking no longer soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuring—aye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiﬀs as if like the dying whale my ﬁnal jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe is thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs not among torn irongrey locks like mine i’ll smoke no more—” he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea e ﬁre hissed in the waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the planks chapter xxix queen mab next morning stubb accosted flask “such a queer dream kingpost i never had you know the old man’s ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right oﬀ and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what was still more curious flask—you know how curious all dreams are— through all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from ahab “why” thinks i “what’s the row it’s not a real leg only a false leg” and there’s a mighty diﬀerence between a living thump and a dead thump at’s what makes a blow from the hand flask ﬁfty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane e living member—that makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradiory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself “what’s his leg now but a cane—a whalebone cane yes” thinks i ”it was only a playful cudgelling—in fa only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick be sides” thinks i “look at it once why the end of it—the foot part—what a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me there’s a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down to a point only” but now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badgerhaired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round ”what are you ’bout” says he slid man but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i was over the fright “what am i about” says i at last “and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a kick” by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—“what do you think i saw—why thunder alive man his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second thoughts oqq i guess i won’t kick you old fellow” “wise stubb” said he “wise stubb” and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his “wise stubb wise stubb” i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out “stop that kicking” “halloa” says i “what’s the matter now old fellow” “look ye here” says he “let’s argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didn’t he” “yes he did” says i—“right here it was” “very good” says he—“he used his ivory leg didn’t he” “yes he did” says i “well then” says he “wise stubb what have you to complain of didn’t he kick with right good will it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb it’s an honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garterknights of but be your boast stubb that ye were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say be kicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick back for you can’t help yourself wise stubb don’t you see that pyramid” with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim oﬀ into the air i snored rolled over and there i was in my hammock “now what do you think of that dream flask” “i don’t know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho’” “may be may be but it’s made a wise man of me flask d’ye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let that old man alone never speak to him whatever he says halloa what’s that he shouts hark” “masthead there look sharp all of ye ere are whales hereabouts if ye see a white one split your lungs for him” “what d’ye think of that now flask ain’t there a small drop of something queer about that eh a white whale—did ye mark that man look ye—there’s something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind but mum he comes this way” chapter xxx cetology already we are

herring against linnaeus’s express edi were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan e grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters he states as follows “on account of their warm bilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mam mis laantem” and ﬁnally “ex lege naturae jure meritoque” i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coﬃn of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether

fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respe does the whale diﬀer from other ﬁsh above linnaeus has given you those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other ﬁsh are lungless and cold blooded next how shall we deﬁne the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicu ously to label him for all time to come to be short then a whale is a spouting ﬁsh with a horizontal tail ere you have him however contraed that deﬁn ition is the result of expanded meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a ﬁsh because he is amphibious but the last term of the deﬁnition is still more cogent as coupled with the ﬁrst almost any one must have noticed that all the ﬁsh familiar to landsmen have not a ﬂat but a vertical or upanddown tail whereas among spouting ﬁsh the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position by the above deﬁnition of what a whale is i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identiﬁed with the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any ﬁsh hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien

concerning the oﬃcers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of oﬃcers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whaleﬂeet e large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced by the fa that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the cap tain but was divided between him and an oﬃcer called the specksynder literally this word means fatcutter usage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in those days the captain’s authority was restried to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whalehunting department and all its concerns the specksynder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted title of specksioneer this old dutch oﬃcial is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captain’s more inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good condu of the harpoon eers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important oﬃcer in the boat but under certain circum stances night watches on a whaling ground the command of the ship’s deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distin guished as their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as their social equal now the grand distinion drawn between oﬃcer and man at sea is this—the ﬁrst lives aft the last forward hence in whaleships and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship at is to say they take their meals in the captain’s cabin and sleep in a place indirely com municating with it ough the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend for their proﬁts not upon ﬁxed wages but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive instances live together for all that the punilious externals at least of the quarterdeck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilot cloth and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exaed was implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarterdeck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstances conneed with events hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or in terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to sub serve at certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree re mained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible diatorship for be a man’s intelleual superiority what it will it can never assume the praical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and base is it is that for ever keeps god’s true princes of the empire from the world’s hustings and leaves the highest honors that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their inﬁnite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal in stances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depi mortal indomit ableness in its fullest sweep and dire swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one now alluded to but ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and kings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at

reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying “dinner mr starbuck” disappears into the cabin when the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away and starbuck the ﬁrst emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep into the bin nacle says with some touch of pleasantness “dinner mr stubb” and descends the scuttle e second emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it be all right with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid “dinner mr flask“ follows after his predecessors but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of direions and kicking oﬀ his shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk’s head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahab’s presence in the charaer of abjeus or the slave it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artiﬁcialness of seausages that while in the open air of the deck some oﬃcers will upon pro vocation bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very oﬃcers the next moment go down to their cus tomary dinner in that same commander’s cabin and straightway their inoﬀensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this diﬀerence a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinnertable of invited guests that man’s un challenged power and dominion of individual inﬂuence for the time that man’s royalty of state transcends belshazzar’s for belshazzar was not the greatest who has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be caesar it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration you superadd the oﬃcial supremacy of a shipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sealife just mentioned over his ivoryinlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs in his own proper turn each oﬃcer waited to be served ey were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife as he carved the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned starbuck’s plate towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspeion for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial eleors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the ﬁrst degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man another thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the ﬁrst man up consider for hereby flask’s dinner was badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck ere fore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an oﬃcer from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaion thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach i am an oﬃcer but how i wish i could ﬁst a bit of oldfashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the mast ere’s the fruits of promotion now there’s the vanity of glory there’s the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask’s oﬃcial capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at flask through the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the ﬁrst table in the pequod’s cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary legatees ey made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and mighty cabin in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain’s table was the entire carefree license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it ey dined like lords they ﬁlled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to ﬁll out the vacan cies made by the previous repast often the pale doughboy was fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hopskipandjump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back har poonwise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted doughboy’s memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle pre liminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this breadfaced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing speacle of the black terriﬁc ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages doughboy’s whole life was one continual lipquiver commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing his ﬁled teeth to the indian’s crosswise to them daggoo seated on the ﬂoor for a bench would have brought his hearseplumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diﬀused through so broad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuﬀed in the sublime life of the worlds not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so much so that the trembling doughboy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be picked the simplewitted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden ﬁts of the palsy nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor doughboy how could he forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions alas dough boy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight the three saltsea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous fablemongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbards but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleepingtime when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale cap tains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship’s cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it was something as a streetdoor enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companion ship socially ahab was inaccessible ough nominally included in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age ahab’s soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom chapter xxxiii the masthead it was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seamen my ﬁrst masthead came round in most american whalemen the mastheads are manned almost simultan eously with the vessel’s leaving her port even though she may have ﬁfteen thou sand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three four or ﬁve years’ voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say an empty vial even—then her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till her skysailpoles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more now as the business of standing mastheads ashore or aﬂoat is a very ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here i take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were the old egyptians because in all my researches i ﬁnd none prior to them for though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest masthead in all asia or africa either yet ere the ﬁnal truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of god’s wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a nation of masthead standers is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists that the ﬁrst pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair like formation of all four sides of those ediﬁces whereby with prodigious long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the lookouts of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless standerofmast heads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his post of modern standersofmastheads we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiﬀ gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight ere is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendôme stands with arms folded some one hundred and ﬁfty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great washington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast in baltimore and like one of hercules’ pillars his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gun metal stands his masthead in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be ﬁre but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distraed decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respe the masthead standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole historian of nantucket stands accountable e worthy obed tells us that in the early times of the whale ﬁshery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island ereed lofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a hen house a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymanned boats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea e three mastheads are kept manned from sunrise to sun set the seamen taking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful ere you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes ere you stand lost in the inﬁnite series of the sea with nothing ruﬄed but the waves e tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic aﬄiions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is immutable in one of those southern whalemen on a long three or four years’ voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the masthead would amount to several entire months and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallantmast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called the t’ gallant crosstrees here tossed about by the sea the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns to be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watchcoat but properly speaking the thickest watchcoat is no more of a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its ﬂeshly tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter so a watchcoat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watchcoat concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a south ern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called crow’snests in which the lookouts of a greenland whaler are proteed from the inclement weather of the frozen seas in the ﬁreside narrative of captain sleet entitled “a voyage among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and in cidentally for the rediscovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland” in this admirable volume all standers of mastheads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow’snest of the glacier which was the name of captain sleet’s good craft he called it the sleet’s crow’s nest in honor of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may be get in shape the sleet’s crow’snest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale being ﬁxed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little traphatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his masthead in this crow’s nest of his he tells us that he always had a riﬂe with him also ﬁxed in the rack together with a powder ﬂask and shot for the purpose of popping oﬀ the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very diﬀerent thing now it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’snest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a very scientiﬁc account of his experiments in this crow’snest with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteraing the errors resulting from what is called the “local attrac tion” of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s planks and in the glacier’s case perhaps to there having been so many brokendown blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is very discreet and scientiﬁc here yet for all his learned “binnacle deviations” “azimuth compass observations“ and “approximate errors” he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attraed occasionally towards that well replenished little casebottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest within easy reach of his hand ough upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that casebottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while with mittened ﬁngers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the pole but if we southern whaleﬁshers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seduive seas in which we south ﬁshers mostly ﬂoat for one i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg or any one else oﬀ duty whom i might ﬁnd there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the topsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could i—being left completely to myself at such a thoughtengendering altitude—how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whaleships’ standing orders “keep your weather eye open and sing out every time” and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners of nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant ﬁsheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who oﬀers to ship with the phae don instead of bowditch in his head beware of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can be killed and this sunkeneyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whaleﬁshery furnishes n asylum for many romantic melancholy and absent minded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed whaleship and in moody phrase ejaculates— “roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand blubberhunters sweep over thee in vain” very often do the captains of such ships take those absentminded young philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling suﬃcient “interest” in the voyage halfhinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambi tion as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfe they are shortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve ey have left their operaglasses at home “why thou monkey” said a harpooneer to one of these lads “we’ve been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here” perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an opiumlike listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absentminded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep blue bottom less soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange halfseen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every dimlydiscovered uprising ﬁn of some un discernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually ﬂitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes diﬀused through time and space like cranmer’s sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over ere is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps at midday in the fairest weather with one half throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye pantheists chapter xxxiv the quarterdeck enter ahab en all it was not a great while after the aﬀair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the cabingangway to the deck ere most sea captains usually walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the garden “soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did you ﬁxedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger foot prints—the footprints of his one unsleeping everpacing thought” but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement “d’ye mark him flask” whispered stubb ”the chick that’s in him pecks the shell t’will soon be out” e hours wore on—ahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspe it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the augerhole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft “sir” said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship board except in some extraordinary case ”send everybody aft” repeated ahab “mastheads there come down” when the entire ship’s company were assembled and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bul warks and then darting his eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and halfslouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the won dering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried— “what do ye do when ye see a whale men” “sing out for him” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices “good” cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpeed question had so magnetically thrown them “and what do ye next men” “lower away and after him” “and what tune is it ye pull to men” “a dead whale or a stove boat” more and more strangely and ﬁercely glad and approving grew the counten ance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions but they were all eagerness again as ahab now halfrevolving in his pivot hole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus— “all ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white whale look ye d’ye see this spanish ounce of gold—holding up a broad bright coin to the sun—it is a sixteen dollar piece men d’ye see it mr starbuck hand me yon top maul” while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself produ cing a sound so strangely muﬄed and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him receiving the topmaul from starbuck he advanced towards the mainmast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raises me a whiteheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that whiteheaded whale with three holes punured in his starboard ﬂuke—look ye whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys “huzza huzza” cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the a of nailing the gold to the mast “it’s a white whale” i say resumed ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale “skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out” all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some speciﬁc recolleion “captain ahab” said tashtego “that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick” “moby dick” shouted ahab “do ye know the white whale then tash” “does he fantail a little curious sir before he goes down” said the gay header deliberately “and has he a curious spout too” said daggoo “very bushy even for a par macetty and mighty quick captain ahab” “and he have one two tree—oh good many iron in him hide too captain” cried queequeg disjointedly “all twisketee betwisk like him—him—” faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—” “corkscrew” cried ahab “aye queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual sheepshearing aye tashtego and he fantails like a split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye have seen—moby dick—moby dick” “captain ahab” said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder “captain ahab i have heard of moby dick—but it was not moby dick that took oﬀ thy leg” “who told thee that” cried ahab then pausing “aye starbuck aye my hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye” he shouted with a terriﬁc loud animal sob like that of a heartstricken moose “aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day” en tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out “aye aye and i’ll chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perdition’s ﬂames before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls ﬁn out what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look brave” “aye aye” shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man “a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick” “god bless ye” he seemed to half sob and half shout “god bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but what’s this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for moby dick” “i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captain ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but i came here to hunt whales not my commander’s vengeance how many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market” “nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer if money’s to be the measurer man and the accountants have com puted their great countinghouse the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here” “he smites his chest” whispered stubb what’s that for methinks it rings most vast but hollow“ ”vengeance on a dumb brute“ cried starbuck ”that simply smote thee from blindest instin madness to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous“ ”hark ye yet again—the little lower layer all visible objes man are but as pasteboard masks but in each event—in the living a the undoubted deed—there some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the

is mine cannot oppose me now without rebellion “god keep me—keep us all” murmured starbuck lowly but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow ﬂap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in for again starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails ﬁlled out the ship heaved and rolled as before ah ye

ordered them to produce their weapons en ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ship’s company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian “drink and pass” he cried handing the heavy charged ﬂagon to the nearest

i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings and draw the poles ye harpooneers” silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons some three

clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me ahab’s quenchless feud seemed mine with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale ﬁshermen but not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him while the number who as yet had au ally and knowingly given battle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whalecruisers the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along sol itary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single newstelling sail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances dire and indire long obstrued the spread through the whole worldwide whalingﬂeet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have en countered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to some minds it was not an un fair presumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick yet as of late the sperm whale ﬁshery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the mon ster attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to the perils of the sperm whale ﬁshery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded and as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that spe cies but at length such calamities did ensue in these assaults—not restried to sprained wrists and ancles broken limbs or devouring amputations —but fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and piling their terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake the forti tude of many brave hunters to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra ﬁrma wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale ﬁshery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most direly brought into conta with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you would not come to any chiselled hearthstone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by inﬂuences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and halfformed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he ﬁnally strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw but there were still other and more vital praical inﬂuences at work not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body ere are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in oﬀering battle to the greenland or right whale would perhaps —either from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the amer ican ﬂag who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restried to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childish ﬁre side interest and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we ﬁnd some book naturalists —olassen and povel son—declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time as cuvier’s were these or almost similar impressions eﬀaced for in his natural history the baron himself aﬃrms that at sight of the sperm whale all ﬁsh sharks included are “struck with the most lively terrors” and “often in the precipitancy of their ﬂight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death” and how ever the general experiences in the ﬁshery may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of the hunters so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of the ﬁshermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days of the sperm whale ﬁshery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long praised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man at to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the speciﬁc details of any certain calam ity and without superstitious accompaniments were suﬃciently hardy not to ﬂee from the battle if oﬀered one of the wild suggestings referred to as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had aually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for as the secrets of the cur rents in the seas have never yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradiory speculations regarding them especially con cerning the mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points it is a thing well known to both american and english whaleships and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the paciﬁc in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the nor’ west passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships ﬂoated up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the areth usa fountain near syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whaleman forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for im mortality is but ubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted in his ﬂanks he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable charaer of the monster to strike the imagina tion with unwonted power for it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snowwhite wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump ese were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limit less uncharted seas he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him e rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justiﬁed by his vivid aspe when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his de formed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to speciﬁc accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults more than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known to turn around suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several fatalities had attended his chase but though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the ﬁshery yet in most instances such seemed the white whale’s infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inﬂied by an unintelligent agent judge then to what pitches of inﬂamed distraed fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the white curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal his three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the eddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of the whale at captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping his sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away ahab’s leg as a mower a blade of grass in the ﬁeld no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindiiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intelleual and spiritual exaspera tions e white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung at intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil—ahab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly person iﬁed and made praically assailable in moby dick he piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the pre cise time of his bodily dismemberment en in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably but felt the agonizing bod ily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretched to gether in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad at it was only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the ﬁnal monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fa that at intervals during the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreover intensiﬁed by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there as he sailed raving in his hammock in a straitjacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales and when running into more suﬀerable latitudes the ship with mild stun’sails spread ﬂoated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that ﬁrm colleed front however pale and issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is of tentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it ﬂed it may have but become transﬁgured into some still subtler form ahab’s full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contraed like the unabated hudson when that noble north man ﬂows narrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but as in his narrowﬂowing monomania not one jot of ahab’s broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intelle had perished at before living agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable obje is is much yet ahab’s larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here stand—however grand and wonderful now quit it —and take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of ermes where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful

his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will the old statesecret come now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means are sane my motive and my obje mad yet without power to kill or change or shun the fa he likewise knew that to mankind he did now long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling was only subje to his percept ibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him e report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his ﬁtness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he was all the better qualiﬁed and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and scorched without with the inﬁxed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and allengrossing obje of hunting the white whale had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a ﬁendish man ey were bent on proﬁtable cruises the proﬁt to be counted down in dollars from the mint he was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge here then was this greyheaded ungodly old man chasing with curses a job’s whale round the world at the head of a crew too chieﬂy made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibals—morally enfeebled also by the incom petence of mere unaided virtue or right mindedness in starbuck the invulnerable jollity of indiﬀerence and recklessness in stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so oﬃcered seemed specially picked and packed by some in fernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man’s ire —by what evil magic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the white whale as much their insuﬀerable foe as his how all this came to be—what the white whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in some dim unsus peed way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life—all this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go e subterranean miner that works in us all how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muﬄed sound of his pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiﬀ in tow of a seventyfour can stand still for one i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all arush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill chapter xl the whiteness of the whale what the white whale was to ahab has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineﬀable was it that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all these chapters might be naught ough in many natural objes whiteness reﬁningly enhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles japonicas and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old kings of pegu placing the title “lord of the white elephants” above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snowwhite quadruped in the royal standard and the hanoverian ﬂag bearing the one ﬁgure of a snowwhite charger and the great austrian empire caesarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial color the same imperial hue and though this preeminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness has been even made signiﬁcant of gladness for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many touching noble things—the innocence of brides the benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor though in many climes whiteness typiﬁes the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milkwhite steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the persian ﬁre worshippers the white forked ﬂame being held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythologies great jove himself made incarnate in a snowwhite bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacriﬁce of the sacred white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own ﬁdelity and though direly from the latin word for white all christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and the four andtwenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which aﬀrights in blood is elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any obje terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics what but their smooth ﬂaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are at ghastly whiteness it is which im parts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terriﬁc to the dumb gloating of their aspe so that not the ﬁercefanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the whiteshrouded bear or shark bethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual wonder ment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations not coleridge ﬁrst threw that spell but god’s great unﬂattering laureate nature most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the white steed of the prairies a magniﬁcent milkwhite charger largeeyed smallheaded bluﬀchested and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorn ing carriage he was the eleed xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at their ﬂaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light e ﬂashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silverbeaters could have furnished him a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god bluﬀ bowed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subjes browsing all around at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils red dening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspe he presented himself always to the bravest indians he was the obje of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chieﬂy which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and albatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bears e albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive deformity —and yet this mere aspe of all pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so nor in quite other aspes does nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspe the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white squall nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the eﬀe of that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faion the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiﬀ in the market place nor in some things does the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspe of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a milkwhite fog—yea while these terrors seize us let us add that even the king of terrors when personiﬁed by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse erefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized signiﬁcance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul but though without dissent this point be ﬁxed how is mortal man to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness —though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all dire associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however modiﬁed—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to condu us to the hidden cause we seek let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquain ted with the peculiar charaer of the day does the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of slowpacing pil grims downcast and hooded with newfallen snow or to the unread unsoph isticated protestant of the middle american states why does the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied struures its neighbors —the byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of virginia’s blue ridge is full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespeive of all latitudes and longitudes does the name of the white sea exert such a speralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of central europe does “the tall pale man” of the hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrestingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedraltoppling earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide ﬁeld of leaning spires wrenched cope stones and crosses all adroop like canted yards of anchored ﬂeets and her suburban avenues of housewalls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cards—it is not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangest saddest city thou can’st see for lima has taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that ﬁxes its own distortions i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objes oth erwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be respeively elucidated by the following examples first e mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if by night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still oﬀ soundings heart and helm they both go down he never rests till blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee “sir it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me” second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes and the natural con ceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indiﬀerence views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the ﬁxed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the antaric seas where at times by some infernal trick of leger demain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery views what seems a bound less churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses but thou sayest methinks this whitelead chapter about whiteness is but a white ﬂag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo ishmael tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buﬀalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of aﬀright ere is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils for what knows he this new england colt of the black bisons of distant oregon no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instin of the know ledge of the demonism in the world ough thousands of miles from oregon still when he smells that savage musk the rending goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies which this instant they may be trampling into dust us then the muﬄed rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the fes tooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prair ies all these to ishmael are as the shaking of that buﬀalo robe to the frightened colt ough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist ough in many of its aspes this visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portent ous—why as we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the christian’s deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind is it that by its indeﬁniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immens ities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihil ation when beholding the white depths of the milky way or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color and at the same time the concrete of all colors is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snows—a colorless all color of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly hues—every stately or lovely em blazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterﬂies and the butterﬂy cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile de ceits not aually inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deiﬁed nature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnelhouse within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless in itself and if operating without me dium upon matter would touch all objes even tulips and roses with its own blank tinge—pondering all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in lapland who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes so the wretched inﬁdel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospe around him and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol wonder ye then at the ﬁery hunt with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only arises from the circumstance that the irresponsible fero ciousness of the creature stands invested in the ﬂeece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intens iﬁed terror as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the same qual ity in the polar quadruped is peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that ﬁsh e romish mass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest whence requiem denominating the mass itself and any other funereal music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him re quin i remember the ﬁrst albatross i ever saw it was during a prolonged gale in waters hard upon the antaric seas from my forenoon watch below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark wondrous ﬂutterings and throbbings shook it ough bodily unharmed it uttered cries as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress rough its inex pressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goney i never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is ut terly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i learned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross so that by no possibility could coleridge’s wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine when i saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to be an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirely burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chieﬂy lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotions as when i beheld the antaric fowl but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl ﬂoated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck with the ship’s time and place and then letting it

with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread them before him on his screweddown table en seating himself before it you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank at intervals he would refer to piles of old logbooks beside him wherein were set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead but it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were brought out almost every night some pencil marks were eﬀaced and others were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans before him ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the un hooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to certainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey so assured indeed is the fa concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale’s resorting to given waters that many hunters believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale ﬂeet carefully collated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herringshoals or the ﬂights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to constru elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale besides when making a passage from one feedingground to another the sperm whales guided by some infallible instin—say rather secret intelligence from the deity—mostly swim in veins as they are called continuing their way along a given oceanline with such undeviating exaitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision ough in these cases the direion taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel and though the line of advance be strily conﬁned to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contra but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale ship’s mastheads when circumspely gliding along this magic zone e sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating whales may with great conﬁdence be looked for and hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate feeding grounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest ex panses of water between those grounds he could by his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly without prospe of a meeting ere was a circumstance which at ﬁrst sight seemed to entangle his deliri ous but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality perhaps ough the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which hunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestion able instances where the contrary of this has proved true in general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual stopping places and oceaninns so to speak not his places of prolonged abode and where ahab’s chances of accomplishing his obje have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever wayside antecedent extra prospes were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty at particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the seasonon theline for there and then for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters for awhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predied interval in any one sign of the zodiac ere it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fa above mentioned however ﬂattering it might be to those hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the seasonontheline no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial paciﬁc in time to cruise there erefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequod’s sailing had perhaps been correly seleed by ahab with a view to this very complexion of things because an interval of three hundred and sixtyﬁve days and nights was before him an interval which instead of impa tiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feedinggrounds should turn up his wrinkled brow oﬀ the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampas norwesters harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoom might blow moby dick into the devious zigzag worldcircle of the pequod’s circumnavigating wake but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar snow white brow of moby dick and his snowwhite hump could not but be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries—tallied him and shall he escape his broad ﬁns are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear and here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his lifespot became insuﬀerable anguish and when as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked ﬂames and lightnings shot up and accursed ﬁends beckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room as though escaping from a bed that was on ﬁre yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again e latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the charaerizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent it spontan eously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahab’s case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independent being of its own nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined ﬂed horrorstricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth erefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an obje to color and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature he creates since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by an oﬃcial circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington april th  by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and portions of it are presented in the circular “is chart divides the ocean into distris of ﬁve degrees of latitude by ﬁve degrees

aimed at will naturally follow of itself first i have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has eﬀeed a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where three years intervened between the ﬂinging of the two harpoons and i think it may have been something more than that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with its ﬂanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose is man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respeive marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead ﬁsh in the three year instance it so fell out that i was in the boat both times ﬁrst and last and the last time distinly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale’s eye which i had observed there three years previous i say three years but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are three instances then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as dis tinguished from other whales for however peculiar in that respe any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences of the ﬁshery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most ﬁsher men were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity—nay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinions of a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar was it not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long did’st lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand jack thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tat too land was it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snowwhite cross against the sky was it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back in plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of diﬀerent vessels were ﬁnally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with that express obje as much in view as in setting out through the narragansett woods cap tain butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the indian king philip i do not know where i can ﬁnd a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form estab lishing in all respes the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error so ignorant are most lands men of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without some hints touching the plain fas historical and otherwise of the ﬁshery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory first ough most men have some vague ﬂitting ideas of the general perils of the grand ﬁshery yet they have nothing like a ﬁxed vivid conception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that not one in ﬁfty of the aual disasters and deaths by casualties in the ﬁshery ever ﬁnds a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whaleline oﬀ the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read tomorrow at your breakfast no because the mails are very irregular between here and new guinea in fa did you ever hear what might be called regular news dire or indire from new guinea yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the paciﬁc among many others we spoke thirty diﬀerent ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boat’s crew for god’s sake be economical with your lamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of man’s blood was spilled for it secondly people ashore have indeed some indeﬁnite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when narrating to them some speciﬁc example of this twofold enormousness they have signiﬁc antly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testi mony entirely independent of my own at point is this e sperm whale is in some cases suﬃciently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with dire aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has done it first in the year  the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket was cruising in the paciﬁc ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and bore direly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over not a surviving plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew reached the land in their boats being returned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the paciﬁc in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe secondly e ship union also of nantucket was in the year  totally lost oﬀ the azores by a similar onset but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it irdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j—then command ing an american sloopofwar of the ﬁrst class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gen tlemen present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloopofwar as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very good but there is more coming some weeks after the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments’ conﬁdential business with him that business consisted in fetching the commodore’s craft such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider the com modore’s interview with that whale as providential was not saul of tarsus con verted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now refer you to langsdorﬀ’s voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorﬀ you must know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern’s famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorﬀ thus begins his sev enteenth chapter “by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh e weather was very clear and ﬁne but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water e masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing oﬀ with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain d’wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured” now the captain d’wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston i have the honor of being a nephew of his i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorﬀ he substantiates every word e ship however was by no means a large one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so full too of honest wonders—the voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampier’s old chums—i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langs dorﬀ that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed lionel it seems was on his way to “john ferdinando“ as he calls the modern juan fernandes “in our way thither“ he says “about four o’clock in the morn ing when we were about one hundred and ﬁfty leagues from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground e suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks captain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cabin” lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earth quake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did aually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morn ing the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in more than one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks e english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and se cured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a horse walks oﬀ with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then as not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruion to his pursuers nor is it without convey ing some eloquent indication of his charaer that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several con secutive minutes but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most signiﬁcant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain fas of the present day but that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon —verily there is nothing new under the sun in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate of con stantinople in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius general as many know he wrote the history of his own times a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two particulars not at all aﬀeing the matter presently to be mentioned now in this history of his procopius mentions that during the term of his prefeure at constantinople a great seamonster was captured in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than ﬁfty years a fa thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise species this sea monster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters conneing with it even now i am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious resort but further investigations have recently proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale—squid or cuttleﬁsh—lurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its surface if then you properly put these statements together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning procopius’s seamonster that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale e following are extras from chace’s narrative “every fa seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which direed his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which according to their direion were calculated to do us the most injury by being made ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objes for the shock to eﬀe which the exa manoeuvres which he made were necessary his aspe was most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury he came direly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companions as if ﬁred with revenge for their suﬀerings” again “at all events the whole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions i cannot now recall induce me to be satisﬁed that i am corre in my opinion” here are his reﬂeions some time after quitting the ship during a black night in an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore “e dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjes of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspe and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reﬂeions until day again made its appearance” in another place —p —he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal chapter xliv surmises ough consumed with the hot ﬁre of his purpose ahab in all his thoughts and aions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacriﬁce all mortal interests to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a ﬁery whale man’s ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much more inﬂuential with him it would be reﬁning too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindiiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he mul tiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though not so strily according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by no means incapable of swaying him to accomplish his obje ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for ex ample that however magnetic his ascendency in some respes was over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intelleual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intelleual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation starbuck’s body and star buck’s coerced will were ahab’s so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck’s brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his cap tain’s quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain’s leadership unless some ordinary pruden tial circumstantial inﬂuences were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respeing moby dick was noways more signiﬁcantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background for few men’s courage is proof against protraed meditation unrelieved by aion that when they stood their long night watches his oﬃcers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its ﬁckleness—and when retained for any obje remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employment should intervene and hold them health ily suspended for the ﬁnal dash nor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotion man kind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent e permanent constitutional condition of the manufaured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to ﬁght for their holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way had they been strily held to their one ﬁnal and romantic obje—that ﬁnal and romantic obje too many would have turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all hopes of cash—aye cash ey may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspeive promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prema turely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod’s voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirely laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfe impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all fur ther obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must of course have been most anxious to prote himself at proteion could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric inﬂuence which it was possible for his crew to be subjeed to for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally de veloped here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequod’s voyage observe all customary us ages and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession be all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the three mastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookout and not omit reporting even a porpoise is vigilance was not long without reward chapter xlv the matmaker it was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the leadcolored waters queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a swordmat for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of revery lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat as i kept passing and repassing the ﬁlling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads and idly looking oﬀ upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates ere lay the ﬁxed threads of the warp subje to but one single ever returning

both warp and woof this easy indiﬀerent sword must be chance—aye chance free will and necessity—no wise incompatible—all interweavingly working together e straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate course—its every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads and chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity and sideways in its motions direed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the last featuring blow at events us we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the crosstrees was that mad gayheader tashtego his body was reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemen’s look outs perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indian’s as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries announcing their coming “ere she blows there there there she blows she blows” “whereaway” “on the leebeam about two miles oﬀ a school of them” instantly all was commotion e sperm whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and reli able uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish this ﬁsh from other tribes of his genus “ere go ﬂukes” was now the cry from tashtego and the whales disappeared “quick steward“ cried ahab “time time” doughboy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exa minute to ahab e ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling before it tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward we conﬁdently looked to see them again direly in advance of our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when sounding with his head in one direion he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mills round and swiftly swims oﬀ in the opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in aion for there was no reason to suppose that the ﬁsh seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of the men seleed for shipkeepers—that is those not appointed to the boats by this time relieved the indian at the mainmast head e sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were ﬁxed in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over

themselves on board an enemy’s ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was surrounded by ﬁve dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air “ chapter xlvi the hyena ere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed aﬀair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast praical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspes that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of po tent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun ﬂints and as

unseen and unaccountable old joker at odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribula tion it comes in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke ere is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale its obje ”queequeg“ said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to ﬂing oﬀ the water ”queequeg my ﬁne friend does this sort of thing often happen“ without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such things did often happen “mr stubb“ said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain “mr stubb i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a ﬂying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion“ ”certain i’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale oﬀ cape horn“ “mr flask” said i turning to little kingpost who was standing close by “you are experienced in these things and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this ﬁshery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself backforemost into death’s jaws” “can’t you twist that smaller” said flask “yes that’s the law i should like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that” here then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberate statement of the entire case considering therefore that squalls and capsizings in the wa ter and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chieﬂy to be imputed to starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for his great heedfulness in the ﬁsh ery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbuck’s boat and ﬁnally considering in what a devil’s chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking all things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will “queequeg” said i “come along you shall be my lawyer executor and legatee” it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion is was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart besides all the days i should now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived after his resurreion a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet

stop the plughole with my timber toe oh he’s a wonderful old man“ ”i don’t think it so strange after all on that account“ said flask ”if his leg were oﬀ at the hip now it would be a diﬀerent thing at would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other left you know“ “i don’t know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel“ among whalewise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whal ing captain to jeopardize that life in the aive perils of the chase so tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the ﬁght but with ahab the question assumed a modiﬁed aspe considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary diﬃculties that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt as a general thing the jointowners of the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of aion and giving his orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat aually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt —above all for captain ahab to be supplied with ﬁve extra men as that same boat’s crew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod erefore he had not solicited a boat’s crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter until cabaco’s published discovery the sailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of port all hands had concluded the customary business of ﬁtting the whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making tholepins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced in exaly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee ﬁxed in the semicircular depression in the cleat and with the carpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew being assigned to that boat now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and then such unac countable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ashholes of the earth to man these ﬂoating outlaws of whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blownoﬀ japanese junks and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsub duable excitement in the forecastle but be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were somehow distin from them yet that hairturbaned fedallah remained a muﬄed mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccount able tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahab’s peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort of a half hinted inﬂuence heaven knows but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain an indiﬀerent air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles to the east of the continent—those insulated imme morial unalterable countries which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal generations when the memory of the ﬁrst man was a distin recolleion and all men his descendants unknowing whence he came eyed each other as real phantoms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though according to genesis the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men the devils also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane amours chapter xlviii the spiritspout days weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod had slowly swept across four several cruisinggrounds that oﬀ the azores oﬀ the cape de verdes on the plate so called being oﬀ the mouth of the rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and by their soft suﬀusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea fedallah ﬁrst descried this jet for of these moonlight nights it was his wont to mount to the mainmast head and stand a lookout there with the same precision as if it had been day and yet though herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotions then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew ”ere she blows“ had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it was a most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinively desired a lowering walking the deck with quick sidelunging strides ahab commanded the t’gallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread e best man in the ship must take the helm en with every masthead manned the piledup craft rolled down before the wind e strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taﬀrail breeze ﬁlling the hollows of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two ant agonistic inﬂuences were struggling in her—one to mount dire to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched ahab’s face that night you would have thought that in him also two diﬀerent things were warring while his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coﬃntap on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every sailor swore he saw it once but not a second time is midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared as if it had never been and so it served us night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distin repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested the pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this ﬂitting apparition as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas ese temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urn like prow but at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began howling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there when the ivorytusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of silver chips the foamﬂakes ﬂew over her bulwarks then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights more dismal than before close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us while thick in our rear ﬂew the inscrutable searavens and every morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore ﬁt roostingplace for their homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suﬀering it had bred cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoto as called of yore for long allured by the perﬁdious silences that before had attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea where guilty beings trans formed into those fowls and these ﬁsh seemed condemned to swim on everlast ingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon but calm snowwhite and unvarying still direing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried during all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mates in tempes tuous times like these after everything above and aloft has been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale en captain and crew become praical fatalists so with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one hand ﬁrmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in si lence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that re pose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the old man’s aspe when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his ﬂoorscrewed chair the rain and halfmelted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly drip ping from the unremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand ough the body was ere the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the telltale that swung from a beam in the ceiling terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter xlix the albatross southeastward from the cape oﬀ the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the foremasthead i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean ﬁsheries —a whaler at sea and long absent from home as if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this speral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoarfrost only her lower sails were set a wild sight it was to see her longbearded lookouts at those three mastheads ey seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mastheads of one ship to those of the other yet those forlornlooking ﬁshermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our own lookouts while the quarter deck hail was being heard from below ”ship ahoy have ye seen the white whale” but as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the a of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the ﬁrst mere mention of the white whale’s name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspe that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home he loudly hailed—“ahoy there is is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all future letters to the paciﬁc ocean and this time three years if i am not at home tell them to address them to——“ at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then in ac cordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless ﬁsh that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away with what seemed shuddering ﬁns and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger’s ﬂanks ough in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have no ticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest triﬂes capriciously carry meanings “swim away from me do ye” murmured ahab gazing over into the water ere seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voice—“up helm keep her oﬀ round the world” round the world ere is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation condu only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before us were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strange than any cyc lades or islands of king solomon then there were promise in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed e cabincompass is called the telltale because without going to the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the course of the ship chapter l the gam e ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded her—judging by his subsequent condu on similar occasions—if so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put for as it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for ﬁve minutes with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whalingvessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common cruisingground if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of them cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—oﬀ lone fanning’s island or the far away king’s mills how much more natural i say that under such circum stances these ships should not only interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and sociable conta and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains oﬃcers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about for the long absent ship the outward bounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumbworn ﬁles and in return for that courtesy the outwardbound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruisingground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling ves sels crossing each other’s track on the cruisingground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils nor would diﬀerence of country make any very essential diﬀerence that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case with americans and english ough to be sure from the small number of english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whalers sometimes aﬀe a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of seapeasant but where this superiority in the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the yankees in one day colleively kill more whales than all the english colleively in ten years but this is a harmless little foible in the english whalehunters which the nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the whalers have most reason to be sociable—and they are so whereas some merchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the midatlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in ﬁnical criticism upon each other’s rig as for menofwar when they chance to meet at sea they ﬁrst go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be much rightdown hearty good will and brotherly love about it at all as touching slaveships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates when they chance to cross each other’s crossbones the ﬁrst hail is—“how many skulls”—the same way that whalers hail—“how many barrels” and that question once answered pirates straightway steer apart for they are infernal villains on both sides and don’t like to see overmuch of each other’s villanous likenesses but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable freeand easy whaler what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather she has a “gam” a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuﬀ about “spouters” and “blubber boilers” and such like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchantseamen and also all pirates and manofwar’s men and slaveship sailors cherish such a scornful feeling towards whaleships this is a question it would be hard to answer because in the case of pirates say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on but what is a gam you might wear out your indexﬁnger running up and down the columns of diionaries and never ﬁnd the word dr johnson never attained to that erudition noah webster’s ark does not hold it nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some ﬁfteen thousand true born yankees certainly it needs a deﬁnition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view let me learnedly deﬁne it g noun—a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally on a cruising ground when after exchanging hails they exchange visits by boats’ crews the two captains remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates on the other ere is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so has the whale ﬁshery in a pirate manofwar or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons but the whaleboat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whaleboat never admits of any such eﬀeminacy and therefore as in gam ming a complete boat’s crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled oﬀ to his visit all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projeing steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the afteroar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up en again it would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes it would never do i say for this strad dling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant selfcommand he generally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets but perhaps being gener ally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s hair and hold on there like grim death chapter li the townho’s story as told at the golden inn e cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part it was not very long after speaking the goney that another homewardbound whaleman the townho was encountered she was manned almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the townho’s story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men is latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the townho himself it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunions of secresy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an inﬂuence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod’s main mast interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange aﬀair i now proceed to put on lasting record for my humor’s sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one saint’s eve smoking upon the thickgilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those ﬁne cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time “some two years prior to my ﬁrst learning the events which i am about rehears ing to you gentlemen the townho sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your paciﬁc here not very many days’ sail westward from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common ey supposed a swordﬁsh had stabbed her gentlemen but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though in deed they could not ﬁnd it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired ”ough no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favored he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the townho had all but certainly arrived in perfe safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal over bearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buﬀalo lakeman—buﬀalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buﬀalo“ said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass ”on the eastern shore of our lake erie don but—i crave your courtesy—may be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentlemen in square sail brigs and threemasted ships wellnigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the landlocked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions pop ularly conneed with the open ocean for in their interﬂowing aggregate those grand freshwater seas of ours—erie and ontario and huron and superior and michigan—possess an oceanlike expansiveness with many of the ocean’s noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes ey contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations as the atlantic is they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dot ted all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goatlike craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the ﬂeet thunderings of naval viories at intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces ﬂash from out their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are ﬂanked by ancient and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand

capitals of buﬀalo and cleveland as well as winnebago villages they ﬂoat alike the fullrigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew us gentlemen though an inlander steelkilt was wildocean born and wildocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative paciﬁc yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latit udes of buckhorn handled bowieknives yet was this nantucketer a man with some goodhearted traits and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inﬂexible ﬁrmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave’s right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and steelkilt—but gentlemen you shall hear “it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven that the townho’s leak seemed again increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the oﬃcer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respe the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is aﬀorded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious ”much this way had it been with the townho so when her leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless un thinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen erefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overﬂowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlemen—that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupperholes now as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours —watery or otherwise that when a person placed in command over his fellowmen ﬁnds one of them to be very signiﬁcantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that sub altern’s tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a ﬂowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to charlemagne’s father but radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman aﬀeed not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings aye aye my merry lads it’s a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and let’s have a taste by the lord it’s worth bottling i tell ye what men old rad’s investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home e fa is boys that sword ﬁsh only began the job he’s come back again with a gang of ship carpenters sawﬁsh and ﬁleﬁsh and what not and the whole posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i suppose if old rad were here now i’d tell him to jump overboard and scatter ’em ey’re playing the devil with his estate i can tell him but he’s a simple old soul—rad and a beauty too boys they say the rest of his property is invested in lookingglasses i wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose damn your eyes what’s that pump stopping for“ roared radney pretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk ”under away at it“ “aye aye sir” said steelkilt merry as a cricket “lively boys lively now” and with that the pump clanged like ﬁfty ﬁreengines the men tossed their hats oﬀ to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s utmost energies “quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went for ward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face ﬁery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now what cozening ﬁend it was gentlemen that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that cor poreally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some oﬀensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large now gentlemen sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships aually foundering at the time such gentlemen is the inﬂexibility of seausages and the instinive love of neatness in seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without ﬁrst washing their faces but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the townho that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not conneed with truly nautical duties such being the case with his comrades i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exaly how this aﬀair stood between the two men “but there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spat in his face any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his com mand but as he sat still for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powdercasks heaped up in him and the slow match silently burning along towards them as he instinively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt ”erefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his ﬁrst nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conﬂagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding “steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest eﬀe by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned oﬀ the foolish and infatuated man but it was to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the oﬃcer “mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to your self” but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the lakeman stood ﬁxed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insuﬀerable malediions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unﬂinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale “ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads ey were both canallers “canallers” cried don pedro “we have seen many whaleships in our harbors but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are they” “canallers don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of it” “nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but little of your vigorous north” “aye well then don reﬁll my cup your chicha’s very ﬁne and ere proceed ing further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may throw sidelight upon my story” “for three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and aﬄuent cultivated ﬁelds unrivalled for fertility by billiardroom and barroom through the holyofholies of great forests on roman arches over indian rivers through sun

in holiest vicinities” “is that a friar passing” said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern “well for our northern friend dame isabella’s inquisition wanes in lima” laughed don sebastian “proceed senor” “a moment pardon” cried another of the company “in the name of all us limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this coast—“corrupt as lima“ it but bears out

antony for days and days along his greenturfed ﬂowery nile he indolently ﬂoats openly toying with his redcheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this eﬀeminacy is dashed e brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports his slouched and gailyribboned hat betoken his grand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he ﬂoats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from one of these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiﬀ an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whaleﬁshery contains so many of its most ﬁnished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian cornﬁeld and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas “i see i see “ impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruﬄes “no need to travel e world’s one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hills—but the story“ “i left oﬀ gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four har pooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harm’s way the vali ant captain danced up and down with a whalepike calling upon his oﬃcers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarterdeck at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the obje of his resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass these seaparisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade “come out of that ye pirates” roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward “come out of that ye cut throats” steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there deﬁed the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to understand distinly that his steelkilt’s death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty “will you promise not to touch us if we do” demanded their ringleader “turn to turn to—i make no promise—to your duty do you want to sink the ship by knocking oﬀ at a time like this turn to” and he once more raised a pistol “sink the ship” cried steelkilt “aye let her sink not a man of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a ropeyarn against us what say ye men“ turning to his comrades a ﬁerce cheer was their response “e lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking out such sentences as these—“it’s not our fault we didn’t want it i told him to take his hammer away it was boy’s business he might have known me before this i told him not to prick the buﬀalo i believe i have broken a ﬁnger here against his cursed jaw ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word don’t be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and we’re your men but we won’t be ﬂogged” “turn to i make no promises turn to i say” “look ye now” cried the lakeman ﬂinging out his arm towards him “there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise d’ye see now as you well know sir we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we don’t want a row it’s not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we won’t be ﬂogged” “turn to” roared the captain “steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then said—”i tell you what it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till you say the word about not ﬂogging us we won’t do a hand’s turn“ ”down into the forecastle then down with ye i’ll keep ye there till ye’re sick of it down ye go“ ”shall we“ cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave ”as the lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway en opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it and turned the key upon them—ten in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral “all night a wideawake watch was kept by all the oﬃcers forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship ”at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarterdeck twice every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuﬄing was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to e fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terriﬁc hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the ﬁfth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them only three were left “better turn to now” said the captain with a heartless jeer “shut us up again will ye” cried steelkilt “oh certainly” said the captain and the key clicked “it was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defeion of seven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle at each end run a muck from the bowsprit to the taﬀrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not at was the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender and what was more they each insisted upon being the ﬁrst man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader as ﬁercely objeed reserving that priority for himself particularly as his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of them could not be ﬁrst for the ladder would but admit one man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out “upon hearing the frantic proje of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the ﬁrst of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such condu might merit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the captain at midnight” “inking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perﬁdious allies who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till morning “damn ye” cried the captain pacing to and fro before them “the vultures would not touch ye ye villains” “at sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to ﬂog them all round—thought upon the whole he would do so —he ought to—justice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular” “but as for you ye carrion rogues” turning to the three men in the rig ging—“for you i mean to mince ye up for the trypots“ and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two cruciﬁed thieves are drawn” “my wrist is sprained with ye” he cried at last “but there is still rope enough left for you my ﬁne bantam that wouldn’t give up take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself” “for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head” said in a sort of hiss “what i say is this—and mind it well—if you ﬂog me i murder you” “say ye so then see how ye frighten me”—and the captain drew oﬀ with the rope to strike “best not” hissed the lakeman “but i must”—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope said“i won’t do it—let him go—cut him down d’ye hear” but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested them—radney the chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe “you are a coward” hissed the lakeman “so i am but take that” e mate was in the very a of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of steelkilt’s threat whatever that might have been e three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaties cuﬀs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at steelkilt’s instigation they had resolved to maintain the striest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thing—namely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the townho still maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a ﬁsh that moment as on the day his craft ﬁrst struck the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passive ness in their condu he kept his own counsel at least till all was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the vent ricles of his heart he was in radney the chief mate’s watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ship’s side in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed ere was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below “what are you making there” said a shipmate “what do you think what does it look like” “like a lanyard for your bag but it’s an odd one seems to me” “yes rather oddish” said the lakeman holding it at arm’s length before him “but i think it will answer shipmate i haven’t enough twine—have you any” “but there was none in the forecastle” “en i must get some from old rad” and he rose to go aft “you don’t mean to go a begging to him” said a sailor “why not do you think he won’t do me a turn when it’s to help himself in the end shipmate” and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was given him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman’s monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow twentyfour hours after his trick at the silent helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come and in the foreordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in “but gentlemen a fool saved the wouldbe murderer from the bloody deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done” it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriﬀe man drawing water in the mainchains all at once shouted out “ere she rolls there she rolls” jesu what a whale it was moby dick “moby dick” cried don sebastian “st dominic sir sailor but do whales have christenings whom call you moby dick” “a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don—but that would be too long a story” “how how” cried all the young spaniards crowding “nay dons dons—nay nay i cannot rehearse that now let me get more into the air sirs” “e chicha the chicha” cried don pedro “our vigorous friend looks faint—ﬁll up his empty glass” “no need gentlemen one moment and i proceed”—now gentlemen so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within ﬁfty yards of the ship—forgetful of the compa among the crew—in the excitement of the moment the teneriﬀe man had instinively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast heads all was now a phrensy “e white whale—the white whale“ was the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumors were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a ﬁsh while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted e mutineer was the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a ﬁsh it was his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were lowered the mate’s got the start and none howled more ﬁercely with delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a stiﬀ pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whale’s topmost back nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate at instant as he fell on the whale’s slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed over into the sea on the other ﬂank of the whale he struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down ”meantime at the ﬁrst tap of the boat’s bottom the lakeman had slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terriﬁc downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he cut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of radney’s red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the whale eluded them and ﬁnally wholly disappeared in good time the townho reached her port—a savage solitary place—where no civilized creature resided ere headed by the lakeman all but ﬁve or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double war canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor e ship’s company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put oﬀ with them in so heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his oﬃcers he anchored the ship as far oﬀ shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whaleboat steered straight before the wind for tahiti ﬁve hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked warcanoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam “what do you want of me” cried the captain “where are you bound and for what are you bound” demanded steelkilt “no lies” “i am bound to tahiti for more men” “very good let me board you a moment—i come in peace” with that he leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain “cross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six days if i do not may lightnings strike me” “a pretty scholar” laughed the lakeman“adios senor” and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrades “watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoanut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own place of destination ere luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for france and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed ey embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution ”some ten days after the french ships sailed the whaleboat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and ﬁnding all right there again resumed his cruisings where steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of nan tucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him “are you through” said don sebastian quietly “i am don” “en i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own conviions this story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to press” “also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don sebastian’s suit” cried the company with exceeding interest “is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn gentlemen” “nay” said don sebastian “but i know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised this may grow too serious” “will you be so good as to bring the priest also don” “ough there are no autodafes in lima now” said one of the company to another “i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy let us withdraw more out of the moonlight i see no need for this” “excuse me for running after you don sebastian but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists you can” “is is the priest he brings you the evangelists” said don sebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn ﬁgure let me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it“ so help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told ye gentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to be true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew

terrapin chapter lii of the monstrous pictures of whales i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he aually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day conﬁdently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such piures of the whale all wrong it may be that the primal source of all those piorial delusions will be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of chainarmor like saladin’s and a helmeted head like st george’s ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not only in most popular piures of the whale but in many scientiﬁc presentations of him now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale’s is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda of elephanta in india e brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were pre ﬁgured ages before any of them aually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth e hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depiing the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small seion of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic ﬂukes but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian painter’s portrait of this ﬁsh for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo it is guido’s piure of perseus rescuing andromeda from the sea monster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his own “perseus descending” make out one whit better e huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on its back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be taken for the traitors’ gate leading from the ames by water into the tower en there are the prodromus whales of the old scotch sibbald and jonah’s whale as depied in the prints of old bibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as for the bookbinder’s whale winding like a vinestalk round the stock of a descending anchor —as stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and new—that is a very piuresque but purely fabulous creature imitated i take it from the like ﬁgures on antique vases ough universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this bookbinder’s ﬁsh an attempt at a whale because it was so intended when the device was ﬁrst introduced it was introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the th century during the revival of learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets d’eau hot springs and cold saratoga and badenbaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the titlepage of the original edition of the “ad vancement of learning” you will ﬁnd some curious whales but quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those piures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientiﬁc delineations by those who know in old harris’s colleion of voyages there are some plates of whales extraed from a dutch book of voyages a d  entitled “a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale peter peterson of friesland master” in one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among iceisles with white bears running over their living backs in another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular ﬂukes en again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled “a voyage round cape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries” in this book is an outline purporting to be a “piure of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august  and hoisted on deck” i doubt not the captain had this veracious piure taken for the beneﬁt of his marines to mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bowwindow some ﬁve feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the beneﬁt of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake look at that popular work “goldsmith’s animated nature” in the abridged london edition of  there are plates of an alleged “whale” and a “narwhale” i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriﬀ could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys en again in  bernard germain count de lacepède a great naturalist published a scientiﬁc systemized whale book wherein are several piures of the diﬀerent species of the leviathan all these are not only incorre but the piure of the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its counterpart in nature but the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientiﬁc frederick cuvier brother to the famous baron in  he pub lished a natural history of whales in which he gives what he calls a piure of the sperm whale before showing that piure to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuvier’s sperm whale is not a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the beneﬁt of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that piure who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientiﬁc predecessor in the same ﬁeld desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that is from a chinese draw ing and what sort of lively lads with the pencil those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us as for the signpainters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oildealers what shall be said of them ey are generally richard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners their deformities ﬂoundering in seas of blood and blue paint but these manifold mistakes in depiing the whale are not so very surprising after all consider most of the scientiﬁc drawings have been taken from the stranded ﬁsh and these are about as corre as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars ough elephants have stood for their fulllengths the living leviathan has never yet fairly ﬂoated himself for his portrait e living whale in his full majesty and signiﬁcance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and aﬂoat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched lineof battle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations and not to speak of the highly presumable diﬀerence of contour between a young sucking whale and a full grown platonian leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship’s deck such is then the outlandish eellike limbered varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not at all for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape ough jeremy bentham’s skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors correly conveys the idea of a burlybrowed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremy’s other leading personal charaeristics yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan’s articulated bones in fa as the great hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the inse does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it is peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously displayed in the side ﬁn the bones of which almost exaly answer to the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb is ﬁn has four regular boneﬁngers the index middle ring and little ﬁnger but all these are permanently lodged in their ﬂeshy covering as the human ﬁngers in an artiﬁcial covering “however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us” said humorous stubb one day “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens” for all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs con clude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than an other but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exaness so there is no earthly way of ﬁnding out precisely what the whale really looks like and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan chapter liii of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the pictures of whaling scenes in connexion with the monstrous piures of whales i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier c but i pass that matter by i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale colnett’s huggins’s frederick cuvier’s and beale’s in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to huggins’s is far better than theirs but by great odds beale’s is the best all beale’s drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle ﬁgure in the piure of three whales in various attitudes capping his second chapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably corre and lifelike in its general eﬀe some of the sperm whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty corre in contour but they are wretchedly engraved at is not his fault though of the right whale the best outline piures are in scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he has but one piure of whaling scenes and this is a sad deﬁciency because it is by such piures only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters but taken for all in all by far the ﬁnest though in some details not the most corre presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found are two large french engravings well executed and taken from paintings by one garnery respeively they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale in the ﬁrst engraving a noble sperm whale is depied in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terriﬁc wreck of the stoven planks e prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the monster’s spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable ﬂash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the a of leaping as if from a precipice e aion of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true e halfemptied linetub ﬂoats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of aﬀright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i could not draw so good a one in the second engraving the boat is in the a of drawing alongside the barnacled ﬂank of a large running right whale that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from the patagonian cliﬀs his jets are ere full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shell ﬁsh and other sea candies and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back and all the while the thicklipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of tumultu ous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiﬀ caught nigh the paddlewheels of an ocean steamer us the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the ﬂag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepole inserted into his spouthole who garnery the painter is or was i know not but my life for it he was either praically conversant with his subje or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman e french are the lads for painting aion go and gaze upon all the paintings in europe and where will you ﬁnd such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder ﬁghts his way pellmell through the consecutive great battles of france where every sword seems a ﬂash of the northern lights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a charge of crowned centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea battlepieces of garnery e natural aptitude of the french for seizing the piuresqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of england’s experience in the ﬁshery and not the thousandth part of that of the americans they have nevertheless fur nished both nations with the only ﬁnished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things such as the vacant proﬁle of the whale which so far as piuresqueness of eﬀe is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the proﬁle of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving us a stiﬀ full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck sub mits to the inspeion of a shivering world ninetysix fac similes of magniﬁed aric snow crystals i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager i honor him for a veteran but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn aﬃdavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace in addition to those ﬁne engravings from garnery there are two other french engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself “h durand” one of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts it is a quiet noonscene among the isles of the paciﬁc a french whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air e eﬀe is very ﬁne when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy ﬁshermen under one of their few aspes of oriental repose e other engraving is quite a diﬀerent aﬀair the ship hoveto upon the open sea and in the very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the vessel in the a of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing oﬀ from this scene of aivity is about giving chase to whales in the distance e harpoons and lances lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands halfere out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the aivity of the excited seamen chapter liv of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheet in stone in mountains in stars on towerhill as you go down to the london docks you may have seen a crippled beggar or kedger as the sailors say holding a painted board before him repres enting the tragic scene in which he lost his leg ere are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale any time these ten years they tell me has that man held up that piure and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justiﬁcation has now come his three whales are as good whales as were ever

whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation roughout the paciﬁc and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and whalingscenes graven by the ﬁshermen themselves on sperm whaleteeth or ladies’ busks wrought out of the right whale bone and other like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hours of ocean leisure some of them have little boxes of dentisticallooking implements specially intended for the skrimshandering busi ness but in general they toil with their jackknives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariner’s fancy long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him i e what is called savagery your true whalehunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against him now one of the peculiar charaeristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian warclub or spear paddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon for with but a bit of broken seashell or a shark’s tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden network has been achieved and it has cost steady years of steady application as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailorsavage with the same marvellous patience and with the same single shark’s tooth of his one poor jack knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the greek savage achilles’s shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that ﬁne old dutch savage albert durer wooden whales or whales cut in proﬁle out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea warwood are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers some of them are done with much accuracy at some old gableroofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the roadside door when the porter is sleepy the anvilheaded whale would be best but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on the spires of some oldfashioned churches you will see sheetiron whales placed there for weather cocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with “hands oﬀ” you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken cliﬀs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petriﬁed forms of the leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges en again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the proﬁles of whales deﬁned along the undulat ing ridges but you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exa interseing latitude and longitude of your ﬁrst standpoint else so chance like are such observations of the hills that your precise previous stand point would require a laborious rediscovery like the solomon islands which still remain incognita though once highruﬀed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them nor when expandingly lifted by your subje can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long ﬁlled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds us at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that ﬁrst deﬁned him to me and beneath the eﬀulgent antaric skies i have boarded the argonavis and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish with a frigate’s anchors for my bridle bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight chapter lv brit steering northeastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadows of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale largely feeds for leagues and leagues it undulated round us so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless ﬁelds of ripe and golden wheat on the second day numbers of right whales were seen who secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing ﬁbres of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip as morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so these monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all re minded one of mowers seen from the mastheads especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else and as in the great hunting countries of india the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even so often with him who for the ﬁrst time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea and even when recognised at last their immense mag nitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instin in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse indeed in other respes you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore for though some old natural ists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for example does the ocean furnish any ﬁsh that in disposi tion answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog e accursed shark alone can in any generic respe be said to bear comparative analogy to him but though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superﬁcial western one though by vast odds the most terriﬁc of all mortal disasters have immemorially and in discriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters though but a moment’s consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill and however much in a ﬂattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiﬀest frigate he can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impres sions man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it e ﬁrst boat we read of ﬂoated on an ocean that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow at same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year yea foolish mortals noah’s ﬂood is not yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers wherein diﬀer the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is also a ﬁend to its own oﬀspring worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs so the sea dashes even the mighti est whales against the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships no mercy no power but its own controls it panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider the masterless ocean overruns the globe consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creatures glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks consider once more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each other carrying on eternal war since the world began consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile earth consider them both the sea and the land and do

encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life god keep thee push not oﬀ from that isle thou canst never return at part of the sea known among whalemen as the “brazil banks” does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there being shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkable meadowlike appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continually ﬂoating in those latitudes where the right whale is often chased chapter lvi squid slowly wading through the meadows of brit the pequod still held on her way northeastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain and still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when the long burn ished sun glade on the waters seemed a golden ﬁnger laid across them enjoining some secresy when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spere was seen by daggoo from the main masthead in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snow slide new slid from the hills us glistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank en once more arose and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on reappearing once more with a stilettolike cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled out—“ere there again there she breaches right ahead e white whale the white whale” upon this the seamen rushed to the yardarms as in swarmingtime the bees rush to the boughs bareheaded in the sultry sun ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helms man cast his eager glance in the direion indicated aloft by the outstretched mo tionless arm of daggoo whether the ﬂitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab so that he was now prepared to conne the ideas of mildness and repose with the ﬁrst sight of the particular whale he pursued however this was or whether his eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering e four boats were soon on the water ahab’s in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing creamcolor lay ﬂoating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any hapless obje within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instin but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chancelike apparition of life as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimed—“almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost” “what was it sir“ said flask “e great live squid which they say few whaleships ever beheld and re turned to their ports to tell of it“ but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have conneed with the sight of this obje certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food for though other species of whales ﬁnd their food above water and may be seen by man in the a of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that food consists at times when closely pursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length ey fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it ere seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontop podan may ultimately resolve itself into squid e manner in which the bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he nar rates in all this the two correspond but much abatement is necessary with respe to the incredible bulk he assigns it by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttleﬁsh to which indeed in certain external respes it would seem to belong but only as the anak of the tribe chapter lvii the line with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented i have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whaleline e line originally used in the ﬁshery was of the best hemp slightly vapored with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinary ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable to the ropemaker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiﬀen the whaleline for the close coiling to which it must be subjeed but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar in general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength however much it may give it companess and gloss of late years the manilla rope has in the american ﬁshery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and i will add since there is an aesthetics in all things is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a goldenhaired circassian to behold e whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness at ﬁrst sight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment its one and ﬁfty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons in length the common sperm whale line measures something over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the wormpipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheeseshaped mass of densely bedded “sheaves” or layers of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the “heart” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebody’s arm leg or entire body oﬀ the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the a of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs ere is some advantage in this because these twintubs being so small they ﬁt more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly three feet in diameter and of propor tionate depth makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfinch in thickness for the bottom of the whaleboat is like critical ice which will bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concen trated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling oﬀ with a prodigious great weddingcake to present to the whales both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eyesplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything is arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts first in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry oﬀ the entire line originally attached to the harpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the ﬁrst boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort second is arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea and in that case no towncrier would ever ﬁnd her again before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called boxline being coiled upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft and is then attached to the shortwarp—the rope which is immediately conneed with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the shortwarp goes through sundry mystiﬁcations too tedious to detail us the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direion all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortal woman for the ﬁrst time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habit —strange thing what cannot habit accomplish—gayer sallies more merry mirth better jokes and brighter repartees you never heard over your mahogany than you will hear over the halfinch white cedar of the whaleboat when thus hung in hangman’s nooses and like the six burghers of calais before king edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death with a halter around every neck as you may say perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steamengine in full play when every ﬂying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you it is worse for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning and only by a certain selfadjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and aion can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with where the allseeing sun himself could never pierce you out again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless riﬂe holds the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into aual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspe of this dangerous aﬀair but why say more all men live enveloped in whalelines all are born with halters round their necks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortals realize the silent subtle everpresent perils of life and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whaleboat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before your evening ﬁre with a poker and not a harpoon by your side chapter lviii stubb kills a whale if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents to queequeg it was quite a diﬀerent obje “when you see him ’quid” said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat “then you quick see him ’parm whale” e next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to en gage them the pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voy aging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it aﬀords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins ﬂyingﬁsh and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those oﬀ the rio de la plata or the inshore ground oﬀ peru it was my turn to stand at the foremasthead and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long after the power which ﬁrst moved it is withdrawn ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizen mastheads were already drowsy so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman e waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty fathoms oﬀ a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon but that pipe poor whale was thy last as if struck by some enchanter’s wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great ﬁsh slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air “clear away the boats luﬀ” cried ahab and obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes e sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set presently as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly ﬂitted his tail forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up “ere go ﬂukes” was the cry an announcement immediately followed by stubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honor of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play and still puﬃng at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault yes a mighty change had come over the ﬁsh all alive to his jeopardy he was going “head out” that part obliquely projeing from the mad yeast which he brewed “start her start her my men don’t hurry yourselves take plenty of time—but start her start her like thunderclaps that’s all” cried stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke “start her now give ’em the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boy—start her all but keep cool keep cool—cucumbers is the word—easy easy—only start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boys —that’s all start her” “woohoo wa hee” screamed the gayheader in reply raising some old war whoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild “keehee kee hee” yelled daggoo straining forwards and backwards on his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage “kala kooloo” howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of grenadier’s steak and thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puﬃng the smoke from his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heard— “stand up tashtego—give it to him” e harpoon was hurled “stern all” e oarsmen backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists it was the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb’s hands from which the handcloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemy’s sharp two edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch “wet the line wet the line” cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching oﬀ his hat dashed the seawater into it more turns were taken so that the line began holding its place e boat now ﬂew through the boiling water like a shark all ﬁns stubb and tashtego here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keels— one cleaving the water the other the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little ﬁnger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea us they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and paciﬁcs seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his ﬂight “haul in —haul in” cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his ﬂank stubb ﬁrmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the ﬂying ﬁsh at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow and then ranging up for another ﬂing e red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake e slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reﬂeion into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puﬀ after puﬀ from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale “pull up—pull up” he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath “pull up—close to” and the boat ranged along the ﬁsh’s ﬂank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the ﬁsh and kept it there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the ﬁsh and now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “ﬂurry” the monster horribly wallowed in his blood over wrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day and now abating in his ﬂurry the whale once more rolled out into view sur ging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contraing his spouthole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless ﬂanks into the sea his heart had burst “he’s dead mr stubb” said daggoo “yes both pipes smoked out” and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thought fully eyeing the vast corpse he had made it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire in terior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists ough apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cutwater formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluﬀbowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilotboat partly to show the indispensableness of this a it may here be stated that in the old dutch ﬁshery a mop was used to dash the running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most convenient chapter lix the dart a word concerning an incident in the last chapter according to the invariable usage of the ﬁshery the whaleboat pushes oﬀ from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremost oar the one known as the harpooneeroar now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the ﬁrst iron into the ﬁsh for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to be ﬂung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer is expeed to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he is expeed to set an example of superhuman aivity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one’s compass while all the other muscles are strained and half started—what that is none know but those who have tried it for one i cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this straining bawling state then with his back to the ﬁsh all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry— “stand up and give it to him” he now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole ﬂeet of whalemen in a body that out of ﬁfty fair chances for a dart not ﬁve are successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them aually burst their bloodvessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expe to ﬁnd it there when most wanted again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else it is then they change places and the headsman the chief oﬃcer of the little craft takes his proper station in the bows of the boat now i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish and unnecessary e headsman should stay in the bows from ﬁrst to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing whatever should be expeed of him except under circumstances obvious to any ﬁsherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the ﬁshery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them to insure the greatest eﬃciency in the dart the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from out of toil chapter lx the crotch out of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs so in produive subjes grow the chapters e crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projes from the prow ereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his riﬂe from the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch respeively called the ﬁrst and second irons but these two harpoons each by its own cord are both conneed with the line the obje being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it is a doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the ﬁrst iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightninglike in his movements to pitch the second iron into him nevertheless as the second iron is already conneed with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently praicable but this critical a is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodi gious sensation in all direions nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one un usually strong aive and knowing whale when owing to these qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the ﬁrst one be ineﬀeually darted without recovery all these particulars are faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be painted chapter lxi stubb’s supper stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men with our thirtysix arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and ﬁngers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hangho or whatever they call it in china four or ﬁve laborers on the footpath will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with piglead in bulk darkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequod’s mainrigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning ough in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had evinced his customary aivity to call it so yet now that the creature was dead some vague dissatisfaion or impatience or despair seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac obje very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod’s decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the portholes but by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the two—ship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while the other remains standing if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known on deck stubb his second mate ﬂushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still goodnatured excitement such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck his oﬃcial superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole man agement of aﬀairs one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a ﬂavorish thing to his palate “a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small” here be it known that though these wild ﬁshermen do not as a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you ﬁnd some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body about midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstanhead as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb the only banqueter on whale’s ﬂesh that night mingling their mumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness e few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers’ hearts peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head is particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of all things e mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw ough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seaﬁght sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butchers over the decktable are thus can nibally carving each other’s live meat with carvingknives all gilded and tasselled the sharks also with their jewel hilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole af fair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instances might be set down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will ﬁnd them in such countless numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devilworship and the expediency of conciliating the devil but as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips “cook cook—where’s that old fleece” he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing with his lance “cook you cook—sail this way cook“ e old black not in any very high glee at having been previously routed from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something the matter with his kneepans which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuﬄing and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old ebony ﬂoundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb’s sideboard when with both hands folded before him and resting on his twolegged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring his best ear into play “cook“ said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone you’ve been beating this steak too much cook it’s too tender don’t i always say that to be good a whalesteak must be tough ere are those sharks now over the side don’t you see they prefer it tough and rare what a shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to ’em tell ’em they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet blast me if i can hear my own voice away cook and deliver my message here take this lantern” snatching one from his sideboard “now then go and preach to ’em” sullenly taking the oﬀered lantern old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light low over the sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly ﬂourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that was said “fellowcritters i’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare you hear stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip massa stubb say dat you can ﬁll your dam bellies up to de hatchings but by gor you must stop dat dam racket” “cook” here interposed stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder—“cook why damn your eyes you mustn’t swear that way when you’re preaching at’s no way to convert sinners cook” “who dat den preach to him yourself” sullenly turning to go “no cook go on go on” “well den belubed fellow critters—” “right” exclaimed stubb approvingly “coax ’em to it try that” and fleece continued “do you is all sharks and by natur wery woracious yet i zay to you fellow critters dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de tail how you tink to hear ’spose you keep up such a dam slappin’ and bitin’ dare” “cook” cried stubb collaring him “i wont have that swearing talk to ’em gentlemanly” once more the sermon proceeded “your woraciousness fellowcritters i don’t blame ye so much for dat is natur and can’t be helped but to gobern dat wicked natur dat is de pint you is sharks sartin but if you gobern de shark in you why den you be angel for all angel is not’ing more dan de shark well goberned now look here bred’ren just try wonst to be cibil a helping

the benediion fleece and i’ll away to my supper” upon this fleece holding both hands over the ﬁshy mob raised his shrill voice and cried— “cussed fellowcritters kick up de damndest row as ever you can ﬁll your dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die” “now cook” said stubb resuming his supper at the capstan “stand just where you stood before there over against me and pay particular attention” “all dention” said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position “well” said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile “i shall now go back to the subje of this steak in the ﬁrst place how old are you cook” “what dat do wid de ’teak” said the old black testily “silence how old are you cook” “’bout ninety dey say” he gloomily muttered “and have you lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook and don’t know yet how to cook a whalesteak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that that morsel seemed a continuation of the question where were you born cook” “’hind de hatchway in ferryboat goin’ ober de roanoke” “born in a ferryboat at’s queer too but i want to know what country you were born in cook” “didn’t i say de roanoke country” he cried sharply “no you didn’t cook but i’ll tell you what i’m coming to cook you must go home and be born over again you don’t know how to cook a whalesteak yet” “bress my soul if i cook noder one” he growled angrily turning round to depart “come back cook—here hand me those tongs—now take that bit of steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be take it i say” —holding the tongs towards him—“take it and taste it” faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro muttered “best cooked ’teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy” “cook” said stubb squaring himself once more “do you belong to the church” “passed one once in capedown” said the old man sullenly “and you have once in your life passed a holy church in capetown where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow creatures have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh” said stubb “where do you expe to go to cook” “go to bed berry soon” he mumbled halfturning as he spoke “avast heave to i mean when you die cook it’s an awful question now what’s your answer” “when dis old brack man dies” said the negro slowly changing his whole air and demeanor “he hisself won’t go nowhere but some bressed angel will come and fetch him” “fetch him how in a coach and four as they fetched elijah and fetch him where” “up dere” said fleece holding his tongs straight over his head and keeping it there very solemnly “so then you expe to go up into our maintop do you cook when you are dead but don’t you know the higher you climb the colder it gets maintop eh” “didn’t say dat t’all” said fleece again in the sulks “you said up there didn’t you and now look yourself and see where your tongs are pointing but perhaps you expe to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber’s hole cook but no no cook you don’t get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging it’s a ticklish business but must be done or else it’s no go but none of us are in heaven yet drop your tongs cook and hear my orders do ye hear hold your hat in one hand and clap t’other a’top of your heart when i’m giving my orders cook what that your heart there—that’s your gizzard aloft aloft—that’s it—now you have it hold it there now and pay attention” “all ’dention” said the old black with both hands placed as desired vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time “well then cook you see this whalesteak of yours was so very bad that i have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that don’t you well for the future when you cook another whale steak for my private table here the capstan i’ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other that done dish it d’ye hear and now tomorrow cook when we are cutting in the ﬁsh be sure you stand by to get the tips of his ﬁns have them put in pickle as for the ends of the ﬂukes have them soused cook ere now ye may go” but fleece had hardly got three paces oﬀ when he was recalled “cook give me cutlets for supper to morrow night in the midwatch d’ye hear away you sail then —halloa stop make a bow before you go—avast heaving again whaleballs for breakfast—don’t forget” “wish by gor whale eat him ’stead of him eat whale i’m bressed if he ain’t more of shark dan massa shark hisself” muttered the old man limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock a little item may as well be related here e strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the ﬂukes or tail and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the sideﬁns its ﬂexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it but this diﬃculty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden ﬂoat at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden ﬂoat is to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the made whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junion with its broad ﬂukes or lobes chapter lxii the whale as a dish at mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it it is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large prices there also that in henry viiith’s time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered ﬁne eating e meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtleballs or veal balls e old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them ey had a great porpoise grant from the crown e fa is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous doors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel—that these men aually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among the dutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters” which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old amsterdam housewives’ doughnuts or oly cooks when fresh ey have such an eatable look that the most selfdenying stranger can hardly keep his hands oﬀ but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look at his hump which would be as ﬁne eating as the buﬀalo’s which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent halfjellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their shipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus made in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a ﬁne dish e casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings they are then mixed with ﬂour and cooked into a most deleable mess in ﬂavor somewhat resembling calves’ head which is quite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures by continually dining upon calves’ brains by and by get to have a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calf’s head from their own heads which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf’s head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see e head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an “et tu brute” expression it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned i e that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the ﬁrst man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the meatmarket of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy patédefoiegras but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding insult to injury is it look at your knifehandle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining oﬀ that roast beef what is that handle made of—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens “ chapter lxiii cutting in it was a saturday night and such a sabbath as followed ex oﬃcio professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen e ivory pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would have thought we were oﬀering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods in the ﬁrst place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the maintop and ﬁrmly lashed to the lower masthead the strongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck e end of the hawserlike rope winding through these intricacies was then condued to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached and now suspended in stages over the side starbuck and stubb the mates armed with their long spades began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two sideﬁns is done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her frighted mastheads to the sky more and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the ﬁrst strip of blubber now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange so is it stripped oﬀ from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels oﬀ along the line called the ”scarf“ simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled oﬀ and indeed by that very a itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the maintop the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blood dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon called a boardingsword and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a con siderable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blub ber in order to prepare for what follows whereupon this accomplished swords man warning all hands to stand oﬀ once more makes a scientiﬁc dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanket piece swings clear and is all ready for lowering e heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down goes the ﬁrst strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber room into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the mates scarﬁng the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friion chapter lxiv the blanket i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subje the skin of the whale i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen aﬂoat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion remains unchanged but it is only an opinion e question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you know what his blubber is at blubber is something of the consistence of ﬁrm close grained beef but tougher more elastic and compa and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and ﬁfteen inches in thickness now however preposterous it may at ﬁrst seem to talk of any creature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point of fa these are no arguments against such a presumption because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale’s body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape oﬀ with your hand an inﬁnitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass only it is almost as ﬂexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contras and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whale books it is transparent as i said before and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying inﬂuence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whales through their own speacles as you may say but what i am driving at here is this at same inﬁnitely thin isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a newborn child but no more of this assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuﬀ of the whale’s skin in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks in thick array something like those in the ﬁnest italian line engravings but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in some instances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but aﬀord the ground for far other delineations ese are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular i was much struck with a plate representing the old indian charaers chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi like those mystic rocks too the mysticmarked whale remains undecipherable is allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his ﬂanks eﬀaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspe i should say that those new england rocks on the seacoast which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping conta with vast ﬂoating icebergs —i should say that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile conta with other whales for i have most remarked them in the large full grown bulls of the species a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale it has already been said that it is stript from him in long pieces called blanketpieces like most seaterms this one is very happy and signiﬁcant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides what would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other ﬁsh are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters but these be it observed are your coldblooded lungless ﬁsh whose very bellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn ﬁre whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood freeze his blood and he dies how wonderful is it then —except after explanation—that this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lips for life in those aric waters where when seamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of ﬁelds of ice as a ﬂy is found glued in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer it does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare virtue of interior spacious ness oh man admire and model thyself after the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood ﬂuid at the pole like the great dome of st peter’s and like the great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature of thine own but how easy and how hopeless to teach these ﬁne things of ereions how few are domed like st peter’s of creatures how few vast as the whale chapter lxv the funeral ”haul in the chains let the carcase go astern” e

should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientiﬁc anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subje and that subje almost hidden in a discolored rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the ﬂesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much as getting one single peep into the evercontraing gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdied parts and exaly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull do you not marvel then at stubb’s boast that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale when ﬁrst severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped at done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whale’s head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers’ scales e pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element and there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower masthead and every yardarm on that side projeing like a crane over the waves there that blooddripping head hung to the pequod’s waist like the giant holofernes’s from the girdle of judith when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone from his cabin taking a few turns on the quarterdeck he paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the mainchains he took stubb’s long spade—still remaining there after the whale’s decapitation—and striking it into the lower part of the half suspended mass placed its other end crutchwise under one arm and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively ﬁxed on this head it was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the sphynx’s in the desert “speak thou vast and venerable head” muttered ahab “which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell us the secret thing that is in thee of all divers thou hast dived the deepest that head upon which the upper sun now gleams has moved amid this world’s foundations where unrecorded names and navies rust and untold hopes and anchors rot where in her

there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are wanted hereand then again hands are wanted there ere is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was mentioned that upon ﬁrst breaking ground in the whale’s back the blubberhook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get ﬁxed in that hole it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to but in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole ﬂensing or stripping operation is concluded e whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer ﬂounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg ﬁgured in the highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him as will presently be seen being the savage’s bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard scrabble scramble upon the dead whale’s back you have seen italian organboys holding a dancingape by a long cord just so from the ship’s steep side did i hold queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the ﬁshery a monkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist it was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before we pro ceed further it must be said that the monkeyrope was fast at both ends fast to queequeg’s broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down to his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinly to perceive that my own indi viduality was now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death erefore i saw that here wa a sort of interregnum in providence for its even handed equity never could have sanioned so gross an injustice and yet still further pondering—while i jerked him now and then from between the whale and the ship which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals if your banker breaks you nap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly es cape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequeg’s monkeyrope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only had the management of it i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to ﬂow from the carcase—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushed them aside with his foundering feet a thing altogether incredible were it not that attraed by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous ﬁnger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them accordingly besides the monkeyrope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarily ferocious shark—he was provided with still another proteion suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego and daggoo continually ﬂourished over his head a couple of keen whalespades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach is procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and benevolent of them ey meant queequeg’s best happiness i admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the bloodmuddied water those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer to amputating a leg than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods well well my dear comrade and twinbrother thought i as i drew in and then slacked oﬀ the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world at unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands him—what some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water “ginger do i smell ginger” suspiciously asked stubb coming near “ yes this must be ginger” peering into the as yet untasted cup then standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying “ginger ginger and will you have the goodness to tell me mr dough boy where lies the virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use doughboy to kindle a ﬁre in this shivering cannibal ginger—what the devil is ginger—seacoal ﬁre wood—lucifer matches—tinder—gunpowder—what the devil is ginger i say that you oﬀer this cup to our poor queequeg here” “ere is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business” he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just come from forward “will you look at the kannakin sir smell of it if you please” en watching the mate’s countenance he added “e steward mr starbuck had the face to oﬀer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant oﬀ the whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a halfdrowned man” “i trust now” said starbuck “it is poor stuﬀ enough” “ayeaye steward” cried stuﬀ “we’ll teach you to drug a harpooneer none of your apothecary’s medicine here you want to poison us do ye you have got our insurances on our lives and want to murder us all and pocket the proceeds do ye” “it was not me” cried doughboy “it was

with ye to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr starbuck it is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale” “enough” replied starbuck “only don’t hit him again but–” “oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellow’s a weasel what were you about saying sir” “only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself” when stubb reappeared he came with a dark ﬂask in one hand and a sort of teacaddy in the other e ﬁrst contained strong spirits and was handed to queequeg the second was aunt charity’s gift and that was freely given to the waves chapter lxviii stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have over him it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale’s prodigious head hanging to the pequod’s side but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it for the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity oﬀered nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats stubb’s and flask’s were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast head but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight in the a of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at ﬁrst it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from view as if diving under the keel “cut cut“ was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side but having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direion and still plied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to take them under but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so ﬂinging oﬀ its drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were free to ﬂy but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close ﬂanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale’s body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his ﬂukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensued between them ”i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard” said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan “wants with it“ said flask coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale’s head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whale’s on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize“ “why not“ “i don’t know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ships’ charms but i sometimes think he’ll charm the ship to no good at last i don’t half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake’s head stubb“ “sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there flask“—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands—“aye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship he’s the devil i say e reason why you don’t see his tail is because he tucks it up out of

hammock but i’ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging“ “no doubt and it’s because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the eye of the rigging“ “what’s the old man have so much to do with him for“ “striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose“ “bargain—about what“ “why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then he’ll surrender moby dick“ “pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that“ “i don’t know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the old ﬂagship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he was at home and asked the devil what he wanted e devil switching his hoofs up and says “i want john“ “what for“ says the old governor “what business is that of yours“ says the devil getting mad—“i want to use him“ “take him“ says the governor—and by the lord flask if the devil didn’t give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him i’ll eat this whale in one mouthful but look sharp—aint you all ready there well then pull ahead and let’s get the whale alongside“ “i think i remember some such story as you were telling“ said flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship “but i can’t remember where“ “ree spaniards adventures of those three bloody minded soldadoes did ye read it there flask i guess ye did no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was the same you say is now on board the pequod“ “am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesn’t the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a latchkey to get into the admiral’s cabin don’t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask“ “how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb“ “do you see that mainmast there“ pointing to the ship “well that’s the ﬁgure one now take all the hoops in the pequod’s hold and string ’em along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldn’t begin to be fedallah’s age nor all the coopers in creation couldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts enough“ “but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a sea toss if you got a good chance now if he’s so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that“ “give him a good ducking anyhow“ “but he’d crawl back“ “duck him again and keep ducking him“ “suppose he should take it into his head to duck you though—yes and drown you—what then“ “i should like to see him try it i’d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil flask do you suppose i’m afraid of the devil who’s afraid of him except the old governor who daresn’t catch him and put him in doubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped he’d roast for him ere’s a governor“ “do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab“ “do i suppose it you’ll know it before long flask but i am going now to keep a sharp lookout on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on i’ll just take him by the nape of his neck and say—look here beelzebub you don’t do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord i’ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short oﬀ at the stump—do you see and then i rather guess when he ﬁnds himself docked in that queer fashion he’ll sneak oﬀ without the poor satisfaion of feeling his tail between his legs“ “and what will you do with the tail stubb“ “do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get home —what else“ “now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb“ “mean or not mean here we are at the ship“ e boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where ﬂuke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him “didn’t i tell you so“ said flask “yes you’ll soon see this right whale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s“ in good time flask’s saying proved true as before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale’s head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in locke’s head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant’s and you come back again but in very poor plight us some minds for ever keep trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunderheads overboard and then you will ﬂoat light and right in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut oﬀ whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crownpiece but nothing like this in the present case had been done e carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the headladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow while if the parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen ahab’s as the crew toiled on laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things chapter lxix the sperm whale’s head—contrasted view here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join them and lay together our own of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy ey are the only whales regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale as the external diﬀerence between them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod’s side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deck—where i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study praical cetology than here in the ﬁrst place you are struck by the general contrast between these heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale’s which the right whale’s sadly lacks ere is more charaer in the sperm whale’s head as you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt color of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what the ﬁshermen technically call a ”greyheaded whale“ let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely the two most important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whale’s jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colt’s eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes it is plain that he can never see an obje which is exaly ahead no more than he can one exaly astern in a word the position of the whale’s eyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objes through your ears you would ﬁnd that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideline of sight and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a man—what indeed but his eyes moreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to produce one piure and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whale’s eyes eﬀeually di vided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separ ate the impressions which each independent organ imparts e whale therefore must see one distin piure on this side and another distin piure on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man may in eﬀe be said to look out on the world from a sentrybox with two joined sashes for his window but with the whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distin windows but sadly impairing the view is peculiarity of the whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the ﬁshery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with a hint so long as a man’s eyes are open in the light the a of seeing is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objes are before him nevertheless any one’s experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and com pletely to examine any two things—however large or however small—at one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two objes and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your con temporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes in themselves must simultaneously a but is his brain so much more comprehens ive combining and subtle than man’s that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distin prospes one on one side of him and the other in an exaly opposite direion if he can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distin problems in euclid nor strily investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the ex traordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirely proceeds from the helpless perplexity of vo lition in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads for hours and never discover that organ e ear has no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respe to their ears this important diﬀerence is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former has an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare’s but if his eyes were broad as the lens of herschel’s great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing not at all—why then do you try to ”enlarge“ your mind subtilize it let us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cant over the sperm whale’s head so that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what a really beautiful and chaste looking mouth from ﬂoor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as bridal satins but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuﬀbox with a hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terriﬁc portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the ﬁshery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale ﬂoating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some ﬁfteen feet long hanging straight down at rightangles with his body for all the world like a ship’s jibboom is whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjaws upon him in most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a praised artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extraing the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the ﬁshermen fash ion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrellastocks and handles to ridingwhips with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an an chor and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other work —queequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth with a keen cuttingspade queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands ere are generally fortytwo teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor ﬁlled after our artiﬁcial fashion e jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joists for building houses ” chapter lxx the batteringram ere quitting for the nonce the sperm whale’s head i would have you as a sensible physiologist simply —particularly remark its front aspe in all its compaed colleedness i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram power may be lodged there here is a vital point for you must either satisfaorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an inﬁdel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boomlike lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whale’s head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent eﬀeminacy in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange just so with the head but with this diﬀerence about the head this envelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who has not handled it e severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses’ hoofs i do not think that any sensation lurks in it bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the sailors do ey do not suspend between them at the point of coming conta any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of oxhide at bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crowbars by itself this suﬃciently illustrates the obvious fa i drive at but supplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that as ordinary ﬁsh possess what is called a swimming bladder in them capable at will of distension or contraion and as the sperm whale as far as i know has no such provision in him considering too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstrued elasticity of its envelop considering the unique interior of his head it has hypothetically occurred to me i say that those mystical lungcelled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspeed connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraion if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and destruive of all elements contributes now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a mass of tremend ous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is —by the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest inse so that when i shall hereafter de tail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsider able braining feats i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic with the paciﬁc you would not elevate one hair of your eyebrow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter how small the chances for the provincials then what befel the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess’s veil at sais chapter lxxi the great heidelburgh tun now comes the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal struure of the thing operated upon regarding the sperm whale’s head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony struure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance e lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand inﬁltrated cells of tough elastic white ﬁbres throughout its whole extent e upper part known as the case may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages namely the highlyprized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state nor is this pre cious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature ough in life it remains perfely ﬂuid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begins to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the ﬁrst thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whale’s case generally yields about ﬁve hun dred gallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can i know not with what ﬁne and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearlcolored membrane like the line of a ﬁne pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm whale’s case it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and since—as has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twentysix feet for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship’s side as in decapitating the whale the operator’s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents it is this decap itated end of the head also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter us much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous and—in this particular instance —almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale’s great heidelburgh tun is tapped quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics i know not that it has been deﬁned before a quoin is a solid which diﬀers from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both sides chapter lxxii cistern and buckets nimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his ere posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyardarm to the part where it exaly projes over the hoisted tun he has carried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two parts travelling through a singlesheaved block securing this block so that it hangs down from the yard arm he swings one end of the rope till it is caught and ﬁrmly held by a hand on deck en handoverhand down the other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head ere—still high elevated above the rest of the company to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower a shorthandled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasurehunter in some old house sounding the walls to ﬁnd where the gold is masoned in by the time this cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like a wellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hands ese last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person has reached up a very long pole inserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling like a dairymaid’s pail of new milk carefully lowered from its height the fullfreighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub en re mounting aloft it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been ﬁlled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wild indian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his onehanded hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reasons how it was exaly there is no telling now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up—my god poor tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped head foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight “man overboard” cried daggoo who amid the general consternation ﬁrst came to his senses “swing the bucket this way” and putting one foot into it so as the better to secure his slippery handhold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom meantime there was a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea as if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing the whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles —a sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg e one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head “come down come down” yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he would still re main suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out “in heaven’s name man” cried stubb “are you ramming home a cartridge there —avast how will that help him jamming that ironbound bucket on top of his head avast will ye” “stand clear of the tackle” cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket almost in the same instant with a thunder boom the enormous mass dropped into the sea like niagara’s tablerock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath as half swinging—now over the sailors’ heads and now over the water—daggoo through a thick mist of spray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor buriedalive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away when a naked ﬁgure with a boardingsword in its hand was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks e next a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the side and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little oﬀ from the ship “ha ha” cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch over head and looking further oﬀ from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave “both both—it is both —”cried daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego was long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out our poor tash by the head he averred that upon ﬁrst thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and might occasion great trouble—he had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somer set upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old way—head foremost as for the great head itself that was doing as well as could be expeed and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was successfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing i know that this queer adventure of the gayheader’s will be sure to seem in credible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom hap pens and with much less reason too than the indian’s considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whale’s well but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought the tissued inﬁltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater speciﬁc gravity than itself we have thee there not at all but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well —a double welded hammered substance as i have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteraed by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed aﬀording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say yes it was a running delivery so it was now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perish ing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coﬃned hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanum sanorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be recalled—the delicious death of an ohio honeyhunter

manipulated the dome of the pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats of the various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces of horses birds serpents and ﬁsh and

physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he has no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modiﬁes and ﬁnally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external append age must very largely aﬀe the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated openwork belfry of the nose dash the nose from phidias’s marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the same deﬁciency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jollyboat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reﬂeion that he has a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne in some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head is aspe is sublime in

the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely ampliﬁed that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other obje in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one distin feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper nothing but that one broad ﬁrmament of a forehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men nor in proﬁle does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in proﬁle you plainly perceive that horizontal semicrescentic depression in the forehead’s middle which in man is lavater’s mark of genius but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deiﬁed by their childmagian thoughts they deiﬁed the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no tongue or as least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright the merry mayday gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to jove’s high seat the great sperm whale shall lord it champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man’s and every being’s face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whale’s brow i but put that brow before you read if it you can chapter lxxiv the nut if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square in the fullgrown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is as the side view of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base but in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is angularly ﬁlled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long ﬂoor of this crater—in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain e brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the ampliﬁed fortiﬁcations of quebec so like a choice casket is it secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine lying in strange folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the creature’s living inta state is an entire delusion as for his true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any e whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common world if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of men’s skulls and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would say—is man had no self esteem and no veneration and by those negations considered along with the aﬃrmative fa of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea for you if you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine you will be struck with the re semblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudi mental resemblance to the skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it the germans were not the ﬁrst men to perceive a foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo the beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a man’s charaer will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as in the ﬁrm audacious staﬀ of that ﬂag which i ﬂing half out to the world apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial cav ity is continuous with the ﬁrst neckvertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being eight in height and of a triangular ﬁgure with the base downwards as it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course this canal is ﬁlled with much the same strangely ﬁbrous substance— the spinal cord—as the brain and direly communicates with the brain and what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brain’s cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically for viewed in this light the wonderful com parative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the sperm whale’s hump is august hump if i mistake not rises over one of the larger vertebrae and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it from its relative situ ation then i should call this high hump the organ of ﬁrmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know chapter lxxv the pequod meets the virgin e predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick de deer master of bremen at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and germans are now among the least but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with their ﬂag in the paciﬁc for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respes while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern “what has he in his hand there” cried starbuck pointing to something wav ingly held by the german “impossible—a lampfeeder” “not that“ said stubb “no no it’s a coﬀeepot mr starbuck he’s coming oﬀ to make us our coﬀee is the yarman don’t you see that big tin can there alongside of him—that’s his boiling water oh he’s all right is the yarman“ “go along with you” cried flask “it’s a lamp feeder and an oilcan he’s out of oil and has come a begging” however curious it may seem for an oil ship to be borrowing oil on the whale ground and however much it may invertedly contradi the old proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably condu a lampfeeder as flask did declare as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lampfeeder and oil can with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness—his last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single ﬂyingﬁsh yet captured to supply the deﬁciency concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically called a clean one that is an empty one well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin his necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gained his ship’s side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mastheads of both ves sels and so eager for the chase was derick that without pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeeders now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequod’s keels ere were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their ﬂanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness ey left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yel lowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed aﬄied with the jaundice or some other inﬁrmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed ques tionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him because the whitebone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet his spout was short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending it self in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble “who’s got some paregoric” said stubb “he has the stomachache i’m afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomachache adverse winds are holding mad christmas in him boys it’s the ﬁrst foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be he’s lost his tiller” as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous ribends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard ﬁn whether he had lost that ﬁn in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say “only wait a bit old chap and i’ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm” cried cruel flask pointing to the whale line near him “mind he don’t sling thee with it” cried starbuck “give way or the german will have him” with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one ﬁsh because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time at this junure the pequod’s keel had shot by the three german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had derick’s boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rivals e only thing they feared was that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him as for derick he seemed quite conﬁdent that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lampfeeder at the other boats “e ungracious and ungrateful dog” cried starbuck “he mocks and dares me with the very poorbox i ﬁlled for him not ﬁve minutes ago”—then in his old intense whisper— “give way greyhounds dog to it” “i tell ye what it is men”—cried stubb to his crew—“it’s against my religion to get mad but i’d like to eat that villanous yarman—pull—won’t ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come why don’t some of ye burst a bloodvessel who’s that been dropping an anchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch —we’re becalmed halloo here’s grass growing in the boat’s bottom—and by the lord the mast there’s budding is won’t do boys look at that yarman e short and long of it is men will ye spit ﬁre or not” “oh see the suds he makes” cried flask dancing up and down—“what a hump—ohdo pile on the beef—lays like a log oh my lads do spring—slap jacks and quohogs for supper you know my lads—baked clams and muﬃns—oh do do spring—he’s a hundred barreler—don’t lose him now —don’t oh don’t—see that yarman—oh won’t ye pull for your duﬀ my lads—such a sog such a sog ger don’t ye love sperm ere goes three thousand dollars men—a bank—a whole bank e bank of england—oh do do do—what’s that yarman about now” at this moment derick was in the a of pitching his lampfeeder at the ad vancing boats and also his oilcan perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals’ way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the mo mentary impetus of the backward toss “e unmannerly dutch dogger” cried stubb “pull now men like ﬁfty thousand lineofbattleship loads of redhaired devils what d’ye say tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in twoandtwenty pieces for the honor of old gayhead what d’ye say” “i say pull like goddam” —cried the indian fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the german the pequod’s three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him in that ﬁne loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of “ere she slides now hurrah for the whiteash breeze down with the yarman sail over him” but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the vior in this race had not a righteous judgment des cended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his whiteash and while in consequence derick’s boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage—that was a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the german’s quarter an instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whale’s immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the foaming swell that he made it was a terriﬁc most pitiable and maddening sight e whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor ﬁn beat his side in an agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering ﬂight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodic ally sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating ﬁn so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making aﬀrighted broken circles in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod’s boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three ti gers—queequeg tashtego daggoo—instinively sprang to their feet and stand ing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket irons entered the whale blind ing vapors of foam and whiteﬁre e three boats in the ﬁrst fury of the whale’s headlong rush bumped the german’s aside with such force that both derick and his baﬄed harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three ﬂying keels “don’t be afraid my butterboxes” cried stubb casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by “ye’ll be picked up presently—all right—i saw some sharks astern—st bernard’s dogs you know—relieve distressed travellers hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrah—here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar is puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain—makes the wheelspokes ﬂy boys when you fasten to him that way and there’s danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going to davy jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail but the monster’s run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines ﬂew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpoon eers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the leadlined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three sterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a little ticklish but though boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this “holding on“ as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live ﬂesh from the back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale something less than  square feet—the pressure of the water is immense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here aboveground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bear ing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must at least equal the weight of ﬁfty atmospheres one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty lineofbattle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and to what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said—“canst thou ﬁll his skin with barbed irons or his head with ﬁsh spears e sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot make him ﬂee darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear“ is the creature this he oh that unfulﬁlments should follow the prophets for with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea to hide him from the pequod’s ﬁshspears in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes’ army who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms ﬂitting over his head “stand by men he stirs” cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinly conduing upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat e next moment relieved in a great part from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small iceﬁeld will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea “haul in haul in” cried starbuck again “he’s rising” e lines of which hardly an instant before not one hand’s breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils ﬂung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two ship’s lengths of the hunters his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land anim als there are certain valves or ﬂoodgates in many of their veins whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut oﬀ in certain direc tions not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire nonvalvular struure of the bloodvessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great dis tance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will ﬂow whose source is in the wellsprings of faroﬀ and undiscernible hills even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying ﬂukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spouthole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its aﬀrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life as they signiﬁcantly call it was untouched as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whale’s eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see but pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridals and other merrymakings of men and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoﬀensiveness by all to all still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discolored bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the ﬂank “a nice spot” cried flask “just let me prick him there once” “avast” cried starbuck “there’s no need of that” but humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than suﬀerable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing flask’s boat and marring the bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently ﬂapped with his stumped ﬁn then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn oﬀ from some mighty fountain and with halfstiﬂed melancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unriﬂed immediately by starbuck’s orders lines were secured to it at diﬀerent points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiﬀest ﬂukechains for it was plain that unless artiﬁcially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom it so chanced that almost upon ﬁrst cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his ﬂesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the ﬂesh perfely healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fa of a lancehead of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the ﬂesh perfely ﬁrm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor’ west indian long before america was discovered what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the body’s im mensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering of aﬀairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with the body then when the command was given to break clear from it such was the immovable strain upon the timberheads to which the ﬂukechains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them oﬀ meantime everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house e ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable ﬂukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over “hold on hold on won’t ye” cried stubb to the body “don’t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife and cut the big chains” “knife aye aye” cried queequeg and seizing the carpenter’s heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest ﬂuke chains but a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain eﬀeed the rest with a terriﬁc snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing nor has any ﬁsherman yet adequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale ﬂoats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and brokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sink ing is caused by an uncommon speciﬁc gravity in the ﬁsh so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut oﬀ in the warm ﬂush and may of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty right whales do is diﬀerence in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a lineofbattle ship could hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequod’s mastheads announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a finback belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its incredible power of swimming nevertheless the finback’s spout is so similar to the sperm whale’s that by unskilful ﬁshermen it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute e virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase oh many are the finbacks and many are the dericks my friend chapter lxxvi the honor and glory of whaling ere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method e more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up to the very springhead of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honor ableness and antiquity and especially when i ﬁnd so many great demigods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinion upon it i am transported with the reﬂeion that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity e gallant perseus a son of jupiter was the ﬁrst whaleman and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said that the ﬁrst whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent ose were the knightly days of our pro fession when we only bore arms to succor the distressed and not to ﬁll men’s lampfeeders every one knows the ﬁne story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the seacoast and as leviathan was in the very a of carrying her oﬀ perseus the prince of whale men intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very ﬁrst dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaﬀa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skel eton of a whale which the city’s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this it was from joppa that jonah set sail akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda—indeed by some sup posed to be indirely derived from it—is that famous story of st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other “ou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea” saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtra from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coﬃn have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griﬃn like shape and though the battle is depied on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as in perseus’ case st george’s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or seahorse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to hold this socalled dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fa placed before the stri and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that ﬁsh ﬂesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horse’s head and both the palms of his hands fell oﬀ from him and only the stump or ﬁshy part of him remained us then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore let not the knights of that honorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st george’s decoration than they whether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i long remained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that antique crockett and kit carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strily makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere appears that he ever aually harpooned his ﬁsh unless indeed from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for one of our clan but by the best contradiory authorities this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly they are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not the prophet nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal kings of old times we ﬁnd the headwaters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves at wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lord—vishnoo who by the ﬁrst of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and saniﬁed the whale when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of praical hints to young archites these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo there’s a memberroll for you what club but the whaleman’s can head oﬀ like that chapter lxxvii jonah historically regarded reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less fas for all that one old sagharbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the hebrew story was this—he had one of those quaint old fashioned bibles embellished with curious unscientiﬁc plates one of which represented jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head —a peculiarity only true with respe to a species of the le viathan the right whale and the varieties of that order concerning which the ﬁshermen have this saying “a penny roll would choke him” his swallow is so very small but to this bishop jebb’s anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right whale’s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist tables and comfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the right whale is toothless another reason which sagharbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices but this objeion likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the ﬂoating body of a dead whale—even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has been divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway eﬀeed his es cape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a ﬁgurehead and i would add possibly called “e whale” as some craft are nowadays christened the “shark” the “gull” the “eagle” nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life preserver—an inﬂated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom poor sag harbor therefore seems worsted all round but he had still another reason for his want of faith it was this if i remember right jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days’ journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast how is that but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak of the tigris waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in besides this idea of jonah’s weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar but all these foolish arguments of old sagharbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonah’s going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magniﬁcation of the general miracle and so it was besides to this day the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harris’s voyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil “ chapter lxxviii the fountain at for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages be fore—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so many sprinkling or mistify ing pots and that for some centuries back thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute ﬁfteen and a quarter minutes past one o’clock p m of this sixteenth day of december a d  it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but vapor —this is surely a noteworthy thing let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items contingent every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills the ﬁnny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise its head above the surface but owing to his marked internal struure which gives him regular lungs like a human being’s the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head if i say that in any creature breathing is only a funion indispensable to vi tality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element which being sub sequently brought into conta with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think i shall err though i may possibly use some superﬂuous scientiﬁc words assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time at is to say he would then live without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who system atically lives by intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicellilike vessels which vessels when he quits the surface are completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs e anatomical fa of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the sup position founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out as the ﬁshermen phrase it is is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exaly uniform with all his other unmolested risings say he stays eleven minutes and jets seventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again to a minute now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those seventy breaths are told will he ﬁnally go down to stay out his full term below remark however that in diﬀerent individuals these rates are diﬀerent but in any one they are alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it too that this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter as the great necessities that strike the viory to thee in man breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spouthole if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spouthole and being so clogged with two elements it could not be expeed to have the power of smelling but owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no proper olfaories but what does he want of them no roses no violets no colognewater in the sea furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal and as that long canal—like the grand erie canal—is furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chieﬂy intended as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid down in a city on one side of a street but the question returns whether this gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirely communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water but the sperm whale’s food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will ﬁnd that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subje speak out you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely e central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him and if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superﬁcially lodged in the spouthole ﬁssure which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head for even when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm with his elevated hump sundried as a dromedary’s in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock ﬁlled up with rain nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering into it and putting his face in it you cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and ﬁll it and bring it away for even when coming into slight conta with the outer vapory shreds of the jet which will often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer conta with the spout whether with some scientiﬁc obje in view or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled oﬀ from his cheek and arm wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you e wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadly spout alone still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides other reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fa that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goes up a certain semivisible steam while in the a of thinking deep thoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reﬂeed there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head e invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicable contemplations and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—gloriﬁed by a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts for d’ye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapor and so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many deny but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer nor inﬁdel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye chapter lxxix the tail other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i celebrate a tail reckoning the largest sized sperm whale’s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises upon its upper surface alone an area of at least ﬁfty square feet e compa round body of its root expands into two broad ﬁrm ﬂat palms or ﬂukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness at the crotch or junion these ﬂukes slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely deﬁned than in the crescentic borders of these ﬂukes at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across e entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut into it and you ﬁnd that three distin strata compose it—upper middle and lower e ﬁbres in the upper and lower layers are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers is triune struure as much as anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular ﬁbres and ﬁlaments which passing on either side the loins and running down into the ﬂukes insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the conﬂuent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it nor does this—its amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful ﬂex ion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful strength has much to do with the magic take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and its charm would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paints even god the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled hermaphroditical italian

endurance which on all hands it is con ceded form the peculiar praical virtues of his teachings such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it be in its ﬂexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace erein no fairy’s arm can transcend it five great motions are peculiar to it first when used as a ﬁn for progression second when used as a mace in battle ird in sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking ﬂukes first being horizontal in its position the leviathan’s tail as in a diﬀerent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it never wriggles in man or ﬁsh wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scrollwise coiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his sideﬁns only serve to steer by second it is a little signiﬁcant that while one sperm whale only ﬁghts another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conﬂis with man he chieﬂy and contemptuously uses his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his ﬂukes from it and the blow is only inﬂied by the recoil if it be made in the unobstrued air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply irresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whaleboat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result ese submerged side blows are so often received in the ﬁshery that they are accounted mere child’s play some one strips oﬀ a frock and the hole is stopped ird i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respe there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant’s trunk is delicacy is chieﬂy evinced in the aion of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense ﬂukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had this tail any pre hensile power i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the ﬂowermarket and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their zones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the ﬁght curved round his trunk and extraed the dart fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas you ﬁnd him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth but still you see his power in his play e broad palms of his tail are ﬂirted high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was the smoke from the touchhole fifth as in the ordinary ﬂoating posture of the leviathan the ﬂukes lie con siderably below the level of his back they are then completely out of sight be neath the surface but when he is about to plunge into the deeps his entire ﬂukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed ere in the air and so remain vi brating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breach—somewhere else to be described—this peaking of the whale’s ﬂukes is per haps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the ﬂame baltic of hell but in gazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in the dantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah the archangels standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked ﬂukes as it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld even in persia the home of the ﬁre worshippers as ptolemy philopater testiﬁed of the african elephant i then testiﬁed of the whale pronoun cing him the most devout of all beings for according to king juba the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence e chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspes of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they respeively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan so compared with leviathan’s tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily e most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous ﬂukes which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls e more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability to express it at times there are gestures in it which though they would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an extensive herd so remark able occasionally are these mystic gestures that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to freemason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant disse him how i may then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how comprehend his face when face he has none ou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face i say again he has no face ough all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respe to the whale that a dog does to the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points of curious similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream chapter lxxx the grand armada e long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending southeastward from the territories of birmah forms the most southerly point of all asia in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise conneing asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes is rampart is pierced by several sallyports for the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the straits of sunda and malacca by the straits of sunda chieﬂy vessels bound to china from the west emerge into the china seas ose narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing mid way in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold green promontory known to seamen as java head they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels and gold and ivory with which the thousand is lands of that oriental sea are enriched it seems a signiﬁcant provision of nature that such treasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineﬀeual of being guarded from the allgrasping western world e shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineer ing fortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered topsails from the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day have passed between the islands of sumatra and java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits ﬁercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears ough by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of european cruisers the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged with a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descending upon the line in the paciﬁc where ahab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit ﬁrmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it but how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land does his crew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long time now the circus running sun has raced within his ﬁery ring and needs no sustenance but what’s in himself so ahab mark this too in the whaler while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuﬀ to be transferred to foreign wharves the worldwandering whaleship carries no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants she has a whole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with utilities not altogether with unusable piglead and kentledge she carries years’ water in her clear old prime nantucket water which when three years aﬂoat the nantucketer in the paciﬁc prefers to drink before the brackish ﬂuid but yesterday rafted oﬀ in casks from the peruvian or indian streams hence it is that while other ships may have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score of ports the whaleship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but ﬂoating seamen like themselves so that did you carry them the news that another ﬂood had come they would only answer—“well boys here’s the ark” now as many sperm whales had been captured oﬀ the western coast of java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of the ground round about was generally recognised by the ﬁshermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more and more upon java head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliﬀs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with de lighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuﬀed in the air yet not a single jet was descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a speacle of singular magniﬁcence saluted us but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied aivity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the sperm whales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and proteion to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in the noonday air unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the right whale which dividing at top falls over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forward slanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward seen from the pequod’s deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapory spouts individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height as marching armies approaching an unfriendly deﬁle in the mountains accel erate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast ﬂeet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits gradually contraing the wings of their semicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneers handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number and who could tell whether in that con gregated caravan moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped whiteelephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with stunsail piled on stunsail we sailed along driving these leviathans before us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudly direing attention to something in our wake corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear it seemed formed of detached white vapors rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and go for they con stantly hovered without ﬁnally disappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivothole crying “aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails—malays sir and after us” as if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits these rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit to make up for their overcautious delay but when the swift pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit—mere ridingwhips and rowels to her that they were as with glass under arm ahab toandfro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed his and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery deﬁle in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his ven geance and beheld how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses—when all these conceits had passed through his brain ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the ﬁrm thing from its place but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so vioriously gained upon the malays but still driving on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats but no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instin of the sperm whale become notiﬁed of the three keels that were after them—though as yet a mile in their rear—than they rallied again and forming in close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked like ﬂashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the whiteash and after sev eral hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the inﬂuence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the ﬁshermen perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied e compa martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus’ elephants in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation in all direions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distraion of panic is was still more strangely evinced by those of their number who com pletely paralysed as it were helplessly ﬂoated like waterlogged dismantled ships on the sea had these leviathans been but a ﬂock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three ﬁerce wolves they could not possibly have evinced such ex cessive dismay but this occasional timidity is charaeristic of almost all herding creatures ough banding together in tens of thousands the lionmaned buﬀa loes of the west have ﬂed before a solitary horseman witness too all human beings how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit they will at the slightest alarm of ﬁre rush helter skelter for the outlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not inﬁnitely outdone by the madness of men ough many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated but colleively remained in one place as is customary in those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes’ time queequeg’s harpoon was ﬂung the stricken ﬁsh darted blinding spray in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight for the heart of the herd ough such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the ﬁshery for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspe life and only exist in a delirious throb as blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we ﬂew by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by iceisles in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed but not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheering oﬀ from this monster direly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal ﬂukes were suspended overhead while all the time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones nor were the oars men quite idle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with ey chieﬂy attended to the shouting part of the business ”out of the way commodore” cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp us ”hard down with your tail there” cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fanlike extremity all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented by the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each other’s grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chieﬂy among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can and if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is that at times like these the drugg comes into requisition our boat was furnished with three of them e ﬁrst and second were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running oﬀ fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg ey were cramped like malefaors with the chain and ball but upon ﬂinging the third in the a of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks but we stuﬀed two or three drawers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for the time it had been next to impossible to dart these druggedharpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our whale’s way greatly diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satinlike surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown oﬀ by the whale in his more quiet moods yes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion and still in the distraed distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic circusrider might easily have overarched the middle ones and so have gone round on their backs owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at present aﬀorded us we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves the women and children of this routed host now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this junure embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles at any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this circumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and conﬁdence or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at like household dogs they came snuﬄing round us right up to our gunwales and touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them queequeg patted their foreheads starbuck scratched their backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the time refrained from darting it but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended in those watery vaults ﬂoated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers e lake as i have hin ted was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will calmly and ﬁxedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two diﬀerent lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence—even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their newborn sight ﬂoating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one of these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth he was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the ﬁnal spring the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar’s bow e delicate side ﬁns and the palms of his ﬂukes still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived from foreign parts “line line” cried queequeg looking over the gunwale “him fast him fast—who line him who struck two whale one big one little” “what ails ye man” cried starbuck “looke here” said queequeg pointing down as when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he ﬂoats up again and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan amours in the deep and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and af frights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being do i myself still for ever cent rally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic speacles in the distance evinced the aivity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the ﬁrst circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were aﬀorded them but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tailtendon it is done by darting a shorthandled cuttingspade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again a whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not eﬀeually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went but agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling speacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at ﬁrst the intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the ﬁshery this whale had become entangled in the harpoonline that he towed he had also run away with the cuttingspade in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon line round his tail the cuttingspade itself had worked loose from his ﬂesh so that tormented to madness he was now churning through the water violently ﬂailing with his ﬂexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrades is terriﬁc obje seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted by half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the submarine bridalchambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contraing orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was departing a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuous masses of blockice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern “oars oars” he intensely whispered seizing the helm—“gripe your oars and clutch your souls now my god men stand by shove him oﬀ you queequeg—the whale there—prick him—hit him stand up —stand up and stay so spring men—pull men never mind their backs—scrape them—scrape away” e boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre is lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg’s hat who while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the aireddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad ﬂukes close by riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward ﬂight with augmented ﬂeetness further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed e waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the ﬂoating body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near e result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fishery—the more whales the less ﬁsh of all the drugged whales only one was captured e rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the pequod to gally or gallow is to frighten excessively—to confound with fright it is an old saxon word it oc curs once in shakespeare—e wrathful skies gallow the very wanderers of the dark and make them keep their caves to common language the word is now completely obsolete when the polite landsman ﬁrst hears it from the gaunt nan tucketer he is apt to set it down as one of the whaleman’s selfderived savageries much the same is it with many other sinewy saxonisms of this sort which emig rated to newengland rocks with the noble brawn of the old english emigrants in the time of the commonwealth us some of the best and furthestdescended english words—the etymological howards and percys—are now democratised nay plebeianised—so to speak —in the new world e sperm whale as with all other species of the leviathan but unlike most other ﬁsh breeds indiﬀerently at all seasons after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a time though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and jacob—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats curiously situated one on each side of the anus but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that when by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance the mother’s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods e milk is very sweet and rich it has been tasted by man it might do well with strawberries when overﬂowing with mutual esteem the whales salute more hominum chapter lxxxi schools and schoolmasters e previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to ﬁfty individuals each such bands are known as schools ey generally are of two sorts those composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated in cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the ﬂight of his ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly ac companied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem e contrast between this ottoman and his concubines is striking because while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more than one third of the bulk of an averagesized male ey are comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full ﬂower of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year when serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way presume to draw con ﬁdentially close to one of the ladies with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed for alas all ﬁsh bed in common as ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love ey fence with their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers not a few are captured having the deep scars of these en counters—furrowed heads broken teeth scolloped ﬁns and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the ﬁrst rush of the harem’s lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord gently he in sinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines granting other whales to be in sight the ﬁshermen will sel dom give chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unuousness is small as for the sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my lord whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardor of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reﬂeion lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent re pentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors now as the harem of whales is called by the ﬁshermen a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster it is therefore not in stri charaer however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who ﬁrst thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of vidocq and informed himself what sort of a countryschoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils e same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged sperm whales almost univer sally a lone whale—as a solitary leviathan is called—proves an ancient one like venerable mossbearded daniel boone he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody secrets e schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously men tioned oﬀer a strong contrast to the harem schools for while those female whales are charaeristically timid the young males or fortybarrelbulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous greyheaded grizzled whales sometimes met and these will ﬁght you like grim ﬁends exasperated by a penal gout e fortybarrelbull schools are larger than the harem schools like a mob of young collegians they are full of ﬁght fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard ey soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about three fourths grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlements that is harems another point of diﬀerence between the male and female schools is still more charaeristic of the sexes say you strike a fortybarrelbull —poor devil all his comrades quit him but strike a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as themselves to fall a prey chapter lxxxii fastfish and loosefish e allusion to the waifs and waifpoles in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale ﬁshery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be ﬁnally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirely comprised many minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for example—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line us the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the ﬁshermen were there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all cases perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enament was that of holland it was decreed by the statesgeneral in a d  but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law yet the american ﬁshermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter ey have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian’s pandes and the bylaws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people’s business yes these laws might be engraven on a queen anne’s farthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they i a fastfish belongs to the party fast to it ii a loosefish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it first what is a fast fish alive or dead a ﬁsh is technically fast when it is conneed with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants—a mast an oar a nineinch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same likewise a ﬁsh is technically fast when it bears a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waiﬁng it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well as their intention so to do ese are scientiﬁc commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the cokeupon littleton of the ﬁst true among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but others are by no means so scrupulous some ﬁfty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigated in eng land wherein the plaintiﬀs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the north ern seas and when indeed they the plaintiﬀs had succeeded in harpooning the ﬁsh they were at last through peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and ﬁnally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiﬀs and when those defendants were remonstrated with their captain snapped his ﬁngers in the plaintiﬀs’ teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line har poons and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the plaintiﬀs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoons and boat mr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an aion to recover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness had as last abandoned her yet abandon her he did so that she became a looseﬁsh and therefore when a subsequent gentleman reharpooned her the lady then became that subsequent gentleman’s property along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other ese pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very learned judge in set terms decided to wit—at as for the boat he awarded it to the plaintiﬀs because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoons and line they belonged to the de fendants the whale because it was a loosefish at the time of the ﬁnal capture and the harpoons and line because when the ﬁsh made oﬀ with them it the ﬁsh acquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards took the ﬁsh had a right to them now the defendants afterwards took the ﬁsh ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly obje to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case these two laws touching fastfish and loosefish i say will on reﬂeion be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines has but two props to stand on is it not a saying in every one’s mouth possession is half of the law that is re gardless of how the thing came into possession but often possession is the whole of the law what are the sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fastfish whereof possession is the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s last mite but a fastfish what is yonder undeteed vil lain’s marble mansion with a door plate for a waif what is that but a fastfish what is the ruinous discount which mordecai the broker gets from poor woebe gone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegone’s family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a fastfish what is the archbishop of savesoul’s income of lb  seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken backed laborers all sure of heaven without any of savesoul’s help what is that globular  but a fastfish what are the duke of dunder’s hereditary towns and hamlets but fastfish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fastfish what to that apostolic lancer brother jonathan is texas but a fastfish and concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law but if the dorine of fastfish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doc trine of loosefish is still more widely so at is internationally and universally applicable what was america in  but a looseﬁsh in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waiﬁng it for his royal master and mistress what was poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india to england what at last will mexico be to the united states all loosefish what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but loosefish what all men’s minds and opinions but loosefish what is the principle of religious belief in them but a loosefish what to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but loosefish what is the great globe itself but a loosefish and what are you reader but a loosefish and a fast fish too chapter lxxxiii heads or tails “de balena vero suﬃcit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam” braon l  c  latin from the books of the laws of england which taken along with the con text means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land the king as honorary grand harpooneer must have the head and the queen be respefully presented with the tail a division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder now as this law under a modiﬁed form is to this day in force in england and as it oﬀers in various re spes a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loosefish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the ﬁrst place in curious proof of the fa that the above mentioned law is still in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years it seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a ﬁne whale which they had originally descried afar oﬀ from the shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiion of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden holding the oﬃce direly from the crown i believe all the royal emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment his by some writers this oﬃce is called a sinecure but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites which are his chieﬂy by virtue of that same fobbing of them now when these poor sunburnt mariners bare footed and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled their fat ﬁsh high and dry promising themselves a good  pounds from the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of their respeive shares up steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whale’s head he says—“hands oﬀ this ﬁsh my masters is a fastfish i seize it as the lord warden’s” upon this the poor mariners in their respe ful consternation—so truly english—knowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for his ideas made bold to speak “please sir who is the lord warden” “e duke” “but the duke had nothing to do with taking this ﬁsh” “it is his” “we have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is all that to go to the duke’s beneﬁt we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters” “it is his” “is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood” “it is his” “i thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share of this whale” “it is his” “won’t the duke be content with a quarter or a half” “it is his” in a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke of wellington received the money inking that viewed in some particular lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respefully addressed a note to his grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to which my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published that he had already done so and received the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other people’s business is this the still militant old man standing at the corners of the three kingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right e law itself has already been set forth but plowdon gives us the reason for it says plow don the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen “because of its superior excellence” and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason for that ye lawyers in his treatise on “queengold” or queenpinmoney an old king’s bench au thor one william prynne thus discourseth “ye tail is ye queen’s that ye queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone” now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices but this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here ere are two royal ﬁsh so styled by the english law writers—the whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that ﬁsh which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there seems a reason in all things even in law chapter lxxxiv the pequod meets the rosebud “in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan insuﬀerable fetor denying not inquiry” sir t browne v e it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory midday sea that the many noses on the pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea “i will bet something now” said stubb “that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they would keel up before long“ presently the vapors in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colors from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the ﬁshermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so ﬂoated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fa that the oil obtained from such subjes is of a very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of attarofrose coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the ﬁrst in truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defun bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing ﬁsherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted whales in general e pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he re cognized his cutting spadepole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales “ere’s a pretty fellow now“ he banteringly laughed standing in the ship’s bows “there’s a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the ﬁshery sometimes lowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuﬀers foreseeing that all the oil they will get won’t be enough to dip the captain’s wick into aye we all know these things but look ye here’s a crappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious ﬁsh he has there poor devil i say pass round a hat some one and let’s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity’s sake for what oil he’ll get from that drugged whale there wouldn’t be ﬁt to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why i’ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than he’ll get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now if our old man has thought of that it’s worth trying yes i’m for it” and so saying he started for the quarterdeck by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boat’s crew and pulled oﬀ for the stranger drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projeing from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read “bouton de rose” —rosebutton or rosebud and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship ough stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet the word rose and the bulbous ﬁgurehead put together suﬃciently explained the whole to him “a wooden rosebud eh“ he cried with his hand to his nose “that will do very well but how like all creation it smells” now in order to hold dire communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale and so talk over it arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawled—“bouton derose ahoy are there any of you boutonderoses that speak english” “yes” rejoined a guernseyman from the bulwarks who turned out to be the chiefmate “well then my boutonderose bud have you seen the white whale” “what whale” “e white whale—a sperm whale—moby dick have ye seen him” “never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whale—no” “very good then good bye now and i’ll call again in a minute” en rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning over the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted—“no sir no“ upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman he now perceived that the guernseyman who had just got into the chains and was using a cuttingspade had slung his nose in a sort of bag “what’s the matter with your nose there” said stubb “broke it” “i wish it was broken or that i didn’t have any nose at all” answered the guernseyman who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much “but what are you holding yours for” “oh nothing it’s a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day aint it air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye boutonderose” “what in the devil’s name do you want here” roared the guernseyman ﬂying into a sudden passion “oh keep cool—cool yes that’s the word why don’t you pack those whales in ice while you’re working at ’em but joking aside though do you know rose bud that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales as for that dried up one there he hasn’t a gill in his whole carcase” “i know that well enough but d’ye see the captain here won’t believe it this is his ﬁrst voyage he was a cologne manufaurer before but come aboard and mayhap he’ll believe you if he won’t me and so i’ll get out of this dirty scrape” “anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow” rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck ere a queer scene presented itself e sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their noses upwardly projeed from their faces like so many jib booms now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the masthead to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coaltar and at intervals held it to their nostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short oﬀ at the bowl were vigorously puﬃng tobaccosmoke so that it constantly ﬁlled their olfaories stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain’s roundhouse abaft and looking in that direion saw a ﬁery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within is was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself to the captain’s roundhouse cabinet he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the guernsey man had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unproﬁtable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb fur ther perceived that the guernseyman had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and conﬁdential with him so that the two quickly concoed a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of dis trusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernseyman under cover of an interpreter’s oﬃce was to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview by this time their destined viim appeared from his cabin he was a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptain with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watchseals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely introduced by the guernseyman who at once ostentatiously put on the aspe of interpreting between them “what shall i say to him ﬁrst” said he “why” said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals “you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me though i don’t pretend to be a judge” “he says monsieur” said the guernseyman in french turning to his cap tain “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside” upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more “what now” said the guernseyman to stubb “why since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him carefully i’m quite certain that he’s no more ﬁt to command a whaleship than a st jago monkey in fa tell him from me he’s a baboon” “he vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in ﬁne monsieur he conjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these ﬁsh” instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once cast loose the cables and chains conﬁning the whales to the ship “what now” said the guernseyman when the captain had returned to them “why let me see yes you may as well tell him now that—that—in fa tell him i’ve diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody else” “he says monsieur that he’s very happy to have been of any service to us” hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux “he wants you to take a glass of wine with him” said the interpreter “ank him heartily but tell him it’s against my principles to drink with the man i’ve diddled in fa tell him i must go” “he says monsieur that his principles won’t admit of his drinking but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for it’s so calm they won’t drift” by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the guernseyman to this eﬀe—that having a long towline in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship’s side while the frenchman’s boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long towline presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast oﬀ from the whale hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while the pequod slid in between him and stubb’s whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the ﬂoating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boatspade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side ﬁn you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boat’s crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as goldhunters and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and ﬁghting around them stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which ﬂowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will ﬂow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time “i have it i have it” cried stubb with delight striking something in the sub terranean regions “a purse a purse” dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of some thing that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash color and this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoid ably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab’s loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye chapter lxxxv ambergris now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in  a certain nantucketborn captain coﬃn was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subje for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned ough the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distin for amber though at times found on the seacoast is also dug up in some far inland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouth pieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hairpowders and pomatum e turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peter’s in rome some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to ﬂavor it who would think then that such ﬁne ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the eﬀe of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat loads of brandreth’s pills and then running out of harm’s way as laborers do in blasting rocks i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plates which at ﬁrst stubb thought might be sailors’ trousers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fa that of all things of ill savor colognewater in its rudimental manufauring stages is the worst i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot ow ing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be considered as indirely substantiated by what has been said of the frenchman’s two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut ey hint that all whales always smell bad now how did this odious stigma originate i opine that it is plainly traceable to the ﬁrst arrival of the greenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any other course e consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave yard for the foundations of a lying in hospital i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former times of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great work on smells a textbook on that subje as its name imports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to aﬀord a place for the blubber of the dutch whale ﬂeet to be tried out without being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a colleion of furnaces fatkettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is quite diﬀerent from a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps after completely ﬁlling her hold with oil does not perhaps consume ﬁfty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless e truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the people of the middle ages aﬀeed to dete a jew in the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm whale’s ﬂukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a musk scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great chapter lxxxvi the castaway it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a most signiﬁcant event befell the most insigniﬁcant of the pequod’s crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats’ crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a shipkeeper it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nickname pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomy jolly in outer aspe pip and doughboy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar color driven in one ec centric span but while hapless doughboy was by nature dull and torpid in his intelles pip though over tenderhearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with ﬁner freer relish than any other race for blacks the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixtyﬁve fourth of julys and new year’s days nor smile so while i write that this little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in king’s cabinets but pip loved life and all life’s peaceable securities so that the panicstriking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become en trapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild ﬁres that ﬁitiously showed him oﬀ to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in conneicut he had once enlivened many a ﬁddler’s frolic on the green and at melodious eventide with his gay haha had turned the round horizon into one starbelled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blueveined neck the pure watered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases en come out those ﬁery eﬀulgences infernally superb then the evilblazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crown jewel stolen from the king of hell but let us to the story it came to pass that in the ambergris aﬀair stubb’s afteroarsman chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily pip was put into his place e ﬁrst time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close conta with the whale and therefore came oﬀ not altogether discreditably though stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often ﬁnd it needful now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the ﬁsh received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pip’s seat e involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water at instant the stricken whale started on a ﬁerce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest and neck tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the ﬁre of the hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boatknife from its sheath he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively “cut“ meantime pip’s blue choked face plainly looked do for god’s sake all passed in a ﬂash in less than half a minute this entire thing happened “damn him cut“ roared stubb and so the whale was lost and pip was saved so soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain businesslike but still half humorous manner cursed pip oﬃcially and that done unoﬃcially gave him much wholesome advice e substance was never jump from a boat pip except—but all the rest was indeﬁnite as the soundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is your true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command “stick to the boat pip or by the lord i wont pick you up if you jump mind that we can’t aﬀord to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and don’t jump any more“ hereby perhaps stubb indirely hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a moneymaking animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was under very similar circumstances to the ﬁrst performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried traveller’s trunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and ﬂatly stretching away all round to the horizon like goldbeater’s skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pip’s ebon head showed like a head of cloves no boatknife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern stubb’s in exorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the praised swimmer as to ride in a spring carriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable e intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not unfrequently occur almost invariably in the ﬁshery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and stubb’s boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his ﬁsh that pip’s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the ship it self at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was e sea had jeeringly kept his ﬁnite body up but drowned the inﬁnite of his soul not drowned entirely though rather car ried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the misermerman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless everjuvenile etern ities pip saw the multitudinous godomnipresent coral inses that out of the ﬁrmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs he saw god’s foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so man’s insanity is heaven’s sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indiﬀerent as his god for the rest blame not stubb too hardly e thing is common in that ﬁshery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself chapter lxxxvii a squeeze of the hand at whale of stubb’s so dearly purchased was duly brought to the pequod’s side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in drag ging away the larger tubs so soon as ﬁlled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the tryworks of which anon it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large constantine’s bath of it i found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into ﬂuid a sweet and unuous duty no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favorite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molliﬁer after having my hands in it for only a few minutes my ﬁngers felt like eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralize as i sat there at my ease crosslegged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my hands among those soft gentle globules of in ﬁltrated tissues woven almost within the hour as they richly broke to my ﬁngers and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuﬀed up that uncontaminated aroma—literally and truly like the smell of spring violets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all illwill or petulence or malice of any sort whatsoever squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my colaborers’ hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules such an abounding aﬀeion ate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to say—oh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish any social acerbit ies or know the slightest illhumor or envy come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intelle or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the ﬁreside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i saw long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the tryworks first comes whitehorse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the ﬁsh and also from the thicker portions of his ﬂukes it is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some oil after being severed from the whale the whitehorse is ﬁrst cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer ey look much like blocks of berkshire marble plumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale’s ﬂesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often par ticipating to a considerable degree in its unuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful obje to behold as its name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple it is plums of rubies in piures of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the ﬁrst day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually ﬁne vintage of the vineyards of champagne ere is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to de scribe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance it is an ineﬀably oozy stringy aﬀair most fre quently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case coalescing gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but some times incidentally used by the sperm ﬁshermen it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped oﬀ the back of the greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan nippers strily this word is not indigenous to the whale’s vocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whaleman’s nipper is a short ﬁrm strip of tendinous stuﬀ cut from the tapering part of leviathan’s tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with its inmates is place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen ey generally go in pairs —a pikeandgaﬀman and a spademan e whalingpike is similar to a frigate’s boardingweapon of the same name e gaﬀ is something like a boathook with his gaﬀ the gaﬀman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spademan stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horsepieces is spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademan’s feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cuts oﬀ one of his own toes or one of his assistants’ would you be very much astonished toes are scarce among veteran blubberroom men chapter lxxxviii the cassock had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain junure of this postmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical obje which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous cistern in the whale’s huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone— longer than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jetblack as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as that found in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the th chapter of the ﬁrst book of kings look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoulders staggers oﬀ with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the ﬁeld extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt as an african hunter the pelt of a boa is done he turns the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for armholes at the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it e mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately prote him while employed in the peculiar funions of his oﬃce at oﬃce consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for the pots an op eration which is condued at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orator’s desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishop rick what a lad for a pope were this mincer bible leaves bible leaves is is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality chapter lxxxix the tryworks besides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her tryworks she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship it is as if from the open ﬁeld a brickkiln were transported to her planks e tryworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck e timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength ﬁtted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten feet by eight square and ﬁve in height e foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is ﬁrmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bra cing it on all sides and screwing it down to the timbers on the ﬂanks it is cased with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great trypots two in number and each of several barrels’ capacity when not in use they are kept remarkably clean some times they are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punchbowls during the nightwatches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing them—one man in each pot side by side—many conﬁdential communications are carried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation it was in the left hand trypot of the pequod with the soapstone dili gently circling round me that i was ﬁrst indirely struck by the remarkable fa that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point in precisely the same time removing the ﬁreboard from the front of the tryworks the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces direly underneath the pots ese mouths are ﬁtted with heavy doors of iron e intense heat of the ﬁre is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates ere are no external chimneys they open dire from the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment it was about nine o’clock at night that the pequod’s try works were ﬁrst started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee the business “all ready there oﬀ hatch then and start her you cook ﬁre the works” is was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that in a whaling voyage the ﬁrst ﬁre in the tryworks has to be fed for a time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains consid erable of its unuous properties ese fritters feed the ﬂames like a plethoric burning martyr or a selfconsuming misanthrope once ignited the whale sup plies his own fuel and burns by his own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells like the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit by midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean darkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the ﬁerce ﬂames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty ﬂues and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek ﬁre e burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphur freighted brigs of the bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of ﬂame for sails bore down upon the turkish frigates and folded them in conﬂagrations e hatch removed from the top of the works now aﬀorded a wide hearth in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the pagan har pooneers always the whaleship’s stokers with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or stirred up the ﬁres beneath till the snaky ﬂames darted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet e smoke rolled away in sullen heaps to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces opposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass is served for a seasofa here lounged the watch when not other wise employed looking into the red heat of the ﬁre till their eyes felt scorched in their heads eir tawny features now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works as they narrated to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the ﬂames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and fur ther into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing pequod freighted with savages and laden with ﬁre and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s soul so seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hours silently guided the way of this ﬁre ship on the sea wrapped for that interval in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others e con tinual sight of the ﬁend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in ﬁre these at last begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing oc curred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong e jawbone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes were open i was half conscious of putting my ﬁngers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart but spite of all this i could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by ﬂashes of red ness uppermost was the impression that whatever swift rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern a stark bewildered feeling as of death came over me convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in my brief sleep i had turned myself about and was fronting the ship’s stern with my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from ﬂying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee look not too long in the face of the ﬁre o man never dream with thy hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the ﬁrst hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artiﬁcial ﬁre when its redness makes all things look ghastly tomorrow in the natural sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking ﬂames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lamp—all others but liars nevertheless the sun hides not virginia’s dismal swamp nor rome’s accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon e sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him that mortal man cannot be true—not true or undeveloped with books the same e truest of all men was the man of sorrows and the truest of all books is solomon’s and ecclesiastes is the ﬁne hammered steel of woe “all is vanity” a is wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian solomon’s wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals and jails and walks fast cross ing grave yards and would rather talk of operas than hell calls cowper young pascal rousseau poor devils all of sick men and throughout a carefree lifetime swears by rabelais as passing wise and therefore jolly—not that man is ﬁtted to sit down on tombstones and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon but even solomon he says “the man that wandereth out of the way of under standing shall remain” ie even while living “in the congregation of the dead” give not thyself up then to ﬁre lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me ere is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces and even if he for ever ﬂies within the gorge that gorge is in the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar chapter xc the lamp had you descended from the pequod’s tryworks to the pequod’s forecastle where the oﬀ duty watch were sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors ere they lay in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chis elled muteness a score of lamps ﬂashing upon his hooded eyes in merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth an aladdin’s lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ship’s black hull still houses an illumination see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps—often but old bottles and vials though—to the copper cooler at the tryworks and re plenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat he burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufaured and therefore unvitiated state a ﬂuid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivances ashore it is sweet as early grass butter in april he goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game chapter xci stowing down and clearing up already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar oﬀ descried from the masthead how he is chased over the watery moors and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towed alongside and beheaded and how on the prin ciple which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach and abed nego his spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through the ﬁre—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehears ing—singing if i may—the romantic proceeding of decanting oﬀ his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface as before but alas never more to rise and blow while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the sixbarrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the mid night sea the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last manhandled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now ex oﬃcio every sailor is a cooper at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their ﬁnal rest in the sea is done the hatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up in the sperm ﬁshery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling one day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarterdeck enormous masses of the whale’s head are pro fanely piled great rusty casks lie about as in a brewery yard the smoke from the tryworks has besooted all the bulwarks the mariners go about suﬀused with unc tuousness the entire ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hands the din is deafening but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this selfsame ship and were it not for the telltale boats and tryworks you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander e unmanufaured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue is is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an aﬀair of oil besides from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent ley is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains cling ing to the side that ley quickly exterminates it hands go diligently along the bulwarks and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness e soot is brushed from the lower rigging all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away e great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the tryworks completely hiding the pots every cask is out of sight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship’s company the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions shift themselves from top to toe and ﬁnally issue to the immacu late deck fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms newleaped from out the daintiest holland now with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and humor ously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and ﬁne cambrics propose to mat the deck think of having hangings to the top obje not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little short of audacity ey know not the thing you distantly allude to away and bring us napkins but mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small greasespot somewhere yes and many is the time when after the severest uninterrupted labors which know no night continuing straight through for ninetysix hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the line—they only step to the deck to carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined ﬁres of the equatorial sun and the equatorial tryworks when on the heel of all this they have ﬁnally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by the cry of “ere she blows” and away they ﬂy to ﬁght another whale and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friends but this is mankilling yet this is life for hardly have we mortals by long toilings extraed from the world’s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its deﬁlements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul hardly is this done when—ere she blows—the ghost is spouted up and away we sail to ﬁght some other world and go through young life’s old routine again oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two thou sand years ago did die so good so wise so mild i sailed with thee along the peruvian coast last voyage—and foolish as i am taught thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope chapter xcii the doubloon ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarterdeck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular obje before him when he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the same aspe of nailed ﬁrmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness but one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly attrac ted by the strange ﬁgures and inscriptions stamped on it as though now for the ﬁrst time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever signiﬁcance might lurk in them and some certain signiﬁcance lurks in all things else all things are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about boston to ﬁll up some morass in the milky way now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the headwaters of many a paolus ﬂows and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it was set apart and saniﬁed to one awestriking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whale’s talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun and tropic tokenpieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes sun’s disks and stars ecliptics hornsofplenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so spanishly poetic it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy example of these things on its round border it bore the letters r  e  so this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three andes’ summits from one a ﬂame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoial point at libra before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing “ere’s something ever egotistical in mountaintops and towers and all other grand and lofty things look here—three peaks as proud as lucifer e ﬁrm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and viorious fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magician’s glass to each and

here that she hailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of enderby and sons a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord  this great whaling house was in existence my numerous ﬁshdocuments do not make plain but in that year  it ﬁtted out the ﬁrst english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of years previous ever since  our valiant coﬃns and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large ﬂeets pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere be it distinly recorded here that the nan tucketers were the ﬁrst among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him in  a ﬁne ship the amelia ﬁtted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape horn and was the ﬁrst among the nations to lower a whale boat of any sort in the great south sea e voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the amelia’s example was soon followed by other ships english and american and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the paciﬁc were thrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his sons—how many their mother only knows—and under their immediate auspices and partly i think at their expense the british government was induced to send the sloopofwar rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded by a naval post captain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear but this is not all in  the same house ﬁtted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan at ship—well called the ”syren“—made a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground ﬁrst became generally known e syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coﬃn a nantucketer all honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world e ship named after him was worthy of the honor being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhere oﬀ the patagonian coast and drank good ﬂip down in the forecastle it was a ﬁne gam we had and they were all trumps—every soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that ﬁne gam i had —long very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel—it minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever lose sight of it flip did i say we had ﬂip yes and we ﬂipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for it’s squally oﬀ there by patagonia and all hands—visitors and all—were called to reef topsails we were so topheavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts did not go overboard and by and bye we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the ﬂip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste e beef was ﬁne—tough but with body in it ey said it was bullbeef oth ers that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestru ible dumplings i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out of you like billiardballs e bread—but that couldn’t be helped besides it was an antiscorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensions of the cook’s boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty ﬁne ﬂip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to hat band but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english whalers i know of—not all though—were such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i will tell you e abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed e english were preceded in the whale ﬁshery by the hollanders zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant in the ﬁshery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english merchantship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated during my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew must be about whalers e title was ”dan coopman“ wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the ﬁshery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the produion of one “fitz swackhammer“ but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st pott’s to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble— this same dr snodhead so soon as he spied the book assured me that “dan coopman” did not mean “e cooper” but “e merchant” in short this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjes contained a very interesting account of its whale ﬁshery and in this chapter it was headed “smeer” or “fat” that i found a long detailed list of the outﬁts for the larders and cellars of  sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following  lbs of beef  lbs friesland pork  lbs of stock ﬁsh  lbs of biscuit  lbs of soft bread  ﬁrkins of butter  lbs of texel and leyden cheese  lbs cheese probably an inferior article  ankers of geneva  barrels of beer most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is ﬂooded with whole pipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were incidentally sugges ted to me capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my own touching the probable quantity of stockﬁsh c consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient green land and spitzbergen whale ﬁshery in the ﬁrst place the amount of butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their naturally unuous natures being rendered still more unuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil e quantity of beer too is very large  barrels now as those polar ﬁsheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three months say and reckoning  men to each of their ﬂeet of  sail we have  low dutch seamen in all therefore i say we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks’ allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that  ankers of gin now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat’s head and take good aim at ﬂying whales this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern ﬁshery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the masthead and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford but no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the english whalers have not negleed so excellent an example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the decanter chapter xciv a bower in the arsacides hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chieﬂy dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspe or separately and in detail upon some few interior struural features but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behoves me now to unbutton him still further and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the ﬁshery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver leures on the anatomy of the ceta cea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a fullgrown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a roastpig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridgepole sleepers and under pinnings making up the framework of leviathan and belike of the tallowvats dairyrooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed with an opportunity to disse him in miniature in a ship i belonged to a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances ink you i let that chance go without using my boat hatchet and jackknife and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub and as for my exa knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at tranque years ago when attached to the tradingship dey of algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a seaside glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo town his capital among many other ﬁne qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent chieﬂy carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonder freighted tribute rendering waves had cast upon his shores chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoa nut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it e ribs were hung with trophies the vertebrae were carved with arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic ﬂame so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout while suspended from a bough the terriﬁc lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hairhung sword that so aﬀrighted damocles it was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the living ﬂowers the ﬁgures all the trees with all their laden branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the message carrying air all these unceasingly were aive rough the lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a ﬂying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaver—pause—one word —whither ﬂows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings speak weaver—stay thy hand—but one single word with thee nay—the shuttle ﬂies—the ﬁgures ﬂoat from forth the loom the freshet rushing carpet for ever slides away e weaver god he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it for even so it is in all material faories e spoken words that are inaudible among the ﬂying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements ereby have villanies been deteed ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great world’s loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar now amid the green liferestless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler yet as the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vines every month as suming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curlyheaded glories now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artiﬁcial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an obje of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genu ine to and fro i paced before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs —and with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many winding shaded collonades and arbors but soon my line was out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones cutting me a green measuringrod i once more dived within the skeleton from their arrowslit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the ﬁnal rib “how now” they shouted “dar’st thou measure this our god at’s for us” “aye priests—well how long do ye make him then” but hereupon a ﬁerce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked each other’s sconces with their yardsticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements ese admeasurements i now propose to set before you but ﬁrst be it re corded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to to test my accur acy ere is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where they have some ﬁne specimens of ﬁnbacks and other whales likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have what the proprietors call “the only perfe specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states” moreover at a place in york shire england burton constable by name a certain sir cliﬀord constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friend king tranquo’s in both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds king tranquo seiz ing his because he wanted it and sir cliﬀord because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir cliﬀord’s whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon his lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trapdoors and shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side sir cliﬀord thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead e skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild wanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composing—at least what untattooed parts might remain—i did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale chapter xcv measurement of the whale’s skeleton in the ﬁrst place i wish to lay before you a particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are brieﬂy to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here according to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base upon captain scoresby’s estimate of seventy tons for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful calculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between eightyﬁve and ninety feet in length and some thing less than forty feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would consider ably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants ink you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put to this le viathan to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination having already in various ways put before you his skull spouthole jaw teeth tail forehead ﬁns and divers other parts i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstrued bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general struure we are about to view in length the sperm whale’s skeleton at tranque measured seventytwo feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one ﬁfth in length compared with the living body of this seventy two feet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some ﬁfty feet of plain backbone attached to this backbone for something less than a third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals to me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new laid upon the stocks when only some twenty of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconneed timber e ribs were ten on a side e ﬁrst to begin from the neck was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each successively longer till you came to the climax of the ﬁfth or one of the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches from that part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only spanned ﬁve feet and some inches in general thickness they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length e middle ribs were the most arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams in considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with the circum stance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form e largest of the tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the ﬁsh which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the liv ing magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in ﬂesh muscle blood and bowels still more for the ample ﬁns i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless ﬂukes an utter blank how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenu ated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his angry ﬂukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out but the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile its bones high up on end no speedy enterprise but now it’s done it looks much like pompey’s pillar ere are forty and odd vertebrae in all which in the skeleton are not locked together ey mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry e largest a middle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth more than four e smallest where the spine tapers away into the tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white billiardball i was told that there were still smaller ones but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priest’s children who had stolen them to play marbles with us we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers oﬀ at last into simple child’s play chapter xcvi the fossil whale from his mighty bulk the whale aﬀords a most congenial theme whereon to en large amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not compress him by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hausers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeck of a lineof battleship since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behoves me to ap prove myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described him in most of his present habitatory and ana tomical peculiarities it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological fos siliferous and antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the leviathan—to an ant or a ﬂea—such portly terms might justly be deemed unwar rantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the diionary and here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographer’s uncom mon personal bulk more ﬁtted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subje though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals give me a condor’s quill give me vesuvius’ crater for an inkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere a of penning my thoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and mastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its suburbs such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the ﬂea though many there be who have tried it ere entering upon the subje of fossil whales i present my credentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise by way of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extin the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the tertiary formations seem the conneing or at any rate intercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last preceding the superﬁcial formations and though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet suﬃciently akin to them in general respes to justify their taking ranks as cetacean fossils detached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of their bones and skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year  was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost direly upon the palace of the tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleon’s time cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extin monster found in the year  on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama e awestricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels e alabama doors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species a signiﬁcant illustration of the fa again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks jaws ribs and vertebrae all charaerized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of seamonsters but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar aﬃnities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a ﬂood borne back to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man here saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me and i obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and in all the  miles of this world’s circumference not an inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was visible en the whole world was the whale’s and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh’s methuselah seems a schoolboy i look round to shake hands with shem i am horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over but not alone has this leviathan left his preadamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous charaer we ﬁnd the unmistakable print of his ﬁn in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some ﬁfty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griﬃns and dolphins similar to the grotesque ﬁgures on the celestial globe of the moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was there swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set down by the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller “not far from the seaside they have a temple the rafters and beams of which are made of whalebones for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore e common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pass it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea and wound the whales when they light upon ’em ey keep a whale’s rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot be reached by a man upon a camel’s back is rib says john leo is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it eir historians aﬃrm that a prophet who prophesy’d of mahomet came from this temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple” in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be a nan tucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there chapter xcvii does the whale’s magnitude diminish—will he perish inasmuch then as this leviathan comes ﬂoundering down upon us from the headwaters of the eternities it may be ﬁtly inquired whether in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires but upon investigation we ﬁnd that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system embracing a distin geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones of all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen that the tapemeasure gives seventy two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemen’s authority that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture but may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it not be that since adam’s time they have degenerated assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of such gentle men as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length—rope walks and ames tunnels of whales and even in the days of banks and solander cooke’s naturalists we ﬁnd a danish member of the academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydansiskur or wrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet and lacepede the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page  sets down the right whale at one hun dred metres three hundred and twentyeight feet and this work was published so late as a d  but will any whaleman believe these stories no e whale of today is as big as his ancestors in pliny’s time and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so because i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born do not measure so much in their coﬃns as a modern kentuckian in his socks and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they are drawn just as plainly prove that the highbred stallfed prize cattle of smithﬁeld not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaoh’s fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient lookouts at the mast heads of the whaleships now penetrating even through behring’s straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts the moot point is whether le viathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the ﬁnal puﬀ comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buﬀalo which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populous river capitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinc tion but you must look at this matter in every light ough so short a period ago—not a good lifetime —the census of the buﬀalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far diﬀerent nature of the whalehunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whale for fortyeight months think they have done extremely well and thank god if at last they carry home the oil of forty ﬁsh whereas in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west when the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of months mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slain not forty but forty thousand and more buﬀaloes a fa that if need were could be statistically stated nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favor of the gradual ex tinion of the sperm whale for example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales inﬂuenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfre quent armies at is all and equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the socalled whalebone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also is declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar speacle furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two ﬁrm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss have retreated to their moun tains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whalebone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy ﬁelds and ﬂoes and in a charmed circle of everlasting december bid deﬁance to all pursuit from man but as perhaps ﬁfty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions but though for some time past a number of these whales not less than  have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the americans alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to harto the historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam took  elephants that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the successive monarchs of the east—if they still survive there in great numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the isles of the sea combined moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distin adult generations must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children who were alive seventyﬁve years ago and adding this count less host to the present human population of the globe wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his species however perishable in his individuality he swam the seas before the continents broke water he once swam over the site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noah’s ﬂood he despised noah’s ark and if ever the world is to be again ﬂooded like the netherlands to kill oﬀ its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial ﬂood spout his frothed deﬁance to the skies chapter xcviii ahab’s leg e precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel en derby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a halfsplintering shock and when after gaining his own deck and his own pivothole there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it was as ever something about his not steering in ﬂexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearances lusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not been very long prior to the pequod’s sailing from nantucket that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stakewise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme diﬃculty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suﬀering was but the dire issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable events do naturally beget their like yea more than equally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by the joychildlessness of all hell’s despair whereas some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic signiﬁcance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracingsout not belie the obvious deduion to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad haymaking suns and softcymballing round harvest moons we must needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad e ineﬀaceable sad birthmark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more prop erly in set way have been disclosed before with many other particulars concern ing ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such grandlamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the dead captain peleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed as touching all ahab’s deeper part every revelation partook more of signiﬁcant dark ness than of explanatory light but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least at direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness and not only this but to that evercontraing dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—remaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by ahab—invested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land of spir its and of wails so that through their zeal for him they had all conspired so far as in them lay to muﬄe up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it was that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequod’s decks but be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindiive princes and potentates of ﬁre have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain praical procedures—he called the carpenter and when that funionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and direed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory sperm whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful seleion of the stoutest clearestgrained stuﬀ might be secured is done the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night and to provide all the ﬁttings for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ship’s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the aﬀair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed chapter xcix the carpenter seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and take high abstraed man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraion the pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate hence he now comes in person on this stage like all seagoing ship carpenters and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels he was to a certain oﬀhanded praical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly ef ﬁcient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years’ voyage in uncivilized and far distant seas for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties—repairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape of clumsybladed oars inserting bull’s eyes in the deck or new treenails in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more direly pertaining to his special business he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conﬂiing aptitudes both useful and capricious e one grand stage where he enaed all his various parts so manifold was his vicebench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices of diﬀerent sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times except when whales were along side this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the tryworks a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole

concluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth us this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indiﬀerent and without respe in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he deemed but topblocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans but while now upon so wide a ﬁeld thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain imper sonal stolidity as it were impersonal i say for it so shaded oﬀ into the surround ing inﬁnite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly aive in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you though you dig foundations for cathed rals yet was this halfhorrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an allramifying heartlessness—yet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutch like antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah’s ark was it that this old car penter had been a lifelong wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed oﬀ whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him he was a stript abstra an unfraioned integral uncompromised as a newborn babe living without pre meditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instin or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his ﬁngers he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheﬃeld contrivances assuming the ex terior—though a little swelled —of a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screwdrivers corkscrews tweezers awls pens rulers nailﬁlers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the car penter for a screwdriver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the legs and there they were yet as previously hinted this omnitooled openandshut carpenter was after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same unaccountable cunning lifeprinciple in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentrybox and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake chapter c ahab and the

were pumping the ship next morning and lo no incon siderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak much concern was shown and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavorable aﬀair now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the china waters into the paciﬁc and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the japanese islands— niphon matsmai and sikoke with his snowwhite new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruninghook of a jackknife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again “who’s there” hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round to it “on deck begone” “captain ahab mistakes it is i e oil in the hold is leaking sir we must up burtons and break out” “up burtons and break out now that we are nearing japan heaveto here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops” “either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving sir” “so it is so it is if we get it” “i was speaking of the oil in the hold sir” “and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak i’m all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and that’s a far worse plight than the pequod’s man yet i don’t stop to plug my leak for who can ﬁnd it in the deeploaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this life’s howling gale starbuck i’ll not have the burtons hoisted” “what will the owners say sir” “let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what cares ahab owners owners ou art always prating to me starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye my conscience is in this ship’s keel—on deck” “captain ahab” said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respeful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself “a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab” “devils dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me—on deck” “nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sir—to be forbearing shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab” ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most south seamen’s cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck exclaimed “ere is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is lord over the pequod—on deck” for an instant in the ﬂashing eyes of the mate and his ﬁery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said “ou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man” “he waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that” mur mured ahab as starbuck disappeared “what’s that he said—ahab beware of ahab—there’s something there” en unconsciously using the musket for a staﬀ with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck “ou art but too good a fellow starbuck” he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew “furl the t’gallantsails and closereef the topsails fore and aft back the mainyard up burtons and break out in the main hold” it were perhaps vain to surmise exaly why it was that as respeing starbuck ahab thus aed it may have been a ﬂash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaﬀeion however transient in the important chief oﬃcer of his ship however it was his orders were executed and the burtons were hoisted in sperm whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semi weekly duty to condu a hose into the hold and drench the casks with seawater which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ship’s pumps hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed charaer of the withdrawn water the mariners readily dete any serious leakage in the precious cargo chapter cii queequeg in his coffin upon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfely sound and that the leak must be further oﬀ so it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumbers of the huge groundtier butts and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above so deep did they go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspe of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy cornerstone cask containing coins of captain noah with copies of the posted placards vainly warning the infatuated old world from the ﬂood tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an airfreighted demijohn topheavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head well was it that the typhoons did not visit them then now at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fast bosom friend queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him nigh to his endless end be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who as harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale but—as we have elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea and ﬁnally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous conﬁnement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so called poor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well and a well or an icehouse it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some days’ suﬀering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few longlingering days till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing but as all else in him thinned and his cheekbones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and the drawing near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell so that—let us say it again—no dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his ﬁnal rest and the ocean’s invisible ﬂoodtide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favor he asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the rich warwood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be ﬂoated away to the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the stars are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own mild uncontinented seas interﬂow with the blue heavens and so form the white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual seacustom tossed like something vile to the death devouring sharks no he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coﬃncanoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much leeway adown the dim ages now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do queequeg’s bidding whatever it might include ere was some heathenish coﬃncolored old lumber aboard which upon a long pre vious voyage had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coﬃn was recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indiﬀerent promptitude of his charaer proceeded into the forecastle and took queequeg’s measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequeg’s person as he shifted the rule “ah poor fellow he’ll have to die now” ejaculated the long island sailor going to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience’ sake and general ref erence now transferringly measured on it the exa length the coﬃn was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities is done he marshalled the planks and his tools and to work when the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and ﬁtted he lightly shouldered the coﬃn and went forward with it inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direion overhearing the indignant but half humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coﬃn away queequeg to every one’s consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to be indulged leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coﬃn with an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coﬃn along with one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a ﬂask of fresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up for a pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his ﬁnal bed that he might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay without moving a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god yojo en crossing his arms on his breast with yojo between he called for the coﬃn lid hatch he called it to be placed over him e head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg in his coﬃn with little but his composed countenance in view rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammock but ere this was done pip who had been slily hovering near by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings took him by the hand in the other holding his tambourine “poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where go ye now but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beaches are only beat with waterlilies will

behind—i found it rigadig dig dig now queequeg die and i’ll beat ye your dying march” “i have heard” murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle “that in violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues and that when the mys tery is probed it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars so to my fond faith poor pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes where learned he that but there—hark he speaks again but more wildly now” “from two and two let’s make a general of him ho where’s his harpoon lay it across here—rigadig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dies game—mind ye that queequeg

cowards—shame upon them let ’em go drown like pip that jumped from a whaleboat shame shame” during all this queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream pip was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coﬃn was proved a good ﬁt queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenter’s box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this—at a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred ey asked him then whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word it was queequeg’s conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort now there is this noteworthy diﬀerence between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwell again in a day so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself ﬁt for a ﬁght with a wild whimsiness he now used his coﬃn for a sea chest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque ﬁgures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequeg —“oh devilish tantalization of the gods” chapter ciii the pacific when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last

the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the ﬁre began hammering it upon the anvil—the red mass sending oﬀ the sparks in thick hovering ﬂights some of which ﬂew close to ahab “are these thy mother carey’s chickens perth they are always ﬂying in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to all—look here they burn but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch”

the last one work that over again perth” is done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron as then with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil perth passing to him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight ﬂame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towards the ﬁre seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but as ahab looked up he slid aside “what’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for” muttered stubb looking on from the forecastle “at parsee smells ﬁre like a fusee and smells of it himself like a hot musket’s powderpan” at last the shank in one complete rod received its ﬁnal heat and as perth to temper it plunged it

brandingiron then” “pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not this harpoon for the white whale” “for the white ﬁend but now for the barbs thou must make them thyself man here are my razors —the best of steel here and make the barbs sharp as the needlesleet of the icy sea” for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them “take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray till—but here—to work” fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their ﬁnal heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place the watercask near “no no—no water for that i want it of the true deathtemper ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb” holding it high up a cluster of dark nods replied yes ree punures were made in the heathen ﬂesh and the white whale’s barbs were then tempered “ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli” deliriously howled ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood now mustering the spare poles from below and seleing one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab ﬁtted the end to the socket of the iron a coil of new towline was then unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harpstring then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed “good and now for the seizings” at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope was traced half way along the pole’s length and ﬁrmly secured so with intertwistings of twine is done pole iron and rope—like the ree fates—remained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin a light unnatural

their uprising though with but small success for their pains at such times under an abated sun aﬂoat all day upon smooth slow heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearthstone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean’s skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang ese are the times when in his whaleboat the rover softly feels a certain ﬁlial conﬁdent landlike feeling towards the sea that he regards it as so much ﬂowery earth and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not though high rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when the western emigrants’ horses only show their ereed ears while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure e longdrawn virgin vales the mild blue hillsides as over these there steals the hush the hum you almost swear that playwearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad maytime when the

weeks after ahab’s harpoon had been welded it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vaingloriously sailing round among the widely separated ships on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home e three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks of all colors were ﬂying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her topmast crosstrees you saw slender breakers of the same precious ﬂuid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp as was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single ﬁsh not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the captain’s and oﬃcers’ staterooms even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling wood and the cabin mess dined oﬀ the broad head of an oilbutt lashed down to the ﬂoor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had aually caulked and pitched their chests and ﬁlled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and ﬁlled it that the steward had plugged his spare coﬀeepot and ﬁlled it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and ﬁlled them that indeed everything was ﬁlled with sperm except the captain’s pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust his hands into in self complacent testimony of his entire satisfaion as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbar ian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge trypots which covered with the parchmentlike poke or stomach skin of the black ﬁsh gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew on the quarterdeck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat ﬁrmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negroes with glitter ing ﬁddlebows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ship’s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try works from which the huge pots had been removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastile such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea lord and master over all this scene the captain stood ere on the ship’s el evated quarterdeck so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion and ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each other’s wakes—one all jubila tions for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to come —their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene “come aboard come aboard” cried the gay bachelor’s commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air “hast seen the white whale” gritted ahab in reply “no only heard of him but don’t believe in him at all” said the other good humoredly “come aboard” “ou are too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men” “not enough to speak of—two islanders that’s all —but come aboard old hearty come along i’ll soon take that black from your brow come along will ye merry’s the play a full ship and homewardbound” “how wondrous familiar is a fool” muttered ahab then aloud “ou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayest well then call me an empty ship and outwardbound so go thy ways and i will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind” and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stub bornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding bachelor but the bach elor’s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taﬀrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial

gay bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab it was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson ﬁght were done and ﬂoating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the manilla isles the spanish land breeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymns soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sterned oﬀ from the whale sat intently watching his ﬁnal wanings from the now tranquil boat for that strange speacle observable in all sperm whales dying —the turning sunwards of the head and so expiring—that strange speacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before “he turns and turns him to it—how slowly but how steadfastly his homage rendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions he too worships ﬁre most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sun—oh that these toofavoring eyes should see these toofavoring sights look here far waterlocked beyond all hum of human weal or woe in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets where for long chinese ages the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shine upon the niger’s unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith but see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads some other way—” “oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas thou art an inﬁ del thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the wideslaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round again without a lesson to me” “oh

calls forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable imminglings ﬂoat beneath me here i am buoyed by breaths of once living

whale’s broad ﬂank like soft surf upon a beach ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that sperally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air started from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a ﬂooded world “i have dreamed it again” said he “of the hearses have i not said old man that neither hearse nor coﬃn can be thine” “and who are hearsed that die on the sea” “but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the ﬁrst not

thee” “e gallows ye mean—i am immortal then on land and on sea” cried ahab with a laugh of derision—“immortal on land and on sea” both were silent again as one man e grey dawn came on and the slumber ing crew arose from the boat’s bottom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship chapter cx the quadrant e season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally ﬁxed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ship’s prow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon high noon and ahab seated in the bows of his highhoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily obervation of the sun to determine his latitude now in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets of eﬀulgences at unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean’s immeasureable burningglass e sky looks lacquered clouds there are none the horizon ﬂoats and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insuﬀerable splendors of god’s throne well that ahab’s quadrant was furnished with colored glasses through which to take sight of that solar ﬁre so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrologicallooking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck and with face thrown up like ahab’s was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant en falling into a moment’s revery he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself “ou seamark thou high and mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where i am—but canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living where is moby dick is instant thou must be eyeing him ese eyes of mine look into the

after the other its numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered “foolish toy babies’ plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more ou canst not

and the level deadreckoning by log and by line these shall condu me and show me my place on the sea aye” lighting from the boat to the deck “thus i trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee” as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the mute motionless parsee’s face unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspe of their com mander the seamen clustered together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pa cing the deck shouted out—“to the braces up helm—square in” in an instant the yards swung round and as the ship halfwheeled upon her heel her three ﬁrmseated graceful masts erely poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one suﬃcient steed standing between the knightheads starbuck watched the pequod’s tumultu ous way and ahab’s also as he went lurching along the deck “i have sat before the dense coal ﬁre and watched it all aglow full of its tor mented ﬂaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust old man of oceans of all this ﬁery life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes” “aye” cried stubb “but seacoal ashes—mind ye that mr starbuck—sea coal not your common charcoal well well i heard ahab mutter “here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine swears that i must play them and no others“ and damn me ahab but thou aest right live in the

it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town towards evening of that day the pequod was torn of her canvas and bare poled was left to ﬁght a typhoon which had struck her direly ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts ﬂuttering here and there with the rags which the ﬁrst fury of the tempest had left for its after sport holding by a shroud starbuck was standing on the quarterdeck at every ﬂash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask were direing the men in the higher hoisting and ﬁrmer lashing of the boats but all their pains seemed naught ough lifted to the very top of the cranes the windward quarter boat ahab’s did not escape a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ship’s high tetering side stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like a sieve “bad work bad work mr starbuck” said stubb regarding the wreck “but the sea will have its way stubb for one can’t ﬁght it you see mr starbuck a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring but as for me all the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never

blackness of doom but to leeward home ward—i see it lightens up there but not with the lightning” at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following the ﬂashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead “who’s there” “old under” said ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot hole but suddenly ﬁnding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of ﬁre now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry oﬀ the per ilous ﬂuid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast is intended to condu it into the water but as this conduor must des cend to considerable depth that its end may avoid all conta with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and more or less imped ing the vessel’s way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a ship’s lightningrods are not always overboard but are generally made in long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require “e rods the rods” cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting ﬂambeaux to light ahab to his post “are they overboard drop them over fore and aft quick” “avast” cried ahab “let’s have fair play here though we be the weaker side yet i’ll contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges let them be sir” “look aloft” cried starbuck “e st elmo’s lights corpus sani cor pusants the corpusants” all the yardarms were tipped with a pallid ﬁre and touched at each tri pointed lightningrodend with three tapering white ﬂames each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar “blast the boat let it go” cried stubb at this instant as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing “blast it”—but slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the ﬂames and immediately shifting his tone he cried—“e corpusants have mercy on us all” to sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses from the topsailyard arms when most they teter over to a seething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when god’s burning ﬁnger has been laid on the ship when his “mene mene tekel upharsin” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage while this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the en chanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eyes gleam ing in that pale phosphorescence like a far away constellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come e parted mouth of tashtego revealed his sharkwhite teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light queequeg’s tattooing burned like satanic blue ﬂames on his body e tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it was stubb “what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was not the same in the song” “no no it wasn’t i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i hope they will still but do they only have mercy on long faces—have they no bowels for a laugh and look ye mr starbuck—but it’s too dark to look hear me then i take that masthead ﬂame we saw for a sign of good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be

at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb’s face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried “see see” and once more the high tapering ﬂames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor “e corpusants have mercy on us all” cried stubb again at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the ﬂame the parsee was kneeling in ahab’s front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen arrested by the glare now co hered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasps from a droop ing orchard twig in various enchanted attitudes like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eyes upcast “aye aye men” cried ahab “look up at it mark it well the white ﬂame but lights the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against ﬁre so” en turning—the last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot upon the parsee and with ﬁxed upward eye and high ﬂung right arm he stood ere before the lofty tripointed trinity of ﬂames “oh thou clear spirit of clear ﬁre whom on these seas i as persian once did worship till in the sacramental a so burned by

whale boat’s bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop oﬀ and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled ﬂame of pale forked ﬁre as the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent’s tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the arm—“god god is against thee old man forbear t’is an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this” overhearing starbuck the panicstricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though not a sail was left aloft for the moment all the aghast mate’s thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transﬁx with it the ﬁrst sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end petriﬁed by his aspe and still more shrinking from the ﬁery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke— “all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old ahab is bound and that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus i blow out the last fear” and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the ﬂame as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men ﬂy the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of ahab’s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay

reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to it—for they were slack —because some play to the tiller was indispensable in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus with the pequod’s at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is a sight that hardly any one can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion some hours after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb—one engaged forward and the other aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and maintopsails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when that stormtossed bird is on the wing e three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a stormtrysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the course—for the present east southeast—which he was to steer if praicable was once more given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of ”ho the fair wind oh heyo cheerly men“ the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsiﬁed the evil portents preceding it in compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report imme diately and at any one of the twentyfour hours any decided change in the aﬀairs of the deck—starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze—however reluantly and gloomily—than he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance ere knocking at his stateroom he involuntarily paused before it a moment e cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was burning ﬁtfully and casting ﬁtful shadows upon the old man’s bolted door—a thin one with ﬁxed blinds inserted in place of upper panels e isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements e loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest upright man but out of starbuck’s heart at that instant when he saw the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself “he would have shot me once“ he murmured” yes there’s the very musket that he pointed at me —that one with the studded stock let me touch it—lift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lances strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and powder in the pan—that’s not good best spill it—wait i’ll cure myself of this i’ll hold the musket boldly while i think—i come to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and doom— that’s fair for moby dick it’s a fair wind that’s only fair for that accursed ﬁsh—e very tube he pointed at me —the very one this one—i hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i handle now—aye and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the errorabounding log and in this very typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightningrods but shall this crazed old man be tamely suﬀered to drag a whole ship’s company down to doom with him—yes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this instant—put aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in his sleep yes just there—in there he’s sleeping sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again i can’t withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own ﬂat commands this is all thou breathest aye and say’st the men have vow’d thy vow say’st all of us are ahabs great god forbid—but is there no other way no lawful way—make him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest this old man’s living power from his own living hands only a fool would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ringbolts on this cabin ﬂoor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the sight could not possibly ﬂy

this way a touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again—oh mary mary—boy boy boy—but if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what un sounded deeps starbuck’s body this

moby dick i clutch thy heart at last” such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man’s tormen ted sleep as if starbuck’s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak e yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’s arm against the panel starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the death tube in its rack and left the place “he’s too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him i must see to the deck here ou know’st what to say” chapter cxv the needle next morning the notyetsubsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk and striving in the pequod’s gurgling track pushed her on like giants’ palms out spread e strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world boomed before the wind muﬄed in the full morning light the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned babylonian kings and queens reigned over everything e sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the sun’s rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake “ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the seachariot of the sun ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to ye yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea” but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading “eastsoueast sir” said the frightened steersman “ou liest” smiting him with his clenched ﬁst “heading east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern” upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very blinding palpable ness must have been the cause rusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west but ere the ﬁrst wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed “i have it it has happened before mr starbuck last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s all ou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it” “aye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily here it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms e magnetic energy as developed in the mariner’s needle is as all know essentially one with the elericity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be in instances where the lightning has aually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging the eﬀe upon the needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be aﬀeed the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed com passes the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisﬁed that the needles were exaly inverted shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be changed accordingly e yards were hard up and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings—likewise unmurmuringly ac quiesced as for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate but as ever before the pagan harpooneers re mained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inﬂexible ahab’s for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper sighttubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck “ou poor proud heavengazer and sun’s pilot yesterday i wrecked thee and to day the compasses would feign have wrecked me so so but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbuck—a lance without a pole a topmaul and the smallest of the sailmaker’s needles quick” accessory perhaps to the impulse diating the thing he was now about to do were certain prudential motives whose obje might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpoin ted needles though clumsily praicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents “men” said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him the things he had demanded “my men the thunder turned old ahab’s needles but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any” abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow but starbuck looked away with a blow from the topmaul ahab knocked oﬀ the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it up right without its touching the deck en with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before en going through some small strange motions with it—whether indis pensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertain —he called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sail needle by its middle over one of the compasscards at ﬁrst the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed—“look ye for yourselves if ahab be not the lord of the level loadstone e sun is east and that compass swears it” one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk away in his ﬁery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride “ chapter cxvi the lifebuoy steering now southeastward by ahab’s levelled steel and her progress solely de termined by ahab’s level log and line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some ri otous and desperate scene at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the equatorial ﬁshingground and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watch—then headed by flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly—like halfarticulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod’s murdered innocents—that one and all they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transﬁxedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing e christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled yet the grey manxman—the oldest mariner of all —declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder ose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this only the more aﬀeed some of them because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress but also from the hu man look of their round heads and semiintelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible conﬁrm ation in the fate of one of their number that morning at sunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was heard—a cry and a rush ing—and looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea e lifebuoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it slowly ﬁlled and the parched wood also ﬁlled at its every pore and the studded iron bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one and thus the ﬁrst man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale on the white whale’s own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulﬁlment of an evil already presaged ey declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay e lost lifebuoy was now to be replaced starbuck was direed to see to it but as no cask of suﬃcient lightness could be found and as in the feverish eager ness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was direly conneed with its ﬁnal end whatever that might prove to be therefore they were going to leave the ship’s stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint con cerning his coﬃn “a lifebuoy of a coﬃn” cried starbuck starting “rather queer that i should say”

descried bearing direly down upon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the time the pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life ﬂed from the smitten hull “bad news she brings bad news” muttered the old manxman but ere her commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hopefully hail ahab’s voice was heard “hast seen the white whale” “aye yesterday have ye seen a whaleboat adrift” rottling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpeed question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessel’s way was seen descending her side a few keen pulls and his boathook soon clinched the pequod’s main chains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was recognized by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation was exchanged “where was he—not killed—not killed” cried ahab closely advancing “how was it” it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales which had led them some four or ﬁve miles from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the blue water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been instantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in fastening —at least as well as the man at the masthead could tell anything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indeﬁnitely run away with his pursuers as often happens ere was some apprehension but no positive alarm as yet e recall signals were placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direion—the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail —after the missing boat kindling a ﬁre in her trypots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the lookout but though when she had thus sailed a suﬃcient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her and not ﬁnding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and though she had thus continued doing till day light yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen e story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his ob je in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or ﬁve miles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were “i will wager something now” whispered stubb to flask “that some one in that missing boat wore oﬀ that captain’s best coat mayhap his watch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two pious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in the height of the whaling season see flask only see how pale he looks—pale in the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been the—” “my boy my own boy is among them for god’s sake—i beg i conjure—here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition for eightandforty hours let me charter your ship—i will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for it—if there be no other way—for eightandforty hours only—only that—you must oh you must and you shall do this thing” “his son” cried stubb “oh it’s his son he’s lost i take back the coat and watch—what says ahab we must save that boy” “he’s drowned with the rest on ’em last night” said the old manx sailor stand ing behind them “i heard all of ye heard their spirits” now as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachel’s the more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of the captain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew but among the number of the other boat’s crews at the same time but on the other hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whaleship in such emergencies that is when placed between jeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the majority ﬁrst but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer’s paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor does it unfrequently occur that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protraed three or four years’ voyage in some other ship than their own so that their ﬁrst knowledge of a whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father’s natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern meantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab and ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without the least quivering of his own “i will not go” said the stranger “till you say aye to me do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy captain ahab—though but a child and nestling safely at home now—a child of your old age too—yes yes you relent i see it—run run men now and stand by to square in the yards” “avast” cried ahab—“touch not a ropeyarn” then in a voice that prolong ingly moulded every word—“captain gardiner i will not do it even now i lose time good bye good bye god bless ye man and may i forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minutes from this present instant warn oﬀ all strangers then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before” hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transﬁxed at this unconditional and utter rejeion of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his boat and returned to his ship soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea is way and that her yards were swung round starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men as three tall cherry trees when the boys are cherrying among the boughs but by her still halting course and winding woful way you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort she was rachel weeping for her children because they were not chapter cxix

ahab—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have chased his foe into an oceanfold to slay him the more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inﬂied now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had aually encountered moby dick—and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indiﬀerence with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a something in the old man’s eyes which it was hardly suﬀerable for feeble souls to see as the unsetting polar star which through the livelong aric six months’ night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so ahab’s purpose now ﬁxedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it dom ineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to ﬁnest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahab’s iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was on them but did you deeply scan him in his more secret conﬁdential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s the inscrutable parsee’s glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times aﬀeed it such an added glid ing strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being’s body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below he would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say—we two watchmen never rest now at any time by night or day could the mariners now step up the deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivothole or exaly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits—the mainmast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabinscuttle—his living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether he was still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded nightdamp gathered in beads of dew upon that stonecarved coat and hat e clothes that the night had wet the next day’s sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for he ate in the same open air that is his two only meals —breakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck and though the parsee’s mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary ough such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awestruck crew they seemed polelike asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but still ﬁxedly gazing upon each other as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance and yet somehow did ahab—in his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinates—ahab seemed an in dependent lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid ahab at the ﬁrst faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aft—“man the mastheads”—and all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsman’s bell was heard —“what d’ye see—sharp sharp” but when three or four days had slided by after meeting the children seeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed dis trustful of his crew’s ﬁdelity at least of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his aions might seem to hint them “i will have the ﬁrst sight of the whale myself”—he said “aye ahab must have the doubloon” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail is done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his ﬁrm relying eye upon the chief mate said—“take the rope sir—i give it into thy hands starbuck” en arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles—ahead astern this side and that—within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chances to aﬀord no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in stri charge to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various diﬀerent relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deckends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea so ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision —one of those too whose faithfulness on the lookout he had seemed to doubt somewhat—it was strange that this was the very man he should sele for his watchman freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person’s hands now the ﬁrst time ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often ﬂy incommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circ lings en it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized down wards and went eddying again round his head but with his gaze ﬁxed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight “your hat your hat sir” suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizenmast head stood direly behind ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them but already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize an eagle ﬂew thrice round tarquin’s head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good ahab’s hat was never restored the wild hawk ﬂew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea chapter cxxi the pequod meets the delight e intense pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the lifebuoy coﬃn still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the delight was descried as she drew nigh all eyes were ﬁxed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whalingships cross the quarterdeck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and some few splintered planks of what had once been a whaleboat but you now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled halfunhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse “hast seen the white whale” “look” replied the hollow cheeked captain from his taﬀrail and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck “hast killed him” “e harpoon is not yet forged that will ever do that” answered the other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together “not forged” and snatching perth’s levelled iron from the crotch ahab held it out exclaiming—“look ye nantucketer here in this hand i hold his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the ﬁn where the white whale most feels his accursed life” “en god keep thee old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the hammock —“i bury but one of ﬁve stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were buried before they died you sail upon their tomb” en turning to his crew—“are ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so then— oh god”—advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands —“may the resurreion and the life—” “brace forward up helm” cried ahab like lightning to his men but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick indeed but that some of the ﬂying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism as ahab now glided from the dejeed delight the strange lifebuoy hanging at the pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief “ha yonder look yonder men” cried a foreboding voice in her wake “in vain oh ye strangers ye ﬂy our sad burial ye but turn us your taﬀrail to show us your coﬃn” chapter cxxii the symphony it was a clear steelblue day e ﬁrmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that allpervading azure only the pensive air was transparently pure and soft with a woman’s look and the robust and manlike sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as samson’s chest in his sleep hither and thither on high glided the snowwhite wings of small unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathans swordﬁsh and sharks and these were the strong troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea but though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shades and shad ows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as it were that distin guished them aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motion—most seen here at the equator —denoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly ﬁrm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin untot tering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s forehead of heaven oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old ahab’s closecoiled woe but so have i seen little miriam and martha laughing eyed elves heedlessly gambol around their old sire sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burntout crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul at glad happy air that winsome sky did at last stroke and caress him the stepmother world so long cruel— forbidding—now threw aﬀeionate arms round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet ﬁnd it in her heart to save and to bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the paciﬁc contain such wealth as that one wee drop starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there ahab turned “starbuck” “sir” “oh starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on

deadly waters let us home wife and child too are starbuck’s—wife and child of his brotherly sisterly playfellow youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age away let us away—this instant let me alter the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would we bowl on our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they have some such mild blue days even as this in nantucket“ “ey have they have i have seen them—some summer days in the morning about this time —yes it is his noon nap now—the boy vivaciously wakes sits up in bed and his mother tells him of me of cannibal old me how i am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back to dance him again” “tis my mary my mary herself she promised that my boy every morning should be carried to the hill to catch the ﬁrst glimpse of his father’s sail yes yes no more it is done we head for nantucket come my captain study out the course and let us away see see the boy’s face from the window the boy’s hand on the hill” but ahab’s glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil “what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozzen ing hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor commands me that against all natural lovings and longings i so keep pushing and crowding and jam ming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not so much as dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lifts this arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is as an errandboy in

we how we may we all sleep at last on the ﬁeld sleep aye and rust amid greenness as last year’s scythes ﬂung down and left in the halfcut swaths —starbuck” but blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair the mate had stolen away ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reﬂec ted ﬁxed eyes in the water there fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail chapter cxxiii the chase—the first day at night in the midwatch when the old man —as his wont at intervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivothole he suddenly thrust out his face ﬁercely snuﬃng up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any mariner surprised when after inspeing the compass and then the dogvane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible ahab rapidly ordered the ship’s course to be slightly altered and the sail to be shortened e acute policy diating these movements was suﬃciently vindicated at day break by the sight of a long sleek on the sea direly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metalliclike marks of some swift tide rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream “man the mastheads call all hands” undering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands “what d’ye see” cried ahab ﬂattening his face to the sky “nothing nothing sir” was the sound hailing down in reply “t’gallant sails—stunsails alow and aloft and on both sides” all sail being set he now cast loose the lifeline reserved for swaying him to the main royalmast head and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the maintop sail and topgallantsail he raised a gulllike cry in the air “ere she blows —there she blows a hump like a snowhill it is moby dick” fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three lookouts the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gained his ﬁnal perch some feet above the other lookouts tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the topgallant mast so that the indian’s head was almost on a level with ahab’s heel from this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans “and did none of ye see it before” cried ahab hailing the perched men all around him“ “i saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab did and i cried out” said tashtego “not the same instant not the same —no the doubloon is mine fate reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could have raised the white whale ﬁrst ere she blows there she blows—there she blows ere again—there again he cried in longdrawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale’s visible jets “he’s going to sound in stunsails down top gallantsails stand by three boats mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship helm there luﬀ luﬀ a point so steady man steady ere go ﬂukes no no only black water all ready the boats there stand by stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lower—quick quicker” and he slid through the air to the deck “he is heading straight to leeward sir” cried stubb “right away from us cannot have seen the ship yet” “be dumb man stand by the braces hard down the helm—brace up shiver her—shiver her so well that boats boats” soon all the boats but starbuck’s were dropped all the boatsails set—all the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale deathglimmer lit up fedallah’s sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe as they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed a noonmeadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspeing prey that his entire dazzling hump was distinly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of ﬁnest ﬂeecy greenish foam he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projeing head beyond before it far out on the soft turkish rugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompany ing the shade and behind the blue waters interchangeably ﬂowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their ﬁtful ﬂight and like to some ﬂagstaﬀ rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projeed from the white whale’s back and at intervals one of the cloud of softtoed fowls hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the ﬁsh silently perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feathers streaming like pennons a gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching ﬂeetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme did surpass the gloriﬁed white whale as he so divinely swam on each soft side—coincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then ﬂowed so wide away—on each bright side the whale shed oﬀ enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the ﬁrst time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before and thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among waves whose handclappings were suspended by exceeding rapture moby dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginia’s natural bridge and warningly waving his bannered ﬂukes in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white seafowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left with oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats now stilly ﬂoated awaiting moby dick’s reappearance “an hour” said ahab standing rooted in his boat’s stern and he gazed bey ond the whale’s place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle e breeze now freshened the sea began to swell “e birds—the birds” cried tashtego in long indian ﬁle as when herons take wing the white birds were now all ﬂying towards ahab’s boat and when within a few yards began ﬂuttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expeant cries eir vision was keener than man’s ahab could discover no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth ﬂoating up from the undiscoverable bottom it was moby dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea e glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition en calling upon fedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and seizing perth’s harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow by anticipation was made to face the whale’s head while yet under water but as if perceiving this strategem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat rough and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock e bluish pearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab’s head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the tigeryellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the uttermost stern and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being sub merged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it was that mono maniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two ﬂoating wrecks ese ﬂoated aside the broken ends drooping the crew at the sternwreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across at that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the ﬁrst to perceive the whale’s intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one ﬁnal eﬀort to push the boat out of the bite but only slipping further into the whale’s mouth and tilting over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken oﬀ his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell ﬂatfaced upon the sea ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet out of the water—the now rising swells with all their conﬂuent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindiively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air so in a gale the but half baﬄed channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault e sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus’s elephants in the book of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale’s insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim —though he could still keep aﬂoat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless ahab’s head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst from the boat’s fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not succor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves for so revolvingly ap palling was the white whale’s aspe and so planetarily swift the evercontraing circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruion of the jeop ardized castaways ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape with straining eyes then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old man’s head meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed her—“sail on the”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and whelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shouted— “sail on the whale—drive him oﬀ” e pequod’s prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she eﬀeually parted the white whale from his viim as he sullenly swam oﬀ the boats ﬂew to the rescue dragged into stubb’s boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the white brine cak ing in his wrinkles the long tension of ahab’s bodily strength did crack and help lessly he yielded to his body’s doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb’s boat like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from him as desolate sounds from out ravines but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more ab breviate it in an instant’s compass great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diﬀused through feebler men’s whole lives and so such hearts though summary in each one suﬀering still if the gods decree it in their life time aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls “e harpoon” said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one bended arm—“is it safe” “aye sir for it was not darted this is it” said stubb showing it “lay it before me—any missing men” “one two three four ﬁve—there were ﬁve oars sir and here are ﬁve men” “at’s good—help me man i wish to stand so so i see him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spout hands oﬀ from me e eternal sap runs up in ahab’s bones again set the sail out oars the helm” it is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued with what is called doublebanked oars it was thus now but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale for he seemed to have treblebanked his every ﬁn swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstances pushed on the chase would prove an indeﬁnitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude e ship itself then as it sometimes happens oﬀered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it with stunsails like the doublejointed wings of an albatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby dick at the well known methodic intervals the whale’s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mastheads and when he would be reported as just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice was heard—“whose is the doubloon now d’ye see him” and if the reply was no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the planks as he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quarter deck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern at last he paused before it and as in an already overclouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old man’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his captain’s mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“e thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha” “what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck man man did i not know thee brave as fearless ﬁre and as mechanical i could swear thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck” “aye sir” said starbuck drawing near “’tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one” “omen omen—the diionary if the gods think to speak outright to man they will honorably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old wives’ darkling hint—begone ye two are the opposite poles of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and ye two are all mankind and ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neigh bors cold cold—i shiver—how now aloft there d’ye see him sing out for every spout though he spout ten times a second” e day was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe was rustling soon it was almost dark but the lookout men still remained unset “can’t see the spout now sir —too dark”—cried a voice from the air “how heading when last seen” “as before sir —straight to leeward” “good he will travel slower now ’tis night down royals and topgallant stunsails mr starbuck we must not run over him before morning he’s making a passage now and may heaveto a while helm there keep her full before the wind—aloft come down—mr stubb send a fresh hand to the foremast head and see it manned till morning”—en advancing towards the doubloon in the mainmast—“men this gold is mine for i earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead and then whosoever of ye ﬁrst raises him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that man’s and if on that day i shall again raise him then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye away now—the deck is thine sir” and so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on is motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its designation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary upanddown poise of the whalelance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objes may be encircling him chapter cxxiv the chase—third day e morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the solitary nightman at the foremasthead was relieved by crowds of the daylight lookouts who dotted every mast and almost every spar “d’ye see him” cried ahab but the whale was not yet in sight “in his infallible wake though but follow that wake that’s all helm there steady as thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day again were it a new made world and made for a summerhouse to the angels and this morning the ﬁrst of its throwing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world here’s food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels that’s tingling enough for mortal man to think’s audacity god only has that right and privilege inking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that and yet i’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contents turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no it’s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as ﬂeeces out upon it—it’s tainted were i the wind i’d blow no more on such a wicked miserable world i’d crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet ’tis a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every ﬁght it has the last and bitterest blow run tilting at it and you but run through it ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing that that would now the wind but had a body but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are bodiless but only bodiless as objes not as agents ere’s a most special a most cunning oh a most malicious diﬀerence and yet i say again and swear it now that there’s something all glorious and gracious in the wind ese warm trade winds at least that in the clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal poles these same trades that so direly blow my good ship on these trades or something like them—something so unchangeable and full as strong

he’s chasing me now not i him—that’s bad i might have known it too fool the lines—the harpoons he’s towing aye aye i have run him by last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look outs man the braces” steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the pequod’s quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direion the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake “against the wind he now steers for the open jaw” murmured starbuck to himself as he coiled the newhauled main brace upon the rail “god keep us but already my bones feel damp within me and from the inside wet my ﬂesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him” “stand by to sway me up” cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket “we should meet him soon” “aye aye sir” and straightway starbuck did ahab’s bidding and once more ahab swung on high a whole hour now passed goldbeaten out to ages time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense but at last some three points oﬀ the weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mastheads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of ﬁre had voiced it “forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck there—brace sharper up crowd her into the wind’s eye he’s too far oﬀ to lower yet mr starbuck e sails shake stand over that helmsman with a top maul so so

descend those endless stairs and all night i’ve been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself o parsee but ahab there thy shot fell short good by mast head—keep a good eye upon the whale the while i’m gone we’ll talk tomorrow nay tonight when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail” he gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck in due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallop’s stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the mate —who held one of the tackleropes on deck—and bade him pause “starbuck” “sir” “for the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage starbuck” “aye sir thou wilt have it so” “some ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards are missing starbuck” “truth sir saddest truth” “some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of the ﬂood—and i feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb starbuck i am old—shake hands with me man” eir hands met their eyes fastened starbuck’s tears the glue “oh my captain my captain—noble heart—go not—go not— see it’s a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then” “lower away”—cried ahab tossing the mate’s arm from him “stand by the crew” in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern “e sharks the sharks” cried a voice from the low cabinwindow there “o master my master come back” but ahab heard nothing for his own voice was highlifted then and the boat leaped on yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when num bers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull ma liciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites it is a thing not uncom monly happening to the whaleboats in those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east but these were the ﬁrst sharks that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been ﬁrst descried and whether it was that ahab’s crew were all such tiger yellow barbarians and therefore their ﬂesh more musky to the senses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to aﬀe them—however it was they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others “heart of wrought steel” murmured starbuck gazing over the side and follow ing with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight”—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by them openmouthed to the chase and this the critical third day—for when three days ﬂow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure the ﬁrst is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may oh my god what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet expeant—ﬁxed at the top of a shudder future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim mary girl thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy i seem to see but thy eyes grown won drous blue strangest problems of life seem clearing but clouds sweep between —is my journey’s end coming my legs feel faint like his who has footed it all day feel thy heart—beats it yet—stir thyself starbuck—stave it oﬀ—move move speak aloud —masthead there see ye my boy’s hand on the hill—crazed —aloft there—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats—mark well the whale—ho again—drive oﬀ that hawk see he pecks—he tears the vane—pointing to the red ﬂag ﬂying at the maintruck—“ha he soars away with it—where’s the old man now sees’t thou that sight oh ahab—shudder shudder” e boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheads—a downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow “drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost heads drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coﬃn and no hearse can be mine—and hemp only can kill me ha ha” suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters ﬂashed for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of ﬂakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale “give way” cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to the attack but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven e wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transpar ent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more ﬂailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates’ boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving ahab’s almost without a scar while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire ﬂank as he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round and round to the ﬁsh’s back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab e harpoon dropped from his hand “befooled befooled”—drawing in a long lean breath—“aye parsee i see thee again—aye and thou goest before and this this then is the hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word where is the second hearse away mates to the ship those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not ahab is enough to die—down men the ﬁrst thing that but oﬀers to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey me—where’s the whale gone down again” but he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed the ship—which thus far had been sailing in the contrary dir eion to him though for the present her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea “oh ahab” cried starbuck “not too late is it even now the third day to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou that madly seekest him” setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck’s face as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mast heads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them one after the other through the portholes as he sped he also caught ﬂying glimpses of stubb and flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or ﬂag was gone from the mainmasthead he shouted to tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another ﬂag and a hammer and nails and so nail it to the mast whether fagged by the three days’ running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some latent deceit fulness and malice in him whichever was true the white whale’s way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whale’s last start had not been so long a one as before and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him and so per tinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip “heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pull on ’tis the better rest the shark’s jaw than the yielding water” “but at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller” “ey will last long enough pull on—but who can tell”—he muttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on ahab—but pull on aye all alive now—we near him e helm take the helm let me pass”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still ﬂying boat at length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whale’s ﬂank he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance—as the whale sometimes will—and ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown oﬀ from the whale’s spout curled round his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when with body arched back and both arms lengthwise highlifted to the poise he darted his ﬁerce iron and his far ﬁercer curse into the hated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked into a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh ﬂank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea as it was three of the oarsmen—who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its eﬀes —these were ﬂung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but still aﬂoat and swimming almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air “what breaks in me some sinew cracks—’tis whole again oars oars burst in upon him” hearing the tremendous rush of the seacrashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking it —it may be—a larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid ﬁery showers of foam ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead “i grow blind hands stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way is’t night” “e whale e ship” cried the cringing oarsmen “oars oars slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ere it be for ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i see the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship” but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledgehammering seas the before whalesmitten bowends of two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its halfwading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water meantime for that one beholding instant tashtego’s masthead hammer re mained suspended in his hand and the red ﬂag halfwrapping him as with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forwardﬂowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the downcoming monster just as soon as he “e whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet powers of air now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a woman’s fainting ﬁt up helm i say—ye fools the jaw the jaw is this the end of all my bursting prayers all my lifelong ﬁdelities oh ahab ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again he turns to meet us oh his unappeasable brow drives on towards one whose duty tells him he cannot depart my god stand by me now” “stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help stubb for stubb too sticks here i grin at thee thou grinning whale who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubb’s own unwinking eye and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft would it were stuﬀed with brushwood i grin at thee thou grinning whale look ye sun moon and stars i call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but there’ll be plenty of gulping soon why ﬂy ye not o ahab for me oﬀ shoes and jacket to it let stubb die in his drawers a most mouldy and over salted death though —cherries cherries cherries oh flask for one red cherry ere we die” “cherries i only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope my poor mother’s drawn my partpay ere this if not few coppers will now come to her for the voyage is up” from the ship’s bows nearly all the seamen now hung inaive hammers bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retained in their hands just as they had darted from their various employments all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole aspe and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship’s starboard bow till men and timbers reeled some fell ﬂat upon their faces like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bulllike necks rough the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrents down a ﬂume “e ship e hearse—the second hearse” cried ahab from the boat “its wood could only be american” diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far oﬀ the other bow but within a few yards of ahab’s boat where for a time he lay quiescent “i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer oh ye three unsurrendered spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only god bullied hull thou ﬁrm deck and haughty helm and polepointed prow —death glorious ship must ye then perish and without me am i cut oﬀ from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains oh lonely death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief ho ho from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in ye bold billows of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber of my death towards thee i roll thou alldestroying but unconquering whale to the last i grapple with thee from hell’s heart i stab at thee for hate’s sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coﬃns and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale us i give up the spear” e harpoon was darted the stricken whale ﬂew forward with igniting velo city the line ran through the groove—ran foul ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the ﬂying turn caught him round the neck and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their viim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone next instant the heavy eyesplice in the rope’s ﬁnal end ﬂew out of the starkempty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in its depths for an instant the tranced boat’s crew stood still then turned “e ship great god where is the ship” soon they through dim bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous fata morgana only the uppermost masts out of water while ﬁxed by infatuation or ﬁdelity or fate to their once lofty perches the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea and now concentric circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each ﬂoating oar and every lancepole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the ere spar yet vis ible together with long streaming yards of the ﬂag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billows they almost touched—at that in stant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the a of nailing the ﬂag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a skyhawk that tauntingly had followed the maintruck downwards from its natural home among the stars pecking at the ﬂag and incommoding tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept its broad ﬂuttering wing between the hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submerged savage be neath in his deathgasp kept his hammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole cap tive form folded in the ﬂag of ahab went down with his ship which like satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it now small fowls ﬂew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides then all collapsed and the great shroud of
